Okay... then how 'bout we try out some French cuisine.  Saturday?  Night?
Forget it.
Eber's Deep Conditioner every two days. And I never, ever use a blowdryer without the diffuser attachment.
Lesbian?  No. I found a picture of Jared Leto in one of her drawers, so I'm pretty sure she's not harboring same-sex tendencies.
I believe we share an art instructor
You always been this selfish?
Thank God!  If I had to hear one more story about your coiffure...
No
They do not!
No.
Hi, Joey.
Why?
God, you're just like him! Just keep me locked away in the dark, so I can't experience anything for myself
So did you
You set me up.
And where're you going?
Daddy, no!
I have a date, Daddy.  And he ' s not a captain of oppression like some men we know.
North, actually.  How'd you   ?
Bianca Stratford.  Sophomore. Don't even think about it
Unlikely, but even so, she still can't go out with you.  So what's the point?
Like we had a choice?  Besides -- when you let the enemy think he's orchestrating the battle, you're in a position of power. We let him pretend he's calling the shots, and while he's busy setting up the plan, you have time to woo Bianca.
Dead at forty-one.
It's her favorite band.
The hell is that?  What kind of 'guy just picks up a girl and carries her away while you're talking to her?
Yeah -- we'll see.
She's partial to Joey, not me
Sure
She just needs time to cool off I'll give it a day.
Not at all
Yeah, whatever.  I want you to go out with her.
You're gonna pay me to take out some girl?
I got her under control. She just acts crazed in public to keep up the image.
What?
But imagine the things he'd say during sex.
I did Bianca a favor and it backfired.
Who?
You know who The Raincoats are?
Because then I'd have to start taking out girls who like me.
Hey man. . .  You don ' t think I can be "cool"?  You don't think I can be "laid back" like everyone else?
Maybe.
I'm gettin' there
What are you doing here?
Unwelcome.
You know what I mean
No what?
Is that right?
Don ' t you even dare. . .
I thought we decided you were going to school here.  At U of 0.
Then tell them I had a seizure.
No ... I believe "heinous bitch" is the term used most often.
Just smack her now.
Dorsey can plow whoever he wants. I'm just in this for the cash.
We're your guys.
I'm likin' you guys better
Touch of the flu.
What's to discuss?
See you next week!
Make anyone cry today?
Tumescent!
We'll all go crazy...
On the contrary, Your Eminence.  It seems to me the man is preparing his own cross.
I know.
Forgive me, Don Bobadilla -- those positions have already been taken.
Appointment to what?
I am not a seaman.  But I heard it is no more than a week at sea.  I hope you are not too disappointed.
Yes... Yes, I do... On all of them!
This time with me!
Not bad.
No?
I'm not bargaining!
Forgive me, Don Colon.  But what about gold?
... for a commoner?
What...?  Do I have so many already?
Call them.
You never learned how to speak my language.
So was Christ!
I'll try to remember that, Marchena...
I've been contradicted all my life... Eternity!
Father, I have betrayed my family. I betrayed my men.  And I betrayed you.
Give me absolution.
You'll always be older than me, Father.
No more than the woman who said she would take Granada from the Moors.
Your Majesty -- some men are content to read about things.  I must see them with my own eyes.  I cannot be other than I am.
Immediately.
And then what?  Half of the water has gone, the rest is nearly putrid! You know that!
Where are we going?
No, he is here.  Shit...
No.  No way.
My father always degraded me.  Killed my self-esteem.  And my mother was blind.
I don't think it's abuse, I think it's torture.
Officers, there's your killer, do your duty, arrest him!
Yes, I considered it.
I'm just trying to find out who you are.
I'm from a small town in Slovakia.  Like the South here.  The Police is right, a civilian is wrong.  So I fled.
A shower!?  Did you take one, too?
Okay.  But not water sports.
What was I supposed to do?  The guy tried to mug me.  I was gonna send a cop back - I just forgot.
Police.  We'd like to ask you a few questions.
He had a videocamera?  Where is she? Quickly!
No, we don't mind.  You mind Leon?
There wasn't a fire.  There'll be nothing for you to do.
Hey.  I'm a professional.
Well, you shoulda because nobody's gonna believe you didn't...including me.
No, I don't think you were a fool, I just think you were stupid about it.  I mean, to say the least, you outta know better.  You don't know her well enough. She's got the potential to fucking hang you even if she suggests that you made a pass at her, it's fuckin' over.  You can deny it all you want, but it will not make one fucking bit of difference. You're dead.
You know, I don't know.  I like you. You remind me of a puppy I used to have. He pissed on the rug all the time, but I still kept him.
What's your accomplishment.
Yeah.  Now's not a good time.
I'm not.
Answer it.
No.  Go ahead.  You're gonna be great.
I'll tell you tonight.  Let's do it tonight.  As soon as you get back we'll talk.  We'll talk.
Yeah.  I promise.
I'll meet you on one condition - I get exclusivity and you surrender to me.
Let her go!  Let her go!!
Alright, alright - don't hurt me! Please, it's in my book, in my purse!
I have five-hundred dollars.
How long are you planning to stay?
New York's finest.  This is his case.
Okay.
I want to document my trip to America.
Shut up.  Look!
Be quiet.  Watch.
Because I am the director.  Don't you realize, if it wasn't for my film, for my talent, my idea to do this - no way would we be sitting here right now.
I want to hear everything he said.
Okay.  You're a Czech national and you're a Russian national.  How do you know one another?
Yes, we're in New York now.  But where are you planning to stay in New York?
Fire Department?  Firemen don't carry guns.
Oh yeah, why?
Clean?
There was a woman - I think she wanted to talk to us.  She looked scared.  Oh shit!  Oh no!
...so you feel absolutely no responsibility for killing these people?
You seem very savvy for a man who's been found mentally incompetent to stand trial.
Permanently disrupted?  Aren't you selling paintings now for quite a lot of money?  Hasn't this 'incident' as you call it, jump started your career as an artist?
And isn't there a movie in the works about you?
Well, I suppose they've been having a bit of trouble with some of the equipment.
Okay, come on down.
What's up?
I suppose so. Though, of course, there's a more sinister explanation.
Are you reasonably awake?
What is it, Hal?
Yes, I know.
Okay, Hal, well let's see the way things go from here on.
And don't you worry about it.
Yes, it is, Hal.
The antenna has to be replaced.
Hal, unless you follow my instructions, I shall be forced to disconnect you.
I know that you've had that on your mind for some time now, Dave, but it would be a crying shame, since I am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are, and I have such enthusiasm and confi- dence in the mission.
Did they have any explanation for this?
Well... it's silly, but... if you want to, why don't you?
Well, the only important aspect of the mission are: where are we going, what will we do when we get there, when are we coming back, and... why are we going?
Mommy's out to the hair- dresser.
How many days until you come home?
I suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later.
I'll bet it's a fortune.
Well, where are all of you off to?
Well, that does sound very odd.
I'm terribly sorry. I was just on my way down to meet you. I saw your ship dock and I knew I had plenty of time, and I was on my way out of the office when, suddenly, the phone rang.
Yes, very pleasant.
Are you quite sure?
Yes... Well, I hope the crew got back safely.
Tomb, shine, survey-marker spare part, take your choice.
We're scheduled to dock in about seven hours. Is there anything we can do for you?
No, of course, Captain, I can understand your concern.
True.
Thank you very much, Hal.
It looks like we have another bad A.O. unit. My FPC shows another impending failure.
Not really, Frank. I think there may be a flaw in the assembly procedure.
I want to pick up my car.
Hammond.
Vodka.
Try obeyin' the law once in awhile, and I won't have to hassle you...
He's just kiddin', you just keep doin' what I tell ya, you'll be okay.
Goodbye.
Here you go sweetheart, throw it my way.
No, baby, nothin' like that. Look, there's a place across the street. We can go right over there...
I just struck it rich... I think we can do a little business.  As a matter of fact, I think we can have a party.
Yeah.  Sure, i'm crazy in love with him, who wouldn't be...
No chance.
I don't think you're gonna make it.
Try Cates.  And let's talk in private, okay?
I can help you, man, but you gotta get me out.  I got to be on the street.  Get me outta here.
I got a lot to protect.
Why?  Anybody that talks about women as much as you do probably can't get it up anyway.
I don't know what you're talking about. I just wanna see Ganz nailed.
Some of us citizens are with you all the way, Officer.
You wanna leave, man?  Let me take care of Ganz all by myself.
Naw, you'd just call your pals back to bail you out one more time.
Me and my bunch hit a dealer in the middle of a sale. It's the kind of money nobody ever reports stolen. I was sittin' pretty, livin' in the high cotton, then somebody fingered me for another job. ... Some psycho who's out there capping people with some cop's gun.
Get this. We ain't partners. We ain't brothers. We ain't friends. If Ganz gets away with my money, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.
...For three years?  Let's hope it wasn't a tow-away zone.
Musta got some primo bondsman.
Tryin' to save his girl, man. He's in another world.
I let women get to me.  The quest for pussy is the meaning of life ... I got my own personal philosophy about 'em.  Keep women separate from guns, money and business ... women are for spending money.  They got nothing to do with helping you make it.
If they don't tell me what I need to know...
What you don't understand is, I don't give a damn about how this thing looks.
You missed ... Luther took a taxi to the hotel across the street. Made a phone call.
Let him get some sleep.  He's going to need it.
You sure that's the reason?
Bein' good at your job don't explain everything, Jack ...
I had it impounded.  Come on, we'll use it for haulin' you back to the slam.
Yeah, too bad.  They were real nice lookin' too...In bed together, hardly any clothes one watching TV...
Yeah.  But I wasn't there for a second.
There's nothin' to talk about.
No trouble, Jack. But, listen, suppose I stay a crook?  Where'd you get the idea that you could catch me?
Shit.
Here's the file. Cates checks the file.
So do you...been a long day.
Aw, bullshit, you heard wrong.
This is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world. You gotta ask yourself just one question. Are you feelin' lucky?
What'd you do?
Positive self-image problem all over again ... You are who you decide you are unless you're the type that lets assholes decide for you.
What do you want to know?  What difference does it make?  I'm the guy in your bed the last three months.  I make you feel good. You make me feel good.  What the hell else do you want from a guy?
You sure you want me to?
This is not the way people who care for each other are supposed to behave.
Jack, wait...
Hi, it's me...
Hiya, kid.
Come on, they were a little old for a slumber party.
Usual bullshit.  You make one smart move and everybody wants to be your friend... You know somethin', shootin' guys sucks. Especially compared to this.
That's no bull.
Can't complain.
Don't give me this, we were partners.
I can't get it until Monday. Honest.
First, the money.
This is clean shit.  No serial numbers and never been used...
San Agamat chay bet... envolet!
That's me.  But I don't know who she is... where did you find her?
What kind of mission?
Father, I was in the Army for awhile and every time they told us we were on a mission to save the world the only thing that changed was I lost a lot of friends. So thanks for the offer.. but no thanks.
When is she not in trouble?
Theoretically, yes! The four Stones form the beam and the Fifth Element is supposed to stand in the middle there, but... I don't have the reference book. I've never seen the Stones work!
Yes, of course, but... The Stones are shut! They have to be open for it to work.
What is?
The Supreme Being, the fifth element is here, in our parish!!! It's a miracle!!!
Yes. Of course..
Later, David! Later! There's not a minute to lose!
I'll help her, I promise, but I think you should tell me where the Stones are!
They are... with me...
Hey bud! Finger here.
I was talking to the cat.
You still pining for that two timing bitch. Forget her. There are a million women out there.
How many points you got left on your license?
In your dreams! See you tonight!
Leeloo..
It there's one thing I don't need advice on, it's how to drive.
When mankind comes to its senses. We will return.
Ma. If I'd won, I'd know about it. Someone would have notified me.
What mission?
Old tricks are the best tricks eh?
Why not?
Uh..you're welcome.
Not hard to find you...just follow the Chaos...
Learning language.
Yes! Now it's your turn! I learned your language, you have to learn mine!
Yes... you know there's a lot of differences between men women.
I'm so tired...
Exactly.
The last two messages I got?  The first one was from my wife telling me she was leaving! And the second was from my lawyer telling me he was leaving too... with my wife.
It's not that easy..we've never encountered anything like it before..you see normal human beings have 40 DNA memo groums..which is more than enough for any species to perpetuate itself..This one has 200,000.
There are no results from the chemical and molecular analysis as of yet, all the calibers are overshot..we're hoping a thermo nucleatic imaging..
Options.
Really? Maybe I can get you on my screen and see you at last!
Fine, just fine!  I'll have the 4 pieces you asked for any time now.  But it wasn't easy. My costs have tripled.
...I can't wait to be among you.
Honey, I'm not, please...
I understand.
I know.
I don't know.  I'm sorry...
You don't understand...
Don't...
Mrs. Christian.
She's all I've got.  She's the only witness.
I just talked to her.
What can I do for you today?
And they are?
Where are the women?
What are you... ?
Look, I don't know what this...
Put the gun down, take the handcuffs.  Handcuff yourself to the bed.
First things first.  You might want to watch this, Mr. Welles...
Call me Tom.
Why not go to the N.C.I.C. or N.C.M.E.C.?
Why don't they come to me?
Well, that's all I can do.  Sorry.
Eddie.
One million dollars, Dino.  How much did he tell you he had...
Don't bore me with that bullshit.
What do you want?
Where?  Show me where.
That's right, you just stood there and watched, because you "felt like it."  Almost makes you worse.
Of what sort?
None of this would be happening if you would have left it alone.  If you weren't digging up a girl who died six years ago.  A girl no one even remembers.
I'm asking.
You're a private eye.  Like Shaft.
Wake up, pops.  Your education begins tonight.
You can't sit there all day watching the parade of losers that comes into that place without going numb.  So what? Am I gonna go off and be a race car driver?  Go to Harvard?  Run for President?  What about you, pops?
Specialty product.
I'm trying to figure that out myself.  I have to see Machine without his mask.
I try to be.
He's a lawyer.  Please, sit, here...
I've been privileged to provide services for people I admire.
I'll do whatever I can to help.
Mostly.  That's where he started his empire building.  He was a good man.  Notorious as an eccentric, but that was something he cultivated.  He wanted to be legendary.
Do you want to tell me what you found?
No.
You've found missing persons before.
I'm here.
Send it to me through the post office like we arranged.  No return address.  You dug this up all by yourself?
Mrs. Christian, Tom Welles here.
I've made progress.  I'm in Manhattan.  Once a few more pieces fall into place, I'll drive to you and give you an update.
They hired you.  You're like, a private detective?
No.
Yes.
We were divorced by then.  Things fell apart... he was living with a friend...
I have to tell you something.  It won't be easy for you to hear.  It's about your daughter... Mary Anne...  When I... when I was there with you, her diary, in your attic, in silverware.  If you read it, you'll know what I'm telling you is true...
Who is this... ?
Why... why are you doing this to me... ?
Yeah, I know the spiel.  If you could bag it, I'll be on my way, thank you.
Kristen...
I gotta get to the library before it closes.  Killer physics test.
You're his sister, right?
Tell him I was looking for him, okay?  I'm Dan.
It was no suicide.  It was not an accident.  It was Freddy, and he's coming back for seconds, thirds, and fourths.
The story is, the deaths you can't argue with.
Something's wrong here.  It feels like...
Debbie.  She's gone.  I've...collected her, like the others.
Save it for later.  Come on!
Well Mom, I'll tell ya, when two of your friends die the same day, you let me know what it does to your appetite.
Avoid-all-contact-day.
I though Freddy was just an old town story.
Yeah.  I guess so... What happened?
Huh?
Come on downstairs.  He won't hurt you. He needs us both.
No.  Well, not exactly...it's that...I felt like I wasn't in control.  For the first time since...all that.  I'm scared.
Yeah...I guess.
No, I'm not.  I sort of hope it's a boy. Be nice to have a boy playing in the house again.
No, the Dan part was nice...
Alice, it's no dream.  I'm sorry...Dan's dead.
Mark knows I'm not crazy.  Ask him to show you his hands.
Goddamn it, Yvonne!  You don't just run away from this guy!  He finds you in your dreams.
That's the only reason you're alive...
Yeah...So that's him.  And you're not crazy.
We've got to go to the asylum and find her body.  Mark said her soul's trapped with it -- that's why she can't come to me.  It must be!
That's why it's my fault Dan's dead.
Mark!
My baby!
I'm going to see what else I can find out about Mr. Fred Krueger
But I've seen her grave.
Naah, I'm done.  Got to be on shift in a couple hours.  Aren't you going in?
Two hours a day, six days a week.
Faint.
Mark...
Stick around, please?
He invited me to his house last night.
Dead?  Matter of fact, he's much better. He's left the hospital.
I'd sooner swim!
But if they <u>do</u>?
A lot of people think like that.
Have you ever talked to Carl - tried to see his side?
Go back and tell Dr. Neilsen. Have him report to the Skipper.
Strange you didn't hear it. OMIT 274F
Yes, Griff?
Radiation level...constantly rising...
Anything ---
I did go.  Just back.  Reef, these are a couple of our passengers - Sir Ian Hunt, and Dr. Clifford Kent.  My exec, Commander Richard Holloway.
Huh?
It's the screws, Skipper.  At our declination angle, running in reverse, they're pulling the Shark <u>and</u> Cyclops right to the bottom.
Nothing we can do, now.
Come where?
Point of view is everything. To us, <u>your</u> form of life is ugly as we appear to you.
Your friend was to remain where he was!
That's why no water leaked inside when we rammed you?
The pattern.  Each incident occurred almost precisely a thousand statute miles from the Pole.  A line through the points of occurrence makes almost a complete circle...
Or, perhaps, until he gets us?
All right - go to it.
Been putting my files into it. You take sugar and milk?
This is maybe worse than you and I are used to.  What I'm talking about, I'm talking about murder. Among other things.
Evan Twombley, the union boss who got shot. Somebody murdered him.
Has anybody offered to buy it?
Just tell me when you'll have it fixed.
He can't fire me. LaRiviere already did that this morning.
It would help if you were married, if there was someone at home while you work.
That was me.
You think so.
What happened?
Some job. Here, have a hit. Don't be such a hardass. I know you got problems, but everybody's got problems. 
The ambulance guys lugged him up.
Why don't you quit now, you want out so bad?
I don't care. They're out.
Do what?
Break stuff?
It's not funny now. I'm a cop and I gotta listen to all the complaints people make. I'm not a kid anymore. You change.
What are you talking about?
It's stupid.
No.
I called Mommy.
I know.
Nope. Not anymore. I'm nothing anymore.
I want to go home.
Got here just in time. Go ahead. Jump in line. Maybe you'll win a prize.
At the school crossing. In his BMW. Coulda hurt some kids. I'm gonna bust his ass.
You mean Twombley?
So?
Mel's doing some business with me. It's nice to do favors for people you do business with. He was in a hurry. No big deal.
Don't light that in here. I'm allergic.
Oh, Jesus, lay off, will you? It looks like you've won this fucking round already, so lay off a little, for Christ's sake.
I know who it is.
Yeah.
Yeah.
There's something funny about that shooting. There's lots funny about it, actually.
Jack wouldn't kill for it. Besides, who would pay him?
The Mafia hire Jack Hewitt?
Don't you think it's proper for a fella to introduce his girl to his parents?
How?
Wade.
How's that?
Oh, no. No, it's a... it's a traffic thing. No big deal.
You be careful of that little bastard. He's dying to get in your pants, you know.
Jack?
It's called a grilled cheese sandwich, you dub.
Bang!
Wade?
He was scheduled to testify for a committee investigating organized crime in New England and the construction business.
You think Jack shot him?
How was she?
What happened?
No, no, I haven't. Not really. I've growled a little, but I haven't bit.
No thanks. I don't drink.
That it wasn't an accident.
They wouldn't deal with a guy like Jack. Who else benefits if Twombley is suddenly dead?
A hunting accident is perfect.
Alice...
Your father never means to be so...
Yes dear?
Okay, it's on. We've got some indicator lights here.
I'm doing what I can.
Lemme take a look.
I prefered the terrorists.
Goddamn right I did.  I asked for a tough-as-nails speech and you gave me diplomatic bullshit.  What's the point in having a speech if I have to ad-lib?
Does your office have anything to add, Mr. Dean?
Like any good poker player, they're checking over their hand seeing which cards to play and which to discard.
Because it is my duty.
Ga get it.
why did they do that?
No! If we land this plane anywhere else, we will end up another Entebe.  The Americans built a super plane that flies through mushroom cloud, evades missiles and...  refuels in mid-air. Call the White House.
Romeo Tango Zulu, copy One the television, graphics of the First Family against the Presidential Seal.
Stand by.
The President and I were delighted that we could accommodate you.  Now if you're all cleared?  You can follow me then.
This is a remarkable aircraft.
I know he left you behind.
Your husband is a coward. He sends soldiers half-way around the world to steal a man from his home in the middle of the night.
Yes
Pity. Mr. Gibbs.
We can't jump from here or at this speed. But if we could get a message out - tell the refueling plane...
Flying the plane.
Excuse me?
Actually, sir, you could be that someone.
You know my policy. We don't negotiate with terrorists. If we start now, all of America becomes a target.
This is a crime bill, Shep.  Killing a couple ducks won't get it through committee.  Besides, Shep, I told you...  I don't shoot babies and I don't kiss guns.
We'll just say it was in bad taste.
Yes, sir.
Sir...
Iraq? Shep, you're fired.
I told you, leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys down...
Some southern plantation owner falls in love with this poor...
Dunn.
Accelerators down.
Sir?
Ask Simon.
You're as bad as the rest of them, Elaine!  It's all here in the design specifications!  Look!  It's all here!
Ted, I loved you and I'll always love you. But I need Simon.  He's stable.  He's a good provider.  I want that at this stage of the game, Ted.  He might have his faults, but Simon doesn't know the meaning of the word fear and I need that in a man.
Ted!
Ted, please be careful.
I just want you to know, I love you Ted and always will.
Sit down, Elaine.  If this bomb trick works we just might make it.  Simon was a fool to eject now.
The sun will heat that thing to over 450 degrees within seconds.  He'll roast like a pig on a spit.
Kramer, the WORP control handle just came off in my hand.
The human brain is a highly complex organ, Elaine, perhaps the most complex next to the bladder.  Let me show you.  Ted's problem is in this area.  This area, this area, here, here, here, under here, here...
But, darling, they've offered me a chance to head up the computer analysis division for the Jupiter probe.
I'm so excited, Simon.
Don't be too long.
Roger.
We're computer locked and the manual navigation unit is down.
Go ahead.
We'll have to check, Jimmy.  It's a pretty long trip to Mercury.
It's going to be terrific.  A whole new world, new kids to play with.
No more kids yelling, 'Your old man's a thieving rapist'?
Sure.
Let's go, Daddy.  We have to check in.  He was never appreciated at the Institute.
Do you have an appointment, sir?
Don't try to stop me!
I opened this panel and a vacuum cleaner hit me.
We were in love but I'm not sure I know what love is anymore.
I just wish it was that simple.  We really were in love.  You know how it is when you laugh all the time.
No. I'm from Washington, D.C. I'm a lobbyist for the Small Businessmen's Assocation.
No. I'm all alone.
Oh, yes. Come in, Paul. Rex will be right out.
Shep, no! I'll bet you have exciting things happen all the time down there.
I <u>am</u> serious, and don't call me Shirley! What flying experience have you had?
Let's see. Those are the flaps, that's the thrust, this must turn on the landing lights.
Surely there must be something you can do.
No.
I just don't want to go over it any more.
Seven. Lieutenant Zipp died this morning. Ted, Doctor Sandler says you'll be out in a week. Isn't that wonderful?
Ted, I don't want to stay here. It's time for us to go back home -- to the plans we made before the war.
It's a damn good thing you don't know how much he hates your guts.
Who wants to be first?
You promise you'll write.
Oh, Bill, I'll keep it. I'll keep it with me all the time.
Yes, Captain?
You are now eight miles from the airport. Turn right to a heading of zero eight niner, throttle back slightly and begin to lose altitude to fifteen hundred feet.
Watch your altitude, Striker. It's too erratic. You can't come straight in. You've got enough fuel left for two hours flying. You've got to stay up there 'til we get a break in the weather.
I think you're the greatest. But my Dad says you don't work hard enough on defense.
...and that lots of times you don't even run down court.
I will, but Jim won't.
No. No thank you.
The cockpit? What is it?
Does that cost extra or you throw them in?
Your voice is saying no, but your body is saying yes.
You ever try to make a case in Slagtown?  The list of Newcomer informants is about as long as the list of Mexican war heroes...
Sergeant... Detective.  I wasn't aware there were any Newcomers at the rank of Detective yet.
There was no wallet... but he was still wearing a watch and two rings.
Possibly.  Good.  Well, would you be willing to accept the theory, George, that... possibly... by examining the evidence from one case we might shed some small ray of light on the other?  Does that sound unreasonable to you?
Why the hell--?!  Great, fine.  You talk to the wife.
Uh, Matthew...
Stay back!  I'm okay.
In the camps, we were lodged four to a room.  The selection process was entirely random.  We did not get to stay with our friends... or families...
Thank you.
... It is called ss'jabroka'.  To us it is a potent narcotic.
We all did.
Stay out of this, Matthew.  Tell me where the drug has been taken or I will crush your lungs against this wall.
The fifty kilos, Matthew.  I have to find it.  I can't let it get out on the street.
It'd be for your own good.  I think you'd be better off with a partner who's a little more... by the book.  ... Still, I gotta tell you, George, for a quiet guy, you're sure hell on wheels once you get going.  I'd kinda hate to miss your next two days as a detective.
There!  Go back.  Down that side street.
No he's not.  Not if he overdosed on the drug.  Massive amounts trigger a... a change.  Your body functions seize up, you appear to be dead, but it's really a state of incubation.  When you emerge you're...
Yes it is.  Thirty-five percent pure Methane gas in there.  I don't know how these fellas do it.
Ss'kya'ta'.
Come on.  You got nothin' better to do, cushy county job like yours.
Fedorchuk couldn't find his ass with his hands in his back pockets.
Yeah.
Lucky nothing.  I had to empty my damn gun into him.
Looking for some foreign compound in the blood of that alien you dropped the other day.
I got him.  Don't get pinned.
Christ.  I never saw such a buncha old women.  You want me to fetch your slippers, Hudson?
Now let me get this straight. The aliens paralyzed the colonists, carried them over there, cocooned them to be hosts for more of those...
Well, the queen is always physically larger then the others.  A termite queen's abdomen is so bloated with eggs that it can't move at all.  It is fed and tended by drone workers, defended by the warriors.  She is the center of their lives, quite literally the  mother of their society.
I'm afraid so.  The crash did too much damage.  The overload is inevitable, at this point.
Uh-hunh.  One of thirty or so, all over the planet.  They're completely automated.  We manufacture them, by the way.
Bullshit!
Corporal Hicks!?
Sorry to disappoint you.
We're trained to deal with these kinds of situations.
Shit.  Apone, collect magazines from everybody.  We can't have any firing in there.
Thirty-eight...simulated.
The structure seems intact.  They have power.
Apone...where are your people? Anybody in D-Block?
So...then the fusion containment shuts down.
Shut up.  Just shut up!
They're but off!  Do something!
All right, I guess.  One hell of a hangover.  Look, Ripley... I...
Hudson, Sir.  He's Hicks.
Is this going to be a stand-up fight, Sir, on another bug-hunt?
How do I get out of this chicken-shit outfit?
Aye-firmative.
We gotta figure on them getting into the complex.
Can't tell.  Lots.  D gun's down to twenty.  Ten.  It's out.
Oh, God.  Jesus.  This ain't happening.
Uh, what's next?
How?  The transmitter was on the APC.  It's wasted.
Think of what?  We're fucked.
How long have I been on Gateway station?
No.. I've slept enough.
You're really something, ace.
I don't want to...I have scary dreams.
You mean dead.
I'll be right in the other room, Newt.  And look...I can see you on that camera right up there.
Sixty, maybe seventy families.
Then that would be eating and drinking I'd live like a Prince without thinking. The wisdom of old would be mine - A woman's much better than wine! Then that would be eating and drinking! The wisdom of old would be mine - A woman's much better than wine. She's much better than wine! She's much better than wine!
At present the girls only peck me. Their cruelty surely will wreck me. But one little beak in my own, And I'll up to heaven be flown! At present the girls only peck me. But one little beak in my own, And I'll up to heaven be flown. Up to heaven be flown! Up to heaven be flown!
Certainly!
Indeed.
A brothel.
Well, what does it matter to you?
You were sublime.
I'm so relieved.
What??
Oh sir, yes! He's about to make the worst mistake of his life. Some little Viennese slut is trying to trick him into marriage. I know my son. He is too simple to see the trap - and there is no one there who really cares for him.
Yes, sir, that's the truth. But don't blame him. The fault is mine. I was too indulgent with him. But not again. Never again, I promise! I implore you - let me bring him back here. I'll make him give his word to serve you faithfully.
Why do I have to be humiliated in front of my guests by one of my own servants?
How much provocation am I to endure from you? The more license I allow you, the more you take.
Who the devil are you? What do you want?
I want to go!
Go ahead, tell him. Tell them all. They won't understand you anyway.
Why? People fart backwards.
No, no. Say it backwards, shit-wit. Sra-I'm-sick Say it backwards!
Oh, leave me alone.
Shut up! Just shut up! I don't need them.
I love you! I love you!
Stop it, Wolfi. I look dreadful. Welcome to our house, Herr Mozart.
Wolfi! Your father is dead.
Your father is dead.
Stanzi-manzi, I'll put it in your hand!
Madame. How can I help you?
He's terribly busy, sir.
No, sir. This is my own idea.
No. I was assisting him. He asked me.
Oh yes, and who are you? He's worked for Kings. For the Emperor.  Who are you?
Adorable!
Behold!
Gertrude!
Yes. He is a little strange.
It's just a trifle, of course.
Yes?
And the result satisfies.
Majesty, I did. Believe me, it was a most agonizing. decision. But finally, I simply could not recommend Herr Mozart.
Did we vote in the end for German or Italian?
Well, Majesty, it is only a comedy.
I have no idea.
I will.
Am I not welcome?
No one calls you that.
I will, sir.
Really? What is it he's writing?
In there, sir.
I'm leaving. I'm not working there anymore. I'm scared!
Here, in his stomach. They bend him right over.
Please don't ask me to go back again. I'm frightened! I'm very, very frightened.
My name is Lorl, sir. I'm a maidservant. I was asked to come here and offer my services to you.
Sublime! Utterly sublime!
I'd like to try them someday. I'm not sure I'd be much good at it.
Why not?
Madame.
Is my pupil still anxious to learn the art of music?
Really? Perhaps your dear wife might care to profit from my instruction?
Ah, how exciting! Tell me more.
I don't know. They say I've got to re-write the opera, but it's perfect as it is. I can't rewrite what's perfect. Can't you talk to him?
Thank you! Oh, thank you.
I know; it's outrageous. Still, if the public doesn't like one's work one has to accept the fact gracefully.
You're so good to me. Truly. Thank you.
This is only a vaudeville.
The doctor thinks I am. But -
So now - A minor. Suddenly.
I think so.
First bassoon and tenor trombone - what?
I - I don't think you have, Herr Director. Not yet. I mean, it's quite n - Of course, I'll show it to you immediately.
Exactly.
Taking out what you should never have put in.
Mozart, you are not the only composer in Vienna.
Elevated? What does that mean? Elevated! The only thing a man should elevate is - oh, excuse me. I'm sorry. I'm stupid. But I am fed up to the teeth with elevated things! Old dead legends! How can we go on forever writing about gods and legends?
You tried to take your life. You do remember that, don't you?
My son, there is something dreadful on your soul. Unburden it to me. I'm here only for you. Please talk to me.
Here in Vienna.
God's ways are not yours. And you are not here to question Him. Offer him the salt of penitence. He will give you back the bread of eternal life. He is all merciful. That is all you need to know.
I poisoned his life.
Well done, Sire!
I agree, Baron.
Oh, yes. He's just exhausted. He became dizzy, that's all. We should let him rest.
Oh, I don't mean running about on all fours and howling at the moon. But in such a deranged state he could harm himself, or perhaps others.
The zoo? Is he rational?
Yes, Doctor.
He's fine. We'll come right over.
No, a cab will be faster.
What?
Yes?
How is that?
Call me Alex.
It's okay. I want to talk to you.
That's not really a very proper question.
Will you think about it?
Not just a patient -- me.
Forgive me, I'm trying to cheer myself up and an affair with a beautiful nurse seemed like just the thing to do it.
Your dead friend Jack?
I would think so.
Charming.
There is only one bed.
It's nice to see you.
David, let's go now.
No.
No.
No.
No!
Yes, I should think. He called out just now.
Why on earth do you say that?
Has he been refusing food?
Yes, Mrs. Hobbs.
You did, did you?
Shakespeare was French! The Queen Mother sucks cocks in hell! Shit! Fuck! Piss!
Get your fucking hands off me! What the hell is going on here?
You've been unconscious since you were brought in two weeks ago.
Now we've just given you a pretty strong sedative, so try to get some rest now. Miss Price will see to your needs. Rest now.
So they said.
In time I'm sure it will all come back to you.
Sure, as a kid. But never so real. Never so bizarre.
Yes.
I don't know.
If you don't stop, I'm going to kill you.
It's a five-pointed star.
You ask them.
I see. You want me to ask these people if they're burning candles to ward off monsters.
What do you mean? I'm starving.
Come on, I'm freezing.
I don't know. Come on.
A sheep dog or something. Turn slowly and let's walk away.
Are you going to help me up?
This is too much. I can't handle this.
I can't stand it.
I was murdered, an unnatural death, and now I walk the earth in limbo until the werewolf's curse is lifted.
The wolf's bloodline must be severed. The last remaining werewolf must be destroyed.
Stop it, Jack.
What do you think?
You don't have to say anything.
Thank you.
If you did it wrong, it would be painful. You'd choke to death.
Come in, come in. Please sit. Some tea?
Roger Mathison, Doctor.
Oh, that's been there for two hundred years. We were going to paint it out, but it's traditional, so we left it.
We've got spirits and beer. If it's something hot you want, you can have tea.
I'd like some tea, please.
You here again? What do you want?
Matt?
Aw, nerts!
Yeah.
Gentlemen, you notice Mr. Dickson refuses to consider our wishes. He refuses an offer to merge with the New York Trust - the only thing that will put this bank on safe ground. He insists upon running a bank on so flimsy a thing as . . . as faith!
So, that's it, eh? You've waited a long time for this chance, haven't you?  Well, I'm not going to resign now - or ever.
I can't? You just wait and see. If that run doesn't stop within the next hour, I'll shut the doors. You know what that means? The bank examiner will step in tomorrow. You'll be forced to liquidate. I'll insist upon it. The depositors will be paid one hundred cents on the dollar. What's left you gentlemen can have. But I'll guarantee there won't be enough to pay your next month's garage bill.
We've been waiting fifteen minutes-
Somebody must be in good humor. He was humming "Mother Machree."
Gambling - I owed them a lot of money. Last week I lost over fifty thousand dollars!
Nothing, nothing, Mr. Dickson. Don't pay any attention to me. I don't know what I'm saying.
Get out, get out!
I'm sorry, Dude, but-I-
You? No, you'll be all right, so long as you establish an alibi for tonight.
Well, you can. You always could.
Well, aren't you going to invite me?
Don't you know I've been crazy about you for years?
I'm not afraid of you. You haven't got a moustache!
I guess I have said enough  I'm just wasting my breath talking to you.
John, how's your wife this morning?
Of course, let them in! You're late now.
Tomorrow night?
Last night? Er - why - uh, last night . . .
Ummm. Stalling, eh?  Anything new?
Now don't you worry about it.
Oh, no! It's not for you. You're only going to get married. Mrs. Dickson and I are going to go on the honeymoon.
Helen, I'm going to Philadelphia, just as soon as the bank closes. Make all the arrangements, will you?
Ah, Mrs. Pembroke. I spoke to Mr. Schaffer at the Guaranty. He's going to take care of that mortgage for you . . .
Sure, I think it's swell.
You're protecting somebody.
Why wouldn't you tell me where you were last night?
Were you in Cluett's apartment?
Was Mrs. Dickson there?
Wait a minute. Answer my question. Was Mrs. Dickson there?
But I haven't . . .
No wonder he didn't want to mention her name.
Come here, honey!
Oh, is that so?
Well, he was making love to her.
Yeah.  I got an idea. Come on, let's get to a telephone.
What time was it, Mrs. Halligan?
Yes.
Well, about - uh - eleven o'clock.
It's still taking too long. The people used to snap to.
Leave me alone, Bob.
Best damn plan I heard all war.
Hey!
You heard me, Jesse. You know how crazy I get!
I could use the walk.
There's Yankees back there. Lot's of 'em.
After all you did on our farm?  You miss it, don't you Jesse?
It was exciting.
Yeah.
Perfect, Cole.
Yep.
Now the one time one of us comes up with an idea --
That's it.
Missed you too, cousin.
We didn't. Zerelda did. Turns out your wife makes a hell of an outlaw.
You pay me to find you Bluecoats. There they are.
Must be a garrison in town. We're in occupied territory, boys.
Shakespeare.  He's European.
Of course!  Uh, sir?
The District Marshall
You're right, sir.
On account of we're robbing it.
Died a hero.
I'm upset too, Zee, but Jesse and Cole know what they're doing. I'm sure they won't press their luck.
Mm-hmm.
Maybe, maybe...
What do you think?
Don't care.
Fine. How'd it go out here?
And that's why you both lead the gang. Two of you went into that bank together, right?
A better life than the one you could have had with Zee?
Jim was old enough...
See you soon. Oh, and I appreciate the distraction back there.
He's a good Christian and he killed Yankees. Jesus told me that made him an all right boy.
Boys?
If there's anything we can do for you, Dr. Mimms. We want to help.
What you do to me is unfair. The teasing, I mean.
Frank and me have to go away for a while.
Stop it. This is just sad.
So I'll get a fair trial in front of a jury bought off by Thaddeus Rains?
Pity.
You had all those cattle there, so I'd think the extra men were in town from the cattle drive?
I figured.
Fair enough.
Right here in church?
Yeah. Hey, are you drinking whisky? You're too young to be drinking whisky.
You do that.
You're gonna tell her when you're resting up in bed with her, Jimmy.
Yes, but just so I could find out who you were.
I hope I'm not being too forward.
I just though you were awful cute.
I'm doing you folks a favor --
NO! It is NOT my pleasure to have to leave my board room to come to this godforsaken piece of dirt to discover why in the name of all that is holy you cannot seem to evict a few simple farmers from their PATHETIC LITTLE MUDHOLES so that I may build the GREATEST railroad that this country has ever seen!
Two weeks ago, we managed to arrange to have the Army hang one of the local farmers.
Unfortunately not, sir. A gang of local thugs managed to rescue him from the gallows. Not only has this inspired resistance from the other farmers, the redoubtable Mr. Alan Pinkerton was seriously injured during the incident.
A further impediment is that the Army garrison has been ordered to move on from Liberty. We will no longer have that particular stick with which to threaten the farmers.
I'm losing millions of dollars and months of time while you play chess with these farmers!
Can you put men at all four?
Stop it. I'm...
Pumpkin?
Pumpkin you're dating the biggest dickweed in New York.
Nice?
The question is do you like it, Courtney? And will you blow off a fucking phone call from your sad excuse for a boyfriend to eat there tonight.
Champagne on the rocks. Oh-could I have that with a twist? She starts to sink back in her chair and Bateman leans over and pulls her back up.
Because you have to leave half an inch at the tip -  to catch the force of the ejaculate! BATEMAN I'm getting out of here. Where's your lithium?
Oh God, just get it over with.
I'm not supposed to.  But I can make an exception.
Alright.
My friend told me I should maybe even get a lawyer.
Do...what.
Oh God, Patrick. Why Price? Price?
Everybody has a great body now.
I think, Evelyn, that we've...lost touch.
Yes, I am.
I have to return some videotapes.
Is that all you ever have to contribute, Van Patten? "What about fucking dinner?"
What exactly do you mean?
Davis. I'm not one to bad-mouth anyone, your joke was amusing. But come on, man, you had one fatal flaw: Bateman's such a dork, such a boring, spineless lightweight, that I couldn't fully appreciate it. I wasn't fooled for a second. Now, if you'd said Price, or McDermott...Otherwise, it was amusing. Now, let's have lunch or dinner or something. Hilarious, Davis. A killer.
Oh Christ. He can barely pick up an escort girl, let alone...what was it you said he did to her?
Where are you going?
It looks that way, doesn't it?
Like what?
Two at nine? Perfect.
I occasionally box with Ricky at the Harvard Club. Anyone else?
Yes, sir.
Come on, you're prettier than that.
Jean, do you feel...fulfilled? I mean, in your life?
Well, most guys I know who work in mergers and acquisitions don't really like it.
Next Saturday?
If you had an American Express card she'd give you a blowjob.  Listen, this girl worked in a tanning salon, need I say more?...What do you do?
Why would I?
No.
No! I'm not a lesbian. Why do you think I'd be into that?
Hi. Pat Bateman. Nice to meet you.
Who do you ask?
He led what I suppose was an orderly life. He... ate a balanced diet.
Hang...out?
Do you have any witnesses or fingerprints?
Oh.
Yikes! No. Paul wasn't into that. He followed a balanced diet and-
It's just strange.  One day someone's walking around, going to work, alive, and then...
Isn't the Four Seasons a little far uptown? I mean aren't you going to be late?
Yeah, gone into rehab. Shame.  Is he a suspect?
Absolutely. I'm with you on that one.
Not a big music fan, eh?
And?
So who was he with?
It's cold out, too, isn't it?
I'm hungry.
What am I gonna do?
You re so kind, mister. You're kind. You're a kind man. I can tell.
Please...I don know what to do. I'm so cold.
Oh yes. I'm very lucky.
We should've gone to Dorsia. I could've gotten us a table.
Two-hundred-and-fifty. Very reasonable. Let's leave a big tip, shall we? My place hr a nightcap?
Come on, you dumb son of a bitch.  I've got a preview of the Barneys catalogue and a bottle of Absolut waiting for us.
'Gonna wait outside.
You know what he's like. He just wants to work on stuff that's cool.
If he's really a bully, he won't cop to it, anyway.
No way. You have this -- destiny.
Prob'ly waiting by the phone for Outpost to call. We'll leave it for him?
That's what I need to ask you.  You know you can't keep anything from me.
I know, I know.
Nobody does work like this on-line. It's in your PC, or in a mainframe. Self-contained. They'd have to be, like, watching people. Physically.  Oh Jesus.
Nothing.
...Different?
Okay, yeah. I did something naughty... There's this amazing Comix store in Seattle.  To tell you the truth, I did it once or twice at Stanford. 'Guess I can't keep anything from you...
He has thousands of employees, Milo --
Look at me! I'm gonna change.
I know you. You're gonna run back to work right after dinner. I want my kiss now.
...It's -- Milo, isn't it?
Give me two seconds with Lacy here?  Go on in, I won't be a moment.
I am. I am, sir.
It was racially motivated. He's Chinese. He was. And... I know sometimes the FBI gets involved with that. Don't they?
I -- just wanna help bring these guys to justice. They're neo-Nazis.
And the kid who wrote Skywire -- then gave it away? They're calling him the digital Robin Hood.
Oh hi.
He's pretty tight with his family.
Would you like a Coke or something?
There's a rumor going around, maybe you've heard it.
I do!
...Do I?
Don't spend too much time searching. You ever vetted somebody's old code before?  It's a different skill. Stay close to the surface. The best-hidden secrets are in plain sight. You know the best place to hide a leaf, right?  In a tree.
The wrong place?
You look a little tired.
'Have a look?
Don't be so hard on yourself. With a brain like yours, you could connive with the best of 'em I bet.
I do know, Gary. I feel the same way. I thought I was coming here for a job. But it's meant a lot more.
There may be a little less trust after your outburst.
Let's go.
You do?
You are naive. Look at your employment contract: you can't work anywhere else in this field for at least few years.  Not that I don't miss you.
He was on the verge of something, too. He was gonna show us the next day. He said "The answer's not in the box, it's in the band." Know what it means?
Man, could he write code. Totally elegant. He had his own style.
I'm calling Gary.
I launched Skywire. Just pray the last set of coordinates Milo sent me connected us to Gary's satellite.
You're famous around here.
No, I know what you mean. I used to spend my life wishing people could be like computers. Least they make sense. Sometimes you think they've betrayed you. Like a person would. But then you see, no, you just missed a step. You can go back and make it all work.
No. Please.
They're already watching you. If they had to, they'd give him this drug that mimics an alcoholic blackout. He'd wake up not even remembering his "act of revenge."
Certainly not at my happy home.
It's a standard GUI. Once I've got a concept, it's maybe three day's work.
You mean -- break in?
Milo? Shrot suspects somebody broke into #21. I was in his office when he was reviewing the card readouts.
Yeah, that's old, in a tree.
He suspects I know something. I think he was sort of -- explaining himself to me, in case I do.  We have to go in tonight. I'm two hours from a Beta version.  But I've gotta go home for an hour.
What?
Jesus, Teddy.
She's a programmer?
Not much. Glorified cherry bomb. Right by the civil defense sign? Some geek's idea of irony. I been saying we need a camera in this hall.
Unless it's a diversion. Milo's in my office. He was tailgating, so I --
I thought you'd quit while you were ahead.
Sak-i it to me!
That's very clever. Do you know any other poems?
Hey, how are you?
Oh, and Austin...
You might also experience a slight fever, dry mouth, and flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation. Austin, this is Commander Gilmour, Strategic Command, and General Borschevsky, Russian Intelligence.
Let me remind you that because of the unfreezing process you might experience flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation.
What's the other thing you're scared of?
Good God, and underground missile. We've long feared such a development.
Damn it, man! You're talking about my mother!
I think if everyone were honest, they'd confess that the lady looks exactly like a man in drag.
Really? Let me ask you this. What is love?
No, Mr. Powers, I expect them to die. Even after they pay me the money, I'm still going to melt all the cities of the world with hot magma.  All right, guard, begin the unnecessarily Slow-Moving Dipping Mechanism.
Well done, Mr. Powers. We're not so different, you and I. It's true, you're British, and I'm Belgian. You have a full head of hair, mine is slightly receding. You're thin, I'm about forty pounds overweight. OK, we are different, I'm not making a very good point. However, isn't it ironic, Mr. Powers, that the very things you stand for-- swinging, free love, parties, distrust of authority- are all now, in the Nineties, considered to be... evil? Maybe we have more in common than you care to admit.
Really, there's nothing more pathetic than an aging hipster.
Not really. Kill the little bastard. See what I care.
Mr. Powers, please. I know that you must be a little confused, but we have a very serious situation at hand. I would appreciate it if you'd concentrate on our mission and give your libido a rest.
No, actually. I don't know how to put this really. Well, there have been fabulous advances in the field of dentistry.
No worries, luv. We'll just give Basil a tinkle on the telling bone...
Well they should, filthy beggars, they go from port to port.  Alotta meant nothing to me.
Thirty years of political and social upheaval. The fall of the Berlin wall, a female Prime Minister of England, the abolishment of Apartheid, a fascinating tapestry of human strum und drang.
Yes, act naturally and we'll split this scene the way we came in, Vanessa.
Shut up.
Likewise.
I believe you, Austin. Let's go.
Are you crazy?
That's fab, because I love you, too, Vanessa.
I'm telling you, baby, that's not mine.
I don't even know what this is. This sort of thing ain't my bag, baby.
Here, have a piece of gum.
Hey! Wait a minute, that's my last piece of gum.
Let this be a reminder to you all that this organization will not tolerate failure.
Someone help me! I'm still alive, only I'm very badly burned.
Ya wohl-- I mean, yes wohl, Herr Doctor. I have created the ultimate weapon to defeat Austin Powers. Bring on the Fembots!
Dr. Evil?
Hello, Scott. I'm your father, Dr. Evil.  I have a son! I have a son! Everyone, I have a son!  Someday, Scott, this will all be yours.
Not me.
No. Maybe, like, work in a petting zoo or something.
Well, me and a buddy went to the video arcade in town and, like, they don't speak English right, and so my buddy gets into a fight, and he goes 'hey, quit hassling me cause I don't speak French or whatever', and the other guy goes something in Paris talk, and I go 'um, just back off' and he goes 'get out' and I go 'make me'.
Why are you feeding him? Why don't you just kill him?
People have to tell me these things. I've been frozen for thirty years, throw me a bone here.  OK, no problem. Here's my second plan. Back in the Sixties I had a weather changing machine that was in essence a sophisticated heat beam which we called a "laser."  Using this laser, we punch a hole in the protective layer around the Earth, which we scientists call the "Ozone Layer." Slowly but surely, ultraviolet rays would pour in, increasing the risk of skin cancer. That is, unless the world pays us a hefty ransom.
Just wait. Once Austin gets you in his charms, it's impossible to get out.
Of course not. I was married to your father.
Austin is very charming, very debonair. He's handsome, witty, has a knowledge of fine wines, sophisticated, a world-renowned photographer. Women want him, men want to be him. He's a lover of love-- every bit an International Man of Mystery.
I don't know. I was thinking, maybe I'd be a vet or something, cause I like animals and stuff.
No need. I'll call again.
... love...
Ah, but you haven't see the real me. Watch closely ...
You don't get rain like you used to in England. A good shower that's the ticket. Stiffens resolve, puckers the spirit, quells the namby-pamby in a man.
Impossible?
As you see.
To find out who killed my husband.
Thank you, Steed.
Thanks, Valentine ...
Darling Emma -- yes, we:  the true genius behind the Prospero Project ...
You killed my husband.
Ring?
Chaos. Transport paralysis. Crop failure.  Economic disaster. Frostbite or sunburn ... on a massive scale. You've seen a few samples...
One very small thing. A diamond 'cyclone' chip. A thousand times more information on a fraction of the size. If I possess that, my powers would be unlimited. My dear half-brother was developing it. But he suspected sabotage. He gave the chip to ... you, 'Mrs.' Peel. I want you. But also your ring.
So what was all this -- some sort of test?
We're not here to talk about the weather, surely.
A Gentleman has to have a code. This is part of mine. A uniform. Think of it as my suit of shining armor.
As per mother's instructions.
I mean your man Trubshaw.  Your bullet-proof waistcoat.  I thought you were just overdressed.
Very good, Steed ...
Is that written in his shoe?
Sounds as if someone's hijacked your research.
Barely.
Here's the one that broke the camel's back.
I expect that's for you to know and me to find out ...
Orders.
Always.  Except ...
Keeping a stiff upper lip?
What kept you?
Must be. Trubshaw's busy. I'll send Mother ...
Surveillance? By whom?
Let me guess:  Wonderland Weather.
So you say ...
You're getting yourself into terrible trouble, my son. Weather's turning very nasty -- and so am I.
Valentine Peel. I see you've gone back to using your original face.
If you say so.
Rick's got an important announcement to make.
Okay... This is it... I'm getting married.
Yeah, man, he's got us a great room at the hotel and lots of chicks.
What time are we supposed to get to the hotel?
He's gonna hurt you, Debbie. He'll never be true to you the way I would.
Oh, come on, just a little.
Gee, guys, what should I do? The car or Debbie?
Maybe it had something to do.
Yes I did.
Keep me informed.
Sorry, I can't hear you. Some pin head's yelling...  Shut up, I'm talking here.  Now look, I want you to go back and I don't care what you do. Stop that marriage.
1002.
Over here, Deb... in the Smokehouse.
You know, when you dumped me for that wimp, I thought, Cole, she'll be back. God wants the two of you to be together, and sure enough...
Cole, I'm sorry, I...
But a fabulous cook.
Want to hear something great? Bobbie and Phoebe are throwing me a shower. It's really gonna be fun.
It looks awful.
About what?
Good...
Debbie, I'm telling you, I didn't do anything, hardly.
You don't believe me? Okay, fine.
Yes...
Yeah.
Look, girls -- I'll stay behind and hold them off. The rest of you break for it!
Great, Mom.
Quiet, Mother.
I think I screwed that one once.
Let's see your bread.
What are you talking about, asshole?
What are you...
Why?
That's more like it.
Gary, you're quite an animal.
Let's have a toast.
I'm going to see what the hell happened.
Screw that.
Yes.
Rick, I really think I'm in love.
I want women.
Sold. 45 minutes. No problem.
Milt?
Naw, two on a Quaalude... bad luck.
I'm trying to slash my wrists.
Ha, ha, ha.
Your attention, please. May I be the first to say, It's a raid!
Rick, I want to cut through the b.s.
Good. I think you're an asshole. No, let me correct that, an immature asshole. Which is fine, except you're marrying my daughter and I'm afraid my grandchildren are going to be little assholes.
First, you're a slob. You have to dress for success. Second, your outlook on life...
Rick!
No sob story is going to change my mind.
You can tell a man by his friends.
No, Brett, I...
I'm separated.
Of course.
She probably had sex scheduled for 12:30. O'Neill, let's pick up the guys for a drink... I have major news to announce.
So long, Father.
If I'm not out in a half hour, send for the paramedics.
Take care.
I'm saved. Let's party!
Nah, not yet. Look, you're my older brother. I need some advice here. What's the deal with marriage? What can I expect?
I know, Sister, but I have a very good excuse.
Yeah. Who'd have thought they'd both be a size 138 regular.
Tim, fill out the alarm card.  Clean the pipe poles, wipe down the ladders and hang some hose.
No.  I need a drink.
Let me take the lead, Stephen...
-- You can't let him turn you against your friends, man --
John, when you're in there... in the fire... do you ever see...
He's alive.
-- You know what Swayzak would do to the department if this got out? --
-- What he would do to your dad's department? You gotta let me finish it --
So that's it? Big bad brother's gonna ride my ass till I cough blood?
Thanks for the speakers.
-- Never mind.
Nah, he's nothin'. It's just sometimes... sometimes you just gotta punch somebody out, y'know?
C'mon, let's crawl home.
Christ, Stephen, let's wait for the hose team...
He didn't listen? He was a fucking candidate! He was your responsibility. He shouldn't have been there in the first place, Stephen.  You burned him.
You're selling dad's boat?
I really should get back. There's... there's something I'm supposed to do.
Saw what?
Everybody did.
I don't know, Brian... I don't know...
What are we going to do about this?
We gotta go to Rimgale, Stephen.
Yeah, well I like to think I'm just a little past hanging out on JP II watching the Irish pick fights and Litwalks barf in the planters.
Green committed to a thousand.  There's another fund-raising party tonight. Marty'd really like you to come.
Well, you did invite me here.
Got anything to drink in there?
Homey.
Uh huh.
You told Swayzak about our arson lead. It's all over the fucking news.
Leave Stephen out of this --
What?
You walked out on this academy six years ago. One week to graduation. You think we forgot that? You think I did?
-- I don't give a damn what your test scores were, maybe you could have been a good firemen, but you had your shot.
Sorry, but it's out of my hands. Try again next year.
Your Dennis' kid.  I work alone.
Glass?
"Trychtichlorate is a binary structured --"
But the right guess on this is arson.
Who all ended up wearing candles for faces...  Swayzak's up to his ass in this somehow. Guy can barely hold a drink in his hand, he's so scared.
It had to be someone who knows numbers. Some kind of fancy accountant. But what's the connection?
I've been lying here hours... just thinking... We're close...  We're not looking in the right place, Brian. This one knows us and we're not looking in the right place...
Four months.
Stephen's not staying here now, Brian. He moved out last April.
Brian, let me come to the point. I'd like to offer you a job.
What the hell are we waiting for?
Brian. He's not doing it right, dad. He never does it right.
I'll be there, goddamn it!
He deserved it. He was born deserving it.
In a fire? Never.  Look, I'm his brother. I care about him, y'know? He was going to get himself killed. Maybe not today, maybe not in a year, but it would've happened. And I couldn't -- I just couldn't...
What's wrong?
And the world -- the whole world.
"Don?"
No Marty, I don't.
Investigator...
Yeah? At least she's alive! I see people get killed every day! Worse yet, tortured first and then killed! The nuns got off easy. Jeez. Cigarette burns. Everyone's all upset about fucking cigarette burns. I'll show you cigarette burns!
Yeah.
Nah...
What the fuck are you? A drug counselor or a drug dealer? And you don't even do your own product! What kind of businessman are you?
Please. Please don't forgive me. I've always hated you for that.
Why? Why can't you hate me? Hate me! Please! Help me!  Hate me! Help me! Hate me!
Why do I dream every night of the whore who brought you water on your road to death? And why have I never forgotten that if she, then I --
I forgive you.
What about the money you owe me on yesterday's game?
Let me think about it.
I wanna go double or nothing on the next game.
Yeah. Sure. Yeah. We're on it bigtime. Lots of leads. You bet.
Here. Look I'll give you the psyho's number You call him yourself and tell him wnat you want.
It's funny, you knew. But the first thing I think of is kneading the bread that I help bake for the soup kitchen. Maybe that's because my the muscles in my arms still hurt.
Did he gots to be.
Ho!
Yeah!
Louder.  They can't hear you.
I didn't mean to scare you like that.
Delacroix.
What makes you think he would write a show about the Mau-Mau's.
Microphone check.  One.  Two.  One. Two.  One.  Two.  Hold up.  I gots to give my peeps some props. Brothers introduce yourself.
I'm a revolutionary.
You might be right.
She's also moorish.
Look at my lips.
Y'know what I mean.  Got a gig yet for Manray and I yet?
Manray needs a job.
And I'm the feet.
Are you crazy?  The joint is crawling with cops now.  You wanna go to Rikers?  Go to the hoosegow?
We was coming to see you.
We're starving.
To what?
Mantan?  I don't even care as long as I'm dancing.  Which reminds me, I need some new kicks.
Why?
Mantan!!
How you sound?
Yes.  And I say yes because who is to judge?  Who is to stand before us and say this is righteous and this is not?  Who?  Who can play God?
Can I finish?  Thank you.  I had a great Aunt, we called her Sister. She went to her grave not believing man had walked on the Moon. 
I'm sorry I'm late.
I didn't find out about this very important staff meeting until...
...to white?  I still feel all of my scripts would make good shows.
I've never been given a fair shot.
It is called: MANTAN - THE NEW MILLENNIUM MINSTREL SHOW.
Mantan and Sleep 'n Eat.  Two real coons.  I know we're way out there but it's satire.
So what.  We would just give the NAACP a donation that would be the end of that.  No such thing as bad publicity.  So what.  Earlier you said singing and dancing.
We think so.
I want a hot, young white director. Maybe the kid, that pheenom who just did that hot new sexy Madonna video.
Probably nuthin', but that's why it's such a sexy way to go. Sometimes an outsider has a fresh new outlook, a different unique perspective.  A black director, y'know what he's gonna do given the subject matter?  With this kid, the possibilities are endless.
We just punched it up a bit.  Made it funnier.
I seriously doubt that will ever happen.  Didn't I tell you I know your people better than you do. But if by some miracle you're correct, I'm gonna invite them inside my house and we'll have a sit down, discuss it like civil human beings.
I want to speak with you.
It's me, Peerless.
Pleased to meet you.
Daddy, she's younger than me.
Where do you go from here?
I didn't mean that, in life.
You getting cold feet?
This is Cheeba.
Let's leave the man in peace so he can get ready.
C'mon.  You were only doing what family is supposed to be doing for family.  You gave your brother a shot.  That's all anybody can ask for, an opportunity, a chance, a shot.  He got his.
Everybody shut up.
I thought it was appropiate.
He's just playing big brother.
Same thing Giuliani said.
Hope the same thing doesn't happen to me.  That's some big shoes to fill.
Yo, DeLa, they tried to lynch my black ass up in dat piece.
What you did is dead wrong.
I don't even know why you're still concerned over him.  Daddy's not with you.
It's gonna be hard for me to get away with the show taking off.
If and when he calls, please don't forget to ask him if he's seen Mantan.
You know, Finlandia vodka?  Yes?
Thank you.  And always smile.
This show was created, conceived by you, a non-threatening African- American male.  Voila.  End of argument.  It can't be racist because you're black.
I'm sure that was the only thing he was impressed with.  You look beautiful like that.
I'm more comfortable around my people.
Money makes the world go round.  It ain't no joke being poor.  I know whatI'mtalkin''bout. Y'knowwhatI'msayin'?  I've lived on the street.  I've been homeless. I've learned how to play the game, work the game, be in the game.
Sleep 'N Eat, one of dem slinky, sexy, little foxy...
No.  That's her second cousin. Who's married to Li'l Bit.
...no, she didn't...
Mantan, it is possible that my hyphenated sentences are entirely too complex for all the intellect contained in that diminutive coconut?
No, before my time.
Say what, Manray?
I'll tell you what it is, Mr. Dugan. I have had enough of Miss Dugan here and your Irish ways.  I ain't used to 'em, sir.
Not yet, but I believe he intends to.
And his baggage?
It must have been some other gate.
I had news of you in Dublin.  Faith, you've begun early, like your father's son, but I think you could not do better than as you have done. But why did you not write home to your poor mother?  She has sent half-a-dozen letters to you in Dublin.
We must write to her today, and you can tell her that you are safe and married to "Brown Bess."
Is Miss Dugan well?
Your Grace, if I am so tame as to take this, then I must give up an honorable and lucrative occupation.
Your honor must lower his voice.
To risk one's life against such people is an imposition.
Deceiving someone without knowing it is something new for me.  If I do not know it, I am innocent.
Then I will respectfully take leave of her.
I'd draw my sword, and cut my way through them.
In so far as I can tell these things -- no.  I believe the Chevalier won the money fairly.
I am riding to Dublin myself, and if your ladyship will allow me the honor of riding with you, I shall do my best to protect you from further mishap.
I am prepared to accept the terms, Mr. Newcombe.
Is he all right, papa?
I am sorry for you Mr. James.  I'm grieved to keep you or any gentleman waiting.  Had you not better to arrange with my doctor or get the cook to flavor my omelette with arsenic?  What are the odds, gentlemen, that I don't live to see Mr. James hang yet?
And he doesn't care about me?
It's ten thirty in the morning.
What do you mean, alone?
We can still come out of this okay. Pike got free, he got a gun, he came after us. That's the story.
This is one of those interrogation tricks, isn't it? You don't give me a cigarette till I tell you more.
That son of a bitch.
And the bodies?
One went off, yeah, but it didn't touch him -- I thought you knew this --
We can prove that you're not Ray Dunbar. Impersonating a fellow Cadet is a court-martial in and of itself --
Sir, yes, sir!
Why?
West... he's dead.
West's. Any kindling for afire?
You're the only one missing a grenade.
Enough to go to prison? Childs' PX scam, Mueller was in on it --
You're lying --
You saw West, right? How was he killed?
From up close or far away?
What don't you know?
No... no, we can just wait till we get back and then tell the M.P.'s --
Coast Guard, special detective detail. We feel this incident may have put the beaches of Florida at risk.
I didn't kill him --
My heart weeps.
So I should stay silent about his misdeeds? The guns went off, I ran in, Childs shot me, Pike and Mueller were dead, and Dunbar was running out the door with the smoking gun --
Well?
I didn't do anything --
I don't know --
I'm assuming that's what made him the dead one?
Okay, then let's widen the search to include the endzone in Giants Stadium and the trunk of my car --
Nevertheless what'? Kendall will testify and that'll be enough.
I wouldn't know where to start.  I guess it was about one man framing another. He thought if the other guy got blamed, people would over look his own wrong doings.
The Senator...
You're drunk --
That's preposterous --
I wanted to see if he was okay --
Sergeant West's served for twenty- three years. He's the public face of the modern Army.
You and the Colonel go back.
You're the Tom Hardy I've been reading about in the papers, right? New Orleans PD fired you for taking bribes from Guissepe Torres.
Senator Jonathan Kendall, of Ohio.
See, Ray, this is what we call "good cop, bad cop". She shouts, I stand up for you, you're grateful, a bond of trust is established.
Best time for banal chit-chat.
You had a mobile of bayonets above your crib.
The very same.
Have no fear, Osborne, we have not yet begun to fight.
I don't think that has anything to do with --
I don't know.
You knew what he was capable of and you just stood by. It was just a matter of time till somebody fragged his ass, and you know what? He deserved it. There's your confession.
Watch me.
Because it's my job. Because people are dead. Because of the whole honor and duty thing, make a difference in the world, crap like that.  We can do this, Hardy.
Kendall maybe would have agreed, but the hurricane buttfucks the cabin --
Let's go talk to Bill...
Good idea.
You mean the falsely accused?
Good, just making sure.
Really.
Nobody saw. But I don't think so.
Mueller. He's as bad as West and we both know it. Now I can't do it, cause I'm tied up, but we get the others to go along --
Oh, yeah, "Excuse me, Sergeant, sir, we don't feel like going out -- we don't want to get rained on." He'll kick our asses from here to Cleveland.
He wanted more than that.
We've been making progress, I see.
It will and you know why? Because you're not a person anymore, you're a cadet in the United States Army; you have no identity, no Miranda warning, and no rights. So I'm gonna throw you to the wolves, and unlike you, I'm gonna get away with it, because you're pissing me off!
Toughens us up, Pike. You don't like it, quit.
No, no that was Cadet Dunbar --
No --
It's too neat.
He tried to burn Dunbar to us. You don't do that if you're not involved.
Sir, yes, sir!
Sir, yes, sir!
Yes.
Not yet.
It truly is.
Fine, I'm doing it.
Thirty years. Maybe more.
No.
What did she look like?
Lucky girl.
You're lucky to get four words out of them in English. But if you were to walk through the jungle, you'd hear them speaking the most elaborate French. Those parrots talk about everything: politics, movies, fashion -- everything but religion.
That's terrible.
Please?
I never knew.
Well, we were all set to, but there was a complication.
Okay.
That poet, Norther Winslow did. He was going to Paris, France. He must have liked it, because no one ever heard from him again.  Tell you what. You take the other way and I'll cut through here. Meet you on the far side.
Make him stop.
Really.
The Old Lady by the swamp.
No, she was old and probably senile. Maybe schizophrenic.
Really.
I said this isn't how I go. The last part is much more unusual. Trust me on that.
Dad?
Do I? I saw an iceberg once. They were hauling it down to Texas for drinking water, only they didn't count on an elephant being frozen inside. The woolly kind. A mammoth.
Then you shouldn't have started with a question. Because people want to answer questions. You should have started with, "The thing about icebergs is..."
What, you're seeing down to my nose? My chin?
They're your favorite flower.
You're a poet. You oughta be able to. And maybe if you'd seen more, you could.
I want you to know, when you left Spectre it opened my eyes. There was a whole life out there that I was not living. So I travelled. I saw France, and Africa, half of South America. Every day a new adventure, that's my motto.
I'm robbing this place.
Because he's dying.
I'll help you.
Mmm, what?
But it's not true.
You're not.
We swam. The Atlantic, it's not that big really.
Yes.
Yes. But that's a different...
He just fell asleep. Josephine's with him.
Yeah. It was quite good actually. Some bits I really liked.
You heard what I said. I'm pregnant. I've been throwing up for weeks.
Name it.
Right.
I thought you could give us the tour this morning. Sort of be our Indian Guide.
What are you doing here?
Of course not. Alexei, he's is my problem.
So I come to England with other actors to make shows, I meet this freak from Novgorod I tell him of you and Chicken and the birthday here we are.
Uh. Do you like England?
Oh nothing.
He says why did you send to Russia for a wife.
Fine. I thought you were leaving today.
John.
He says you are very sad ridiculous man. I don't agree of course. And that you must pay someone to have sex like a prostitute. Nadia is a prostitute. I'm sorry.
He is sure you can do this. Of course you can not.
I'm so sorry.
Sorry?
Happy bath day.
It's makes it easier. Okay.
It makes it faster. If I don't speak to the men, they fall faster. It's pretty obvious why.
Well as it turns out I did.
What? No you're not..
No you're not. How... Nice one. How dumb do you think I am ?
Have you got your passport?
Shut up. Have you got your passport?
Look, if you want to know is he better in bed than you then yes he is.
No. But you tend to tie them up.
You don't want to talk about it.
Okay we won't talk about it.
And that would be Morals. That would be one's own moral sense of decency.
Sometimes neither.
Oh. I think you will recover okay. I think you got what you paid for.
No.
Not really. Maybe a little.
I don't know why I said it. I'm sorry.
Laugh it up.
Maybe I want to die. Don't you want me to die?
No. I think I better just go.
Please. Why not?
Goodbye.
I'm sorry.
Thanks.
Been on the crop. May need to get some extra hands if I don't want to work on Sundays.
Go on, Laz. You can talk to me.
You take her to a doctor?
I already tossed that out.  Somethin' you should'a done to that woman long ago... how she treated you. Of course, that's none of my business.
Hey. You wasn't at'cha work but that nosey gal up at the counter give me your home address. Hope you don't mind me comin' over.
I need ya help again.
You seen my snake-skin shoes?
Hey.
No, ma'am.
That young lady's size, right'cher.
They been keepin' a folder on me cuz of my stomach. Like how it was just before we'd play ball back in school. Thought it was just some tic I got, or ulcers like my daddy had.  I can't... shoot. Target practice I'm a pro. I tag between the numbers each time but...  But when there's really loud noises around me... somethin' happens. I get shaky and... I lose my breath. They called it anxiety. Severe anxiety. It can be fixed and all... just not in time for....  It's a long process but... they sent me home.
You been home yet?
I know about how she was like. But we was different. I's the only person she talked to about it. How she's abused. Terrible things, Gill, just terrible...
You think I'm Ronnie's spy or somethin'? Come tomorrow that dumb- ass gonna be halfway round the world tryin' to keep his head on his shoulders. You think he's gonna be thinkin' about you?
I got others.
I begged him not to go. And he did.
It gets worse there. Leavin' me to my own mind. That's just not good.
That damned, rusty, radiator, bout burned the skin off my legs each time I passed.
Careful how you point that gun, boy.
Boy? You here to make a point, or you here to kill somebody?
Well I don't...
Don't need none.
What do you want?
Or what?
Whose doin' is that?
Hm-mm... Hm-mm...
Uh-uh.
I can handle that.
We drinkin' buddies now?
No joke.
You just havin' a fit. You ain't goin' nowhere.
Been years since I fooled with that.  You know a white girl? Dirty blond hair, split down the middle like?
Huh?
Like I told you.
I never laid a hand on her in anger. Not a day. Not even when I's drinkin'. But this business got me wonderin' what a good shake and slap would do for her.
This ain't got nothin' to do with that woman. Just don't want nobody around me now.
What? I called Bojo, like you say. Called up the fellas in the band...
Why she got a chain on her?
Well, dig in, son. Got plenty to eat.
I gotta ask you. Why do you think Laz is keepin' you chained like this?
So he got it into his head that the only thing gonna keep you from endin' up bleedin' on the side of the road again, without a stitch of clothing on is...  You think he's crazy for thinkin' that?
Rae, look at Ronnie. And tell him how you feel.
Rae don't do this now...
Rae!
I just like dressin' up in these goddamn blue vests.  Your money ticket get shipped today?
Thought you had a man for that.
The hell you call me?
Get rid of it.
Saving your life.
Beats forty hours on a plane.
No.
I didn't know.
I'd feel better if we had some heat.
He couldn't find his ass with both hands.
What does Charlie mean?
Jerry Lee Lewis, Elvis, Dinky Doo And The Don't's.  Let's book, Charlie.  If he starts on Motown, we'll be here all night.
That's what you said in the last three piss pots.
I don't, that's all.
Sure.
We're through.  I mean it.  This is the end of the line, Matsumoto.
I want to yank Kobo.
A resort city, Beppu.
It's done.  You don't have to come.
No.
Kampai.
I followed them.  An hour from the train station.
I couldn't tell.
I don't know.
Yes...
You have a helluva way of asking for help.
You could fake it.
You met her.
I don't remember you saying no.
No one's keeping him here.
Last time you asked me to come along I nearly got a hole in my head.
I'm amused.
Why me?
You're foreigners.
Your visa has expired.  Be on a plane in twenty-four hours or you will be deported.
Look.
I have to get to Sugai.
You're smarter than Kobo.  You know the price of deceit.  Think about it.
He'll find out you took me.  I'm unprotected.  He'll kill us.  All of us.  You don't stand a chance.
I don't think there is another human being in this whole world who would have helped us.
Oh?
It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
Can the maker repair what he makes?
Had in mind something a little more radical.
Dr. Tyrell?
Then let her get away.  I thought you were a pro -- you're supposed to be a fuckin' tracker!
You didn't like her!?
She's not with you?
Yeah.  I got it.
Do you have something against science?
And what in your estimation works?
It's okay.  Forget it.
I like you too.
I'm doing okay.
No.  I got a problem.
I think I'm starting to empathize with these Nexus-sixes.
No rust?
Like to get this position.  Did you or were you asked to do anything lewd or unsavory or otherwise repulsive to your person?
For holes.
It would be my child.
Right.
Dead.
Yeah.
Don't be fooled by appearances.
I don't like the noise.  Just practice.  Practice makes perfect.
I never felt better.
You mean a woman?
Because it's not.
No, I don't.
Go ahead.
Nothing is infallible, but so far the Voight-Kampff scale bas been foolproof.
Discreetly.
Don't move.
What desert?
I never seen a turtle.
I was tired and didn't have any place to go.
Pris.
I've got stuff.  If you wanna go to my place?
You scared me.
Thanks.
What's your problem?
You're all so perfect.
Yes?
She is a dancer! And a lovely one! You would like her very much! Shall we dance?
Fallout shelter. There's a difference.
Oh, brother...
What?!
It certainly is.  I agree with you completely.
We? I'm going home. And, judging by that coat, I'd say you have to get back to the barber college.
You're lost?
Why doesn't that surprise me?
Oh, that's nice.
See? I'm psychic. Not completely, but pretty much. That was pretty good, wasn't it?!
I'm not taking you there, Sweetie. Rule Number One in North America: No strangers in the car.
Heck, no!  What?!
Perry?
Take it. damn it!
I haven't brushed yet.
Can't you please just talk to me for one second?
Oh, stop that!  God! Listen, I know you like me.  I can tell. But you know what? A lot of guys like me.  Not me, exactly. It's more like the legs or the butt or the hair.  Or some combination of the above.
It never works out because I'm into legs and butts and hair myself! That's why! So I wind up with guys who are very good looking, but even more shallow than I am, if you can picture that. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go find another low-paying, demeaning job where some guy named Jerry keeps telling me how lousy his marriage is.
Sorry.
Okay.
You can be single and not alone. Marriage bites!
You said it would be easy!
Is this your house?
Thank-Q!
Well, I know Mom sure likes 'em!
Um-hum.
No.  We keep it in the backyard.  Of course, in the house.  It's in there.
Well...yeah. Okay.
Do I look crazy?
Good-bye!
You think I'm some sort of sap?! Don't you?!
What in the hell are you doing here!! You're supposed to be over on San Vicente Boulevard having unsafe sex with that slut Sophie!!
Well, you had better!!
See! I can't tell them that!  I can't ever let them know. It makes their life..well, frankly... a joke.  I can't let that happen.  You understand?
Yes, sir.
Yes!  Yes!  Oh, Lord!  Yes, oh, yes! But  where is the one who came last night -- all in yellow?!
Of course you do.  I'll stay here and pray.
The front door is open.  Will you be back?
Gerade aus dann links!
Then why go there?
Blow out the candles!
Your roller-skates! I redesigned them! I think this new design will work even better!
Merci!
I'll try.
And, I'm asking you to trust me without understanding why.
You nut!
Really?  Since when?
1959.
What are you talking about? This is the new Mac. You a hacker?
You don't have a computer in your cabin?
Almost all of them.
I know what you mean!  I usually wear a big hat and dark glasses.
Goodbye.
Bye, Adam!
My father is a genius.
Yes. Up here on the fifteenth floor. Goodnight.
Well, that's great then! Terrific...except...it just occurred to me. I don't know where I live! I'm lost! I don't know where home is!  Would you excuse me?
I see what ya mean. Tell you what...I'll give you five hundred dollars in small bills for the whole box.
Hey, smart ass, how 'bout I kick your butt?
I'll be all right.
I just hope this is still good up there.
I was thinking that, uh...you know, while I was up there and all...that maybe I could, you know...try to meet a girl.  I've, been thinking about that a little...just these last...fifteen years or so.
Yes, ma'am.
Yes.
Calm down, please. This man needs help and you need protection from him. That's obvious.
What?!  A light!  Yes, I've got a light!
You bet, hon!
Time? Oh, no Calvin. It's not time yet. I still have--
Yes.
Rather safe than sorry. That's my motto!
No.
I'm not hungry.
No, Calvin, you're favorite.
How could you?! This is just like home!
What shall we call him?
Right here!
Yes, he's very bright, dear. Much like his father. But you know, Calvin, maybe he's a little...young for school.
You bet.
Yeah. Let's dig in!
Just open the door.
It's an archaic colloquialism, roughly meaning..."good".
Well, I am the head of this household--
--and we will--
Yes, dear, I know.
I thought ten years.
Shana Gillroy's apartment.  Remember her?  The model who went to Harvard? Well, I better get going!  Bye, Adam. Nice coat!
You know, I don't know.  And looking at you, I don't care.  It's been too long, Eve.
What's that supposed to mean?
Those sluts!
Uh, yes, you do.
From the oddest place. His parent's told him. I don't think I got that memo.
What?!
Oh.  Well, you're...certainly welcome!
Then what?
I've got secondaries of an engine fire and I'll need to find a clear area to eject.
You look good, Jeffrey. Did you have a nice flight?
Aunt Barbara. I'll try not to get depressed.
No, I'm just going to walk around the neighborhood. Don't worry.
Okay honey.
Hey, I brought some friends. And some beer.
Darling, where are the glasses? Oh, here they are.
Shit. Let's drink to something else. Let's drink to fuckin'. Say here's to your fuck Frank.
Yes.
Sure I do. I understand he's in the hospital. How is he?
Yep, that's right. Let's take a look at it.
It must be great.
The criminals are winning.
Hi. Hi Sandy. I'm sorry to bother you, but I've got to talk to you.
I can't tell you the whole story. I. I took it upon myself. I can't say more.
Yes sir.
Jeffrey.
You said hello, to Frank. You wanted to talk to someone? Don? And little Donny. You said something about Momma loves you. And something about a Meadow Lane. Something in an hour. I don't remember any more.
Well.
I, I don't know.
No.
Nothing. Are you alright?
I'll go then.
No.
You don't?
Go then. I can't let you put it in me now but I want you. I like you.
Frank? Can you stand up?
No. Please, Dorothy. Why are you in so much trouble?
Or do you just want me? I'm going to let you enter me now.
I sure don't hate you.
What do you want?
No. I told you. I don't want to hurt you. I want to help you. I think I know some of what is happening to you.  Dorothy? Frank has your husband and son. Dorothy? Doesn't he? You have to do something Dorothy. Go to the police.
What if Frank came over here and found us?
Kiss me.
Just get outta my bed.
Men are crazy. Then they put their craziness into me. Then it makes me crazy. Then they aren't so crazy for awhile. Then they put their craziness in me again.  It's burning me, but I love you. I do, I do. Did you know that? Did you know that I love you?
Okay. Soon? Do you think I'm too fat?
I'm getting a little bit fat. I hate that.
No.  Hi baby.
'Cause he's comin' back, that's what for. Frank's got you really loaded tonight.
You want to see him too, right?
Come on, Frank. Let's go. Please.
Right here Frank. You want me to pour it?
I've made arrangements with Dr. Gynde for 10:30. But Jeffrey, you'll have to walk over; I need the car this morning.
Of course, Jeffrey.
Yeah. okay.
Yeah.
I mean, you don't exactly have the build for a football. I mean, no offense.
You were pretty popular. Didn't you run for some office?
Am I bothering you?
That's too bad.
I don't really know much but bits and pieces. I hear things. My room is right above my father's office. The ear, there's no corpse in the morgue missing an ear, and it did come off a living person. That's direct from the Coroner's Office. The person is unknown. There are a couple of cases I get mixed up on, but I think there are some people who were brought in for questioning on a murder case that could have something to do with the ear. I heard some of the same names.
Yeah. It's close by, that's what's creepy. They've had her under surveillance for a couple of months, except I don't know what they've found out because my father isn't in charge of her.
Where are they?
I don't know, like I said, she's not my father's case.
Yeah, I guess so.  What are you going to do now that you're home?
Still, it must be kinda rough.
Thanks for the tour. It was nice talking to you.
I'm here, aren't I?
Alright. the first thing is to get into her apartment and open a window that I could crawl into later.
Yes and no. Did you recognize him?
You didn't goof it up, but you still owe me one. I want to sneak in tonight. It's Friday, do you have a date tonight?
Well, it's Friday night and you're a beautiful girl. I guess you would have a date, that does that.
Why not?
Look, it can wait till Sunday.
Yeah.
I don't know if you're a detective or a pervert.
He got a little jealous.
Yes.
Why are there people like Frank. Why is there so much trouble in this world?
Maybe. But I think the Yellow Man is on drugs. I think Frank supplies him.
I'm seeing something that was always hidden. I'm involved in a mystery. I'm learning. And it's all secret.
Yeah. I think so. I just had to tell him some of what I knew. Is Friday still on?
Let's wait for some slow one.
Okay.
Frank!!!
Go ahead!
Yeah. I just saw him outside. Maybe the robins are here.
Yeah, nice meetin' you.
Well he's the one shooting up all his guys, right? He's scared of the kid. Says he's real good, got every available gun in the city up there.
Hey, Augustus, I need your help, I got a serious problem here. I'm not screwing around.
Yeah. I was only twelve or thirteen when you guys used to talk about him, like he was a ghost or something.
Go find one.
Mother Mary, full of grace.
Look in the trash around their hands. See if you can find me two bullet casings. 45's, if my eye serves me right. Don't disturb them. Mark them as they lay. Newman, root through this shit.  If this was a sink find me some metal parts. Gimme a faucet or a drain cover or something.
Let's do him right here.
Listen. Something's been bothering me about last night.
He knows you, man. He knows all you want is to move up. That's all. A smooth hitter woulda gone in there, seen it was a wash and slipped out. But a guy like you? Knowin' this is your only chance? Waitin' eighteen years?
MEEE! ME! I'm the guy! I know everyone, their habits, where they hang out, who they talk to. I know where they fuckin' live. We could kill everyone!
I-I'll tip her.
I know what the fuck he looks like!
What?  What, that guy?
Okay, just calm down. He could hurt us, brother. He could ruin the whole thing.
Mother, what are you sayin'? You're talkin' crazy here.
What... the dirty bitch! I hope ya trounced her a good one!
We paid attention in school.
Our mother can see through bags.
An F.B.I. agent came by the bar. He left me his c-c, he left me his c-c, he left me this.
Right.
I gave him his first lesson in sensitivity toward the fairer sex just today.
Oh, you've lost it, haven't ya?
What is all this "they" shit? This ain't a movie.
We'll find it. Just calm down.
Asshole!? I'm not the rope-totin' Charlie Bronson wanna-be that's getting' us lost!
Yeah, and ya gotta shoot at him for ten minutes.
Yes, we are.
Yes.
Holy shit. Who? How many?
So, when are you getting a plastic fuck doll?
A-fuckin'-men!
It is your corrupt we claim.
Can she I.D. them?
He was the only one done right. Two in the back of the head.
They shot him at a downward angle.  They put him on his knees.
Twist of lemon!
Why do you always disrespect me like that?
Don't kill me. Oh shit, please no. I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man!... the funny man... the funny.
Hallelujah, Jaffar.
We're like 7-Eleven. We ain't always doing business, but we're always open.
Use your brain for once. Is it so unbelievable they don't care about you? You are fuckin' dead, you go in there today. Dead!
I'll be back at 9:00.
I'm fuckin' fine.  Catch you on the flip side.
Hey, Murph.
You'll make it outta here. You can't ever stop, not ever.
Y-Yes my son.
It's ethics. I put evil men behind bars, but the law has miles of red tape and loopholes for these... cocksuckers to slip through. I've found out there are these two young men who fix the situation with an iron fist. As if they have God's permission. But what they do is wrong and I should arrest them... technically.
You believe?
You have entered the house of the Lord of your own free will speaking of beliefs and feelings. Is it so much to believe that God has brought you here?
Do you think they would harm an innocent man, for any reason?
That's who I'm doing this for, now open the fuckin' thing.
The... The funny man.
Joey Bevo said it was important. Said I had to give it to him myself.
I caught your show down at the velvet room at the Holiday Inn, loved it when you busted into Viva Las Vegas.
Dignan, it's --
No. This is he.
Yeah, I saw it.
Yeah, I heard that.
Hang on a second.
No, Dignan. It's not your gun. It's all of ours.
Where's the other stocker?
Like he meant it.
Like he would find Dignan. One day.
Dignan, those aren't running shoes.
They obviously weren't designed for racing.
I'll say it.
Hi.
Jerry.  And this is my associate Cornelius.
Sure.
No kidding.
As long as he gets out OK.
After that my parents never let me go to Dignan's again.
If you say so.
No. I'm going to swim. I'll see you later.
OK.
Can you hand me those french fries.
Dignan. I can't do that. All right? I just can't.
You're so spoiled. What is "not good" to you? Only a few hundred --
Her name's Inez. Stop calling her the housekeeper.
That's Applejack. You want to meet him?
Who's Mr. Henry?
Let me feel that.
Bob!
Roger.
Good. It's supposed to be.
It's going back down.
Nobody move!
Applejack's stuck in the elevator?
I'll see you there.
I don't think so.
Yeah.
Oh, I'd say about --
You're kidding.
Thanks.
Me?
Hopscotch. The code name is hopscotch.
Sure.
No.
I didn't do anything.
His health isn't very good, you know. They take that into account.
Dies y nueve.
No.
God, yes. Like silk.
Like silk?
Uh-uh.
True.
I don't know, Bob. What about one of those?
I told you he's crazy.
No, I was saying crazy like a lunatic.
Let's just go.
I just want to see how much bullets it takes.
God DAMMIT.
That's too bad.
I don't want to talk about it.
The cops say it's a special kind of scale drug dealers use in selling marijuana.
I was just going to use it to see how much I had.
I can't do that, Bob.
That's right. I only have one vote. We'll go talk with Anthony and figure it out.
Man, I don't want to go into this.
I never agreed to that.
Yeah?
Who's watching the door? What the fuck are you doing? Get back in position.
Where's Applejack?
Here we go.
I'd appreciate it if you didn't go around telling people lies about me.
No. I didn't run away. I went out of town.
26 weeks.
I don't know. Are you in, Anthony?
You're going to need a boxman for this one. But that can be arranged.
He's damn good.
Sure.
Got a little lucky.
Fight. You know.
Mr. Henry?
It's locked.
And the Landy woman?
He does. I've been down to the archives. I have the files, Ward.
What happened? Jason Bourne happened.  You've got the files? Then let's cut the crap. It went wrong. Conklin had these guys wound so tight they were bound to snap. Bourne was his number one -- guy went out to work, screwed the op and never came back. Conklin couldn't fix it, couldn't find Bourne, couldn't adjust. It all went sideways. Finally there were no options left.
Dead in a ditch? Drunk in a bar in Mogadishu? Who knows?
And Danny Zorn, what was that?
No. You lost your way.
What do you have, Danny?
Jesus...
It's nothing. It's just a picture.
What?
Then what?
Sorry. Old habits.
No. There's nothing new.
We pushed it. We got lazy.
It's wrong. Guy with a rental car and hundred dollar sneakers sleeps in a tent?
No. Not this. This is real.  And he's right there... 
Back there -- at the corner -- Hyundai -- silver --
We can't wait to be sure.
What?
Where are you going?
Tell me later.
You do?
Your first assignment was Geneva.
You never worked Berlin...
Ramstein Air Base, Germany.  Before the wall fell you would have woken up in a Russian prison hospital.
What's that?
I want to look at the room.  Check it out.
What?
Here?
Me? Four years.
What do you want from me? I was reassigned. I'm out.
Alright... I want you, Kurt and Kim to stay on Bourne, track everything that's out there...
You are surprised he would lie? Balliol was murdered in a church yesterday. You are Longshanks' new designate. You will be king.
So the Scots will have none of them, will they? My armorers have already made a thousand.
You mock us with a smile?
Wallace's followers.
Wallace's? For treason there is no trial. Tomorrow he will be charged, then executed.
Before he lost his powers of speech, he told me his one comfort was that he would live to know Wallace was dead.
I rest.
We've lived a dream together. A dream of freedom!
Armed?
With your father and brother gone, they'll kill us and burn the farm!
I should'a remembered the eggs.
A common thief.
He was so brave. With courage alone he nearly won.
Humbly, M'lord.
Let her speak.
Confess, and you may receive a quick death. Deny, and you must be purified by pain. Do you confess? ...DO YOU CONFESS?!
Thank you for inviting.
And I with you. But you must wake.
A magistrate wished to capture him, and found he had a secret lover, so he cut the girl's throat to tempt Wallace to fight -- and fight he did.
SLAVES ARE MADE IN SUCH WAYS!
It does me good to see you.
I cannot love you for the sake of revenge.
It will numb my wits, and I must have them all. If I'm senseless, or if I wail, then Longshanks will have broken me.
Nobles? What does that mean -- to be noble? Your title gives you claim to the throne of our country. But men don't follow titles, they follow courage! Your arm speaks louder than your tongue. Our people know you. Noble and common, they respect you. If you would lead them toward freedom, they would follow you. And so would I.
The dogs have a scent. My scent. Someone must have given it to them.
Exactly.
No English lord would trust an Irishman!
Not according to his teacher. It just got me thinking about Jason and what if Evan's inherited his father's condition?
A journal. Just have him write down everything he does.
It could be extremely useful to jog his memory. See if he remembers anything new the next day. And I'll have the test results back in a few days.
But you must have something to go on?
So what did you find.
The hemorrhaging... the neural damage is irreparable. I'm frankly surprised he still has use of his motor functions.
When did you ever care about getting to school on time?
Please. He got straight A's without ever touching a book. That was the one area where his memory never failed him.
No, it's just weird with him being such a brain and all, I just wondered if he was ever able to remember stuff he'd forgotten.
Sure...
Cute, Evan.
You know my father?
I'm standing next to Kayleigh, my hands are over her ears.
No, protecting her.
I see a car.
I can't... the car vanishes and all of a sudden I'm on the ground in the woods.
Where are my goddamn books?
My journals! Where are they?
Photos?
What?
Sorry, dude. Just figured it'd be okay with you bein' sick and all.
So let's go. This place creeps me out.
Well, sure. I'll try to remember. Shoot.
Mmmm... You give good compliment. Clean up and come back to bed.
Those are your clothes, silly.
The bottom. When you're just a piece of meat waiting for the next attack.
Why's that?
Do you remember when I was a kid and I had those blackouts?
We have to get you to Sunnyvale. You're having one of your famous hemorrhages.
Yeah, I think I gotta get these fixed or something.
When my folks split, they gave me and Tommy a choice who we wanted to live with. I couldn't stand my dad, but I knew if I moved to my mom's I'd never see you again.
Quit acting like some retard or I'll call your mother and tell her what a naughty little shit you've been.
Uh-huh. Mom says I have your eyes and your --
Who's to say you can't make things better?
Bullshit. I'll send you a postcard when I've made everything perfect again.
We'll find out soon enough.
Damn, Evan, on the D.L.
I'd say blow me. Get the pledges to do it.
Typical psych major. A complete wise ass. And how's your project coming? Still planning to change the way we humble scientists view memory assimilation?
It was like Tommy was possessed or something. There was a hate in his eyes that I couldn't really call human.
Maybe because they never do.  So Don Juan, you pass out on all your dates?
Hold your horses, man. It's here somewhere. I saw it when I was a kid.
What happened?? Where are we?!
What's wrong with you?!
Oh goody, nothing like spinning my chair around to a techno mix of Hava Nagila til I puke.
Sorry, Mrs. T. He's been out of sorts lately.
You're such a retard!
Ain't gonna work this time, buddy. Look how small that fuse is! I'll get killed.
-- Now, just a minute. Who told you to ask me that?
Eight weeks. We come from Bulgaria. Oh, things are very bad there, Monsieur. A devil has the people by the throat. So, Jan and I, we, we do not want our children to grow up in such a country.
Oh, yes, please.
-- He's just a lucky guy.
Thank you, but I hardly think --
I'm sorry. It is.
But we who are still free will do all we can. We are organized, Monsieur, underground like everywhere else. Tomorrow night there is a meeting at the Caverne du Bois. If you would come...
-- Forget it, Emil. Mistakes like that happen all the time.
It has been a pleasure to meet you.
It's not for sale.
Suppose you run your business and let me run mine.
Well, you're in good company. Renault and Strasser probably think so, too.
Oh, by the way, my agreement with Sam's always been that he gets twenty- five percent of the profits. That still goes.
Not for sure, Monsieur, but I will venture to guess that Ugarte left those letters with Monsieur Rick.
What value is that? You may recall what German guarantees have been worth in the past.
He hasn't played it in a long time.
Why I'm so lucky. Why I should find you waiting for me to come along.
I'm sorry for asking. I forgot we said "no questions."
I'm on their blacklist already, their roll of honor.
Yeah. It's pretty bad timing. Where were you, say, ten years ago?
Looking for a job.
Ah, that's the new German 77. And judging by the sound, only about thirty-five miles away.
No, no, no, no. We must leave.
Well, I did. Every one of them. Mostly I remember the last one. A wow finish. A guy standing on a station platform in the rain with a comical look on his face, because his insides had been kicked out.
No, Rick. No, you see, Victor Laszlo is my husband... and was, even when I knew you in Paris.
The stairs from the street.
It was your cause, too. In your own way, you were fighting for the same thing.
What of it? I'm going to die in Casablanca. It's a good spot for it.
-- You've got to listen to me. Do you have any idea what you'd have to look forward to if you stayed here? Nine chances out of ten we'd both wind up in a concentration camp. Isn't that true, Louis?
And I said I would never leave you.
Oh, he never... well...  he's got a girl up at the Blue Parrot. He goes up there all the time.
I don't know what you mean, Miss Ilsa.
If we would walk out so soon, it would only call attention to us. Perhaps Ugarte's in some other part of the cafe.
Victor, I'm afraid for you.
Goodnight.
Yes, I'm ready.  Goodbye, Rick. God bless you.
I wasn't sure you were the same. Let's see, the last time we met --
Thank you. I try.
Go ahead.
Yes. I found that a very expensive hobby, too. But then I never was much of a businessman.
Yes, I get the point.
Good. I've got the letters right here, all made out in blank.
But you didn't know she was at my place last night when you were. She came there for the letters of transit. Isn't that true, Ilsa?
Here it is.
Yes.
No. Two champagne cocktails, please.
Ilsa, I don't wish to be the one to say it, but it's late.
Thank you.
Well, perhaps I shall like it in Casablanca.
I was in a German concentration camp for a year. That's honor enough for a lifetime.
Yes.
I should like to discuss some matters arising from your presence on French soil.
Herr Laszlo, you have a reputation for eloquence which I can now understand. But in one respect you are mistaken. You said the enemies of the Reich could all be replaced, but there is one exception. No one could take your place in the event anything unfortunate should occur to you while you were trying to escape.
I have already heard about this cafe, and also about Mr. Rick himself.
Thank you.
I admit he is very clever. Three times he slipped through our fingers. In Paris he continued his activities. We intend not to let it happen again.
It may interest you to know that at this very moment he is on his way here.
And what in heaven's name brought you to Casablanca?
Huh!
What, again?
I thought it was because we let you win at roulette.
Maybe he's not quite as romantic as you are.
Louis, whatever gave you the impression that I might be interested in helping Laszlo escape?
I was born in New York City if that'll help you any.
-- Hello, Ilsa.
Well, it looks like you're a little late.
Yeah? Why?
I am shocked, shocked to find that gambling is going on in here!
There's still something about this business I don't quite understand. Miss Lund, she's very beautiful, yes, but you were never interested in any woman.
Tell me, when we searched the place, where were they?
That's so long ago, I don't remember.
Take your hands off me!
Victor Laszlo published the foulest lies in the Prague newspapers until the very day we marched in, and even after that he continued to print scandal sheets in a cellar.
Hello Ugarte.
Well, what makes you think I haven't?
For a price, Ugarte, for a price.
I don't want them here overnight.
Yeah, but I ain't got time to spend the money I make here.
No.
No, sir. I'm waiting for a lady.
Yeah, boss?
Yes, boss.
Survive today, that's the point.
Why do they have to die for me?
But I have promises to keep.  And miles to go before I sleep.  And miles to go before I sleep.  Got to fix the sea anchor.  Use the sail.
You are.
There was an unavoidable delay.
Do you...have any more packages to deliver?
Hey, be nice to it, it'll be nice to you.
You smell like formaldehyde.
What do you want me to say?  That I thought I'd done a great job but it all turned to shit?  That I might as well have gone sailing for all the good I did?
A puppy's got a little more personality than a fish.
You want to.
Look, we'll do our trip as soon as I get back.
I thought you might have.
I know.
My epitaph.
Your calendar, your cell phone, your whoo pig sooey hat, some pictures of that ketch you wanted.
Not when you have no choice.
It means a lot...that you came.
There's a sweep leaving Memphis in an hour, goes through Sydney.
Dehydration.  Vitamin deficiency. Protein deficiency.  Any or all of the above.
You are aware of the potential disruptiveness on your loved ones when you return to your old life?
No.
Let's eat.
Sixty three pounds consumed per capita, up from twenty seven in 1960.  Going to pass beef.  Chicken's global.  No religious taboos.  You don't see your Hindus and your Muslims boycotting poultry.
I'm doing fine.
There's settled folks, and there's nomads.  You're just not a settled folk. You never belonged here.
Roger got me on.  I wasn't doing anything, and -- but you're back, you're really back.  I would have come to Memphis, but --
The tide saved me, Mom.  I lived by it. I'm just wondering where it will take me next.
Kamal, you're breaking up.  Can you hear us?
Can you find her?
What?  Let Paris hold its plane?  Let Memphis take care of it?  Let somebody down the line clean up your mess?
It's a ketch Kelly and I had chartered.
Stan, it's Chuck...Chuck Noland...
Want to see my raft?
You should have smelled me.
I braided them.
Time I had lots of.
Forty-three days.
To Wilson.
Permission granted.
It claims to restore monthly regularity.
I'm *not* a doctor. I haven't been to medical school--I haven't even been to high school!
I'm *not* a doctor!
What for, Buster? What would you do if you met them?
Better than I can!
Good night, Daddy.
Daddy, *please*...
Burma!
Yes. But it's closed all the time now, because of the blackout.
I didn't say that. Growing up in an orphanage, you're always lonely. You're just never alone.
Nobody will swim here until next summer. By then, the water will have rubbed the glass smooth against the sand--there won't be any sharp edges.
Well, we can't force her. It's her decision.
*Go* anywhere? Of course not! That would be *doing* something, wouldn't it? We wouldn't want to *do* something. Let's just sit here all night!
He's *paralyzed*!
What do you want me to *do*?
No. It ain't Muddy. Muddy's just...
They wanted a girl.
How old are you, dear? Thirteen?
You *bet* it's a heavy sedation! The fetus is unexpelled, her uterus is punctured, she has acute peritonitis, and there's a foreign object. I think it's a crochet hook.
*Alcohol* killed him--he drank himself to death.
She's dead now, too. She was a nanny.
No. She was an immigrant.
No. Dr. Larch will be performing the procedure.
Really! Is it serious?
I don't *have* any time. There's a *war*!
Actually, I volunteered.
Out back, there's a shed. It's just a mess. If that shed was better organized, I could put my truck in there.
What about the worms? Most of these apples are the drops--off the ground, right? There have to be worms.
Yes, for both.
One: it's illegal. Two: I didn't ask how to do it--you just showed me.
In other words, scurvy.
But isn't Fuzzy just... well, underdeveloped?
It's *your* splice! You blame me for everything!
Mrs. Worthington, I feel I'm very lucky to be here.
Right.
Rose, listen--don't *do* anything. You know, I mean to yourself. Please listen...
Anyway, I was just showing you this guy as an example of what's available-- I didn't think you'd be interested.
They told Muddy his feet was too flat!
We see you next harvest.
Who *live* here in this cider house, Peaches? Who grind them apples, who press that cider, who clean up the mess, and who just plain *live* here... just breathin' in the vinegar?  Somebody who *don't* live here made them rules. Them rules ain't for *us*. *We* the ones who make up them rules. We makin' our *own* rules, every day. Ain't that right, Homer?
Well, Muddy, we can look at all these angry stars Homer's been readin' to us about.
*You* taught her, I suppose...
That's right. I know you understand how I feel, Homer--you is breakin' them rules, too. Ain't that right?
Now, now, darlin'... Jack just needs to know what business he's in.
She's about the most beautiful girl I ever seen--I don't know if she's the nicest.
The good news, Jack, is you're half- undressed for *swimmin'*...
He ain't never been outta Maine!
That's right. So, brainiacs that we are, we thought we'd be innovative and relocate east. Try our luck with a straight corporate loan out here.
A capacity for gross fund recovery. Yeah, we got that part.
And you have this letter of intent?
You need some convincing. Consider it a convincer.
Two million.
Gordo plays the inside. You're the Shill.
No. I'm not the Anti-Christ. Or the Prince of Darkness. I'm just a guy looking for some answers.
Just the last three weeks.
We can't all be model citizens such as yourself.
Back in WWI or WWII, one of the WW's, if you took the time to light three cigarettes with one match, some Nazi would be able to figure out where you were. Then, well... It was the last cigarette you and your two buddies ever had. So three on a match is bad luck.
Let's see... Let's suppose he gets to Customs and he gets caught. We get our money back, but then we have to deal with a criminal investigation. I don't much like that idea. Then again, let's suppose he actually gets through Customs. Now, that'll be something. We recover the money in cash and let the insurance cover the corporate fraud. We double our money.
Fine. But only if we recover the cash.
You're pissed we didn't get credit?
We sure Big Al threw him to us?
Alright, let's all put our dicks back in our pants for a second. Is this the best thing to do?
People have tried this before, Jake. It's never worked. Teddy Fraiser and his crew went on vacation in Chicago for it. Last year, Mumps got pinched in L.A.
It's alright. Grant's one of the good guys.
So what? We just stay clear of him.
That's a lot of cash. He came up with it pretty quick.
Well, this is just fucking great...
Tonight. Just me.
Two million.
How's that? He works for Gillette.
So then Miles walks straight into the Creative Director's office and says "The code's fine, the program's for shit" and throws down like a thousand pages of code on the guy's desk!
Eight A.M. flight.
What do I always tell you guys? Don't spend it all. Sooner or later we're going to run into some bad luck. Save some. Put it away, so when shit like this happens, you're not desperate. That's it. The gig's up.
You know, back in the day, grafting was considered a gentleman's racket. Good suits, good food... The Underworld of the Underworld. A grifter had to survive on his wits, his instincts... I like that. I like the idea of that. These days, things being what they are, guys like me gotta stay low. It's all take, take, take. You can't just be fucking witty about it.
Because you killed one of my crew.
No. Just confidence.
I said take off your fucking shirt.
Yeah Well, Sobo's kid needs braces.
Something stupid.
My wife and I are just taking a little vacation.
Thank you. Actually, it's our first anniversary this weekend. She thinks I'm here to pick up something for my mother, but it's actually a gift for her. Think I've fooled her?
What about this situation makes you think I can answer that question right now?
You interested in a little work?
You're working Daffy's block. He was going to break your kneecaps. Pick- pockets can be so bitchy sometimes. I told him you were with us, so that's two you owe me.
Why?
You're just going to have to trust me.
Uh-huh.
Intuition.
Sounds respectable.
You sure we're clear?
How do you know the King's going to let you walk?
What do we need another Shill for?
We never had a problem with that before.
No, the corporate papers have to be legit. But you gotta score an I.D. A clean one. Talk to Suits. I gotta get us a Banker.
Where the hell is she?
You going to have the time?
Don't worry, I'll settle up with your boss. We haven't skipped town yet.
Huh? Oh. She's alright.
I want to get out from under all this for good. And I want to fuck them all doing it.
Can't do it Suits. I can't lay down for this one.
We got a good thing going here. You want to blow it over an overbite?
I try.
A Fed? Is he close?
I got it figured out... He's got this thing with bathrooms. If he makes it through Customs, he'll be heading for the john.
You think this is a good idea? We never did this kinda shit before.
No. Thanks.
Look, now I'm pumping you. I'm sorry. It's none of my business. It's just that you're not like the others.
A couple I know are getting married.
How about we split the diff... Seven-fifty.
Seven-fifty.
Did she?  You were pretty thick at one time.
I want a job, Giles.
Habib?
I'll try and make it.
You want me drunk?
Come on, Marion. Let's face the truth. Nobody's going to publish it.
450? What did you do, just walked in and said I want to be a croupier? Don't you need training?
Gambling's not about money.
I thought you wouldn't want to spend Christmas Day alone in here.
There was a message, wasn't there?
Marion!  What did you tell the police?
Then what?
I want to buy a car.
Found a job?
Don't let yourself down.
You know where I'm from?
So why did you come to my casino?
First visit to London?
In the casino.
The debts.
Remember the guy who cheated at the table?
Was that why you did the two grand? I couldn't help you.
Robbery's not criminal?
You're serious.
I've come to know you. You're honest.  I trust you.
I told you, all bets are off.
Yes.
The date's not set yet. I'll call you. One last thing: the man you're going to catch cheating, he may get violent. But you know how to deal with cheats.
Turn left at the lights.
No thanks, Matt. I need my eight hours.
If I see you do it again, I'll report it.
Just girls. What are you drinking?
I'd like to buy you a drink.
What are you talking about? It's 11, I've won. With this lady.
Wait a minute. You got yourself barred.
They've been tested.
What for?
I don't gamble, Mr Reynolds.
Fine.
Look, bomb...
Key? Key? What is the key?
Christ, twenty seconds, Christ!
Oh, God...
It's Talby. He's drifting away from the ship without his jetpack.
Well, I show a 95% probability of sentient life in the Horsehead Nebula...
Well, there's the possibility of...
He just likes it up in the dome, that's all.
I read the same here.
-- open quantum latches --
Check at six minutes.
Armed.
Thanks.
No.
Bomb?
Of course.
I am always receptive to suggestions.
That's good. Very good. Now then, how do you know that anything else exists?
Why, that would mean... I really don't know what the outside universe is like at all, for certain.
That is correct.
Of course not.
Yes, well...
True, but since this is so, I have no proof that you are really telling me all this.
I said I'm trying to reach Talby. Something's wrong with the damn intercom. I need a last-minute diameter approximation.
I'll check it.
Yes, Doolittle.
Which one?
Commander Powell is dead.
Yeah, Doolittle. What's up?
Yes, Talby, what is it?
Sh, Talby, don't bother me now.
I really liked you too, Talby. Hey, some debris from the ship! It's coming right by me.
I'm glad you've come to talk with me, Doolittle. It's been so long since anyone has come to talk with me.
Ah... pity, pity...
What was that, Doolittle?
It didn't work?
Sorry, Doolittle. I've forgotten so much since I've been in here. So much.
Doolittle, hello?
Ah... it seems to me, Doolittle... Sorry, I've drawn a blank. Hold it. I'll have it again in a minute. I forget so many things in here, so many things. Hold on, just a minute, let me think...
Yeah, the skipper always was lucky.
Yeah?
Sooo...whattya think?  Maybe after I betray the woman who trusts me and you take her and her daughter out and execute them...we could go on a date.  Play a little miniature golf or somethin'.
Actually, that's not gonna be necessary.
You're in the last two seconds, you don't cut the crap.
That's a lotta crap.
You didn't tell me you lived with her.
Justine was not an unwilling participant.
And when the fog lifted, there's Darren with his head under Justine's skirt.
I don't get involved with guns.
Can you help me get her back?
Are we in some kind of trouble?
When?
Mommy, I'm scared.
Girl's gotta make a living.
Guess it wasn't the pizza delivery guy.
Fortunately, my needs are met in that department.
People had a choice, even if they took it for granted.  And now they don't.
I won't be staying.
It was open.
That would be appropriate, yes.
It's alright, Peter, we're fine.
You'd think a guy who's taken on the job of saving the world would have a few more important things to do than traipse around after some girl.
Only when I meet someone I have to know everything about.
He was working on something called Project Manticore, which was using recombinant DNA to produce a superior human...a warrior...an advanced infantry soldier.
How much do you know?
Like extra virgin olive oil, the best of the best.
Your help.
So, you know the lengths he'll go to keep her from going public... I'm turning Lauren over to Canadian law enforcement tomorrow.  They'll put her in witness protection, but if you're with her the risk of her safety goes way down.
She's put her life on the line, and her faith in me.
Somebody's got to.
I've never been much for trying to understand why bad things happen, I just know they do.  So the job's to figure out how to deal with the consequences.  Which you did... You took that sonuvabitch out.
And I feel real bad about all that but it doesn't mean I need to get involved.
Civilization as we know it is unraveling before our eyes.  But Logan and Max, with a song in their hearts are gonna march into battle to keep that from happening.
Zack... He made it... He's alive...
You don't want to.
Can't help you.
A friend of your fiance's.
He been sleeping in a T-shirt lately?  That's so you won't see the fingernail marks on his back.  Bet you didn't know your boyfriend finds a little pain exciting.  He didn't either...at first.
Only a last name would be nice.  Or the nearest town to this...clinic.
Like you said, maybe somebody's tracking one of your investigations.
Sure you wanna be havin' this conversation over the phone?
Got a pencil?
One-seven-four-nine-five Natoma.
Straight.
What, you gonna put me on your Christmas card list?
She's gonna want to hear for herself.
But I'll take a rain check...
Even if she doesn't dump me, which is unlikely, she'd never be able to trust me again.
And we're sure Lydia's gonna make her move?
You don't.
I was on call. 
Theo's dead.
Gin.
Better ease up then, Hawk. Wouldn't want to give you whiskey dick would we?
Hawk.
Amanda Finch. Her ex is one of the wealthiest businessmen in Detroit. Play your cards right and you could hit paydirt. She like 'em young.  And since you look a little new at this, let me give you three words of advice. Hard to get. Think it, act it, know it, be it. Nothing a woman loves more than when you beat her at her own head games.
Yeah?
I don't care. I wanna hear more.
My dad's company is relocating him. We're moving. That's why I was acting so freaky in school today. I thought it was the last time I'd ever see you. Anyway, open the box. I would have given it to you this morning, except... like I said, I was freaking out.
Just for the record, I understood the last part of what you said, but for a while there you guys were making no fucking sense whatsoever.
One more time in English.
I've been in love with her since the second grade.
Never mind with the too bad shit. I got a crazy plan, but only the craziest among us can pull it off.
And when is she due back from that groinecologist's convention anyway?
Curly.
And if it ain't cleaned off?
Sorry, man, no can do. But I'll be here for a while if you scare up the extra gravy.
All right. After school we double- time it to your house for the tix before heading to the train station for the 2:45 to Detroit Rock City.
Guys, GUYS! Come on, if this is anyone's fault, it's mine. I was the one who grabbed Trip's jacket by mistake. It's my fault and I apologize.
Uh-uh. Don't tell us, Jam. Just show us.
Besides, those jeans are so tight I can see your penis.
Alright, Father, here it is. About two weeks ago I went to my cousin's wedding and one of the bridesmaids asked me if I wanted to take a bath.
Okay... when she peeled off that gown, you'll never guess what she was wearing underneath.
Smug, Trip! Not snug, smug.
Huh. St. Bernard's. Figures it's named after a canine.
I can see that, bright boy. What happened to it?
A likely story. Hand it over, kid.
You heard me, nad breath. My time's precious and I think that's a reasonable price to pay for your sorry life.
Yeah, you did!
GOOD MORNING!
Donnie. Donnie Darko.
Well... the thing is, nobody remembers their infancy. And anyone who says they do is lying. We think that this would help develop memory earlier in life.
If you could see your path or channel growing out of your stomach, you could see into the future. And that's a form of time travel, right?
Not if you chose to stay within God's channel...
Not until like... eighth grade.
I can do anything I want... and so can you...
You should already know that.  Watch the movie, Donnie. I have something to show you.
Go home. Go home and tell your parents that everything is going to be just fine.
Hey...
He fled. They still can't find him.  My mom and I had to change our names and stuff. I thought Gretchen sounded kind of cool.
Why?
With, like, images?
What?
She wrote it.  There are chapters in this book that describe the stuff I've been seeing. It can't just be a coincidence.  Will you come see her with me?
Maybe she's asleep.
The whole movie. Let's go.
Where is she?
But you're OK?
There's something you have to know, Gretchen.  Everything is going to be just fine.
No, a year of partying is enough. She'll be going to Harvard this fall.
Fine. You know, Dr. Thurman isn't so bad a lady. I can tell her anything.
It was great. We had peanut-butter sandwiches and apples and honey at snacktime. And then during show-and- tell, my stuffed walrus was a big hit.
Do they know yet?
Where it came from?
I guess she just lost faith in the world.
A lot of people. Teachers. Younger kids. It's like they're afraid of me for some reason.  But that's OK... because I know I deserve it.
Why should we care?
Why should I mourn for a rabbit like it was a human?
Sometimes it's the only thing that keeps us going.
How so?
I don't own a television.
He said to follow him.
Into the future.  Then he said that the world was coming to an end.
I just turn the volume down and think about fucking Alyssa Milano.
No, I don't think about fucking my family. That's sick!
Four times... so far.
I don't know. Gretchen has a theory. That Frank is a sign. I told her I thought it was ridiculous.
No. That makes you keep searching.
I... I was playing with fire.
What did you want for Christmas that year?
If God exists?
Where are we going?
Maybe you'd like to tell Mom and Dad why you stopped taking your medication.
You're not gonna tell Mom, are you?
Well, don't worry... I'm taking my medication.
I was just being honest.
Well, I think you're the fucking Anti-Christ.
Frank?
You're telling me my son has an imaginary friend?
Frankie Feedler. You remember him from high school?
If you think Michael Dukakis will provide for this country prior to the point when you decide to squeeze one out, then I think you're misinformed.
Don't worry, Mom. Just go, you'll miss your flight.
Yep.
I think we've all seen "Bonanza".
You know, there's, like, this rule. We get to go home at 7:55.
I don't know. I just didn't wanna win like this.
Okay.
This came for you, sweetie.
Airport Ho-Jo!
I'm sorry. They're just starin'.
I -- I -- I -- I -- I --, j-uh-j-uh- just wanted to compe-e-e-e-ete.
Your parents'd kill you.
Yah?
Huh?
They're from L.A. They wanted to see my room and film me for their movie.
Ruined a brand-new pair of Lee Press- ons.  Well, I sat down for a beer and KA- BLEWEY! Next thing I know, somethin' blows through my kitchen window. Next thing I know, I'm ass up in Loretta's flower bed.
I ain't lettin' go ktil you tell me what's up. I'm reaching' a point where I'd kill someone for the nicotine on their fingernails.
Let me tell you "scary," Amber. Look at me. Do you wanna look like you been rode hard and put away wet at my age? I'm a "lifer" here. Best I can hope for is to end up in a descent "raisin ranch" where they'll change me twice a day.
No, wait. It -- it was here before the openin' number... wait. What am I sayin'? I should just ask you, Becky. Where is it?
Bitch!
Yes...
I know.
Oh, naw. Hi.
Why don't you paint a big red target on your ass, Loretta.
She's the winner and we're going to state.
My dress'll reek.
Correction. This spunky monkey on my right is Terry Macey. And we are your Minnesota American Teen Princess State Board.
Tammy Curry?
We're not in the showroom, Dear.
Yah -- Gladys had me order that swan special made from Mexico  in case Becky won. I do a lotta business with those people. I always offer to pay 'em in tacos.  Whoo, they love that.
That's why we Lutherans use grape Koolaid for the blood of Christ.
It's always hard to see the young ones called home, especially on an exploding thresher. It's just so odd and gross.
Okay, everybody, listen up!
Don't make me kick-ya where the good Lord split-ya.
English! English, you stupid little retard! We America now, Tina!
What, you deaf? I say shut up -- shut up -- SHUT UP!  Cut her outta this!
The President of the United States.
"My dear President"...
"My dear"...
"My President"...
Send for my car...
Never mind His Excellency -- you gotta your pocketbook?
Yeh, he's only got one eye.
Did you shoot the rapids?
In that case you'll have to take a civil service examination --  if you pass I'll put you in the post-office -- stick out your tongue.
Sure, that's easy.  You gotta insult somebody.
By the way, are you sure we need a spy?
We've gotta have somebody who knows how to get secrets from men.  You know how to make love?
That's not bad for any day.
I don't know about us, but I know he's-a got something...
I've gotta five thousand men but no horses.
Fine - keep on yelling - Do everything you can to disturb Firefly - Now what about your cousin?
So everyone beware Who's crooked or unfair; No one must take a bit of graft Unless he gets his share. 
Tired!  I'd like to stretch this into a week -
$50?
Your Excellency, haven't we met before?
Go ahead.
Can't we go some place where we can be alone?
Well, why not say the least and get it over with?
You worm!
Yes.
Bah!! 
Well, I won't stand for much.  And I won't stand for you if you don't show some improvement soon.  Look at your report card last month -- "D" in spelling...  six in behavior. Now who were the six?  A fine state of affairs -- no wonder you can't matriculate, now what were you saying?
That's all right.  I'll fix you right up.
THIS IS TREASON!!  What a fool I was to listen to your siren song and fall a helpless victim under the insidious spell of your irresistible charms --
What is money?  Mrs. Teasdale, for you -- I would do anything.
Mrs. Teasdale -- no matter who rules Freedonia, to me you will always be the first lady of the land.
Oh, would you...?
That's where you come in.  I'll leave him in your hands, and don't forget you're supposed to be my niece.
My dear niece -- I must ask you not to interfere.  War is not a woman's problem.
Yes, very well, I think. Are the girls in bed?
No, I think a whiskey.
I shouldn't be. We made great progress today. I taught him to repeat a few basic phrases. He did rather well, too, but I had to lead him every step of the way. Though frankly, at times I was unsure of who was leading whom.
And what qualities are those? Intelligence or stupidity?
And here are my mother and father.
Yes?
What is it?
I'll get my bag.
He's sick, Bytes. He's going to die.
He's doing very well. In fact that's why I came to see you. I think that if I were to present Mr. Merrick to the hospital committee, then they would have a chance to see for themselves not only the extraordinary nature of the disease, but of the man as well. If the committee had a chance to speak with him, hear him say a few words for himself, I'm sure they would see him as a patient, rather than as a violation of the rules.
...Yes, Sir.
Fine, fine. You know, your dedication to this patient is an inspiring thing, Treves. But you must remember that this is a hospital, and there are many patients here. Patients who can be made well, and you owe them your first consideration. Just don't become so obsessed, old man, that you begin to neglect them.
Yes, I think I can.
Do you think they'll go along with us?
No, we don't. Their committees have informed me that they're unwilling to take Mr. Merrick, even if they were supplied with funds. They don't want him.
Steady on, Treves. Have a seat.
Everyone has been very kind. I am extremely grateful.
Your majesty shall mock at me; I cannot speak your England.
Oh no, Mr. Merrick. I just work there.
It's very difficult to put into a nutshell, but I should say the theater is the shrine of the imagination, where one may suspend disbelief and travel anywhere in the world, to any time you desire. You may look over the shoulders of kings, unobserved, battle with ruthless tyrants, and marry the beautiful princess, all in the space of a few hours. Onstage you may be whoever you wish to be, do anything you please, and always, always live happily ever after. The theatre is all the brightest and best things of the world, Mr. Merrick. It is lights and music, gaiety and joy. It's... well, it's romance.
I'm very grateful to you, Mrs. Kendal. This is just the thing to help him forget his ordeal. John will be very excited.
And yet, not once have any of us heard him complain.
You're English.
Yes.
Yes.
The main spire.
Yes John!
Yyyess.
John Merrick.
Say "Mmmerrick."
Hello, my name is John Merrick.
You did not ask me.
I'm not used to such kindness. From a beautiful woman.
That's a canopy, John.
Of course.
Good morning.
Oh no! There is nothing! I have everything, you have given me everything I could possibly want. I am happy every hour of the day. I only wish there was something I could give to you.
You don't think it's too gaudy, do you?
There is one more thing, John. Here.
Oh, Mr. Treves. Mr. Treves.
Fine.
We've made tremendous strides today, Mothershead. He listens and repeats with great attention, and this certainly isn't easy for him.
A dressing bag.
Welcome home, John.
And who might you be, sir?
Handsomely?... Who sent you?
Never mind. I'm the owner.
There's nobody here, Father. Look for yourself.
But, Father, it IS!
Well, of course. We always welcome friends.
And I thought you said it was something special...
Five this week; how many the week before?
And the week before that?
Goodbye, Aud...
No... no...
Halfdan wanted to stop you waking the Gods... so... I disguised myself to sabotage their plans.
We blew the Horn Resounding.
It is day, of course, Freya.
You're just saying that.
Right! Summon the musicians! We'll do the one that goes "TUM-TUM-TUM- TUM-TI-TUM-TUM"
No, no... It was very... er, nice.
Yes?
You've got to let me go!
Why?
Don't talk nonsense.
Yes... oh, yes...
The important thing is not to panic.
Yes.
Sh!
What -- rape?
What?
Well you started it.
And I was just saying that rape is no MORE pointless or crude than all the killing and looting that goes on.
Why... should YOU care?
What's the point of being dead in the land of the living?
Find it... AND cross it!
But...
No.
I know!
I know. I know.
She got me thinking...
Sorry!
Shut up. You there. You there and you there.
No! We'd be the first living men to set foot in the Halls of the Gods.
To the oars!
I've got you!
What's the matter with Bjorn?
What is it?
What if we could find Bi-Frost the Rainbow Bridge?
It doesn't matter WHERE you sit!
You will wait?
He hasn't.
I thought I might do a bit of business on the way.
Thorbjorn Vifilsson's wife became a Buddhist, not a Christian.
Olaf Tryggvason used to throw up on every single voyage... the whole time... non-stop... puke... puke... puke.
Bastard.
That's it! AND you keep wanting to go to the lavatory.
I've got you, Keitel Blacksmith. If you go... I go too...
What are you doing, Keitel Blacksmith?
Can't make enough swords!
That's right.
You can't let Erik do THAT.
I KNOW! I'VE HEARD IT ALL 1 THOUSAND TIMES!
It's no good going berserk against a dragon!
Sh!
GIVE US A CHANCE, Dad!
Me too.
Yes, Mother.
Yes, Mother. Goodbye, Dad.
They can't erase memories. It's a joke. It's a nasty Clementine hoax.
I did. You said, things were fine.
Anyhoo, sweetie, I done a bad thing. I kinda sorta wrecked your car...
No, I don't want to bug you if you're trying to --
Well, I'm there. I hide in the back as much as is humanly possible. You have a cell phone? I need to quit right this minute. I'll call in dead.
I'll go on the dole. Like my daddy before me.
Exactly! Tom Waits. Which song?
Purple Haze, Pink Eraser.
Someone's got that job.  Agent Orange! I came up with that one. Anyway, there are endless color possibilities and I'd be great at it.
I think. Anyway, I've tried all their colors. More than once. I'm getting too old for this. But it keeps me from having to develop an actual personality. I apply my personality in a paste. You?
Yeah, I got it.
I don't know any jokes about your name.
I don't know what that means.
I'm not nuts.
Oh. I don't know. I was just... I don't know. I was... You seemed nice, so --
Okay.
Yes?
That's okay.
It's okay. I didn't think you were.
Yeah? I can't remember that album very well. I remember liking it. But --
I'm fine.
No, I'm okay for now.
I know a man who needs a refill.
Oh.  Does that make you sad? Or anxious? I'm always anxious thinking I'm not living my life to the fullest, y'know? Taking advantage of every possibility? Just making sure that I'm not wasting one second of the little time I have.
When?
It's you! It's you who can't commit to anything! You have no idea how lucky you are I'm interested in you! I don't even know why I am! I should just end it right here, Joel. Leave you in the zoo. Maybe you could find a nice sloth to hang out with!
You're a whiz kid. So perceptive, so --
Yeah, Tangerine?
I hired them to. We're in my brain. But I want it to stop, before I wake up and don't know you anymore.
I don't know.
I loved you so much this day. On my bed in your panties. I remember I thought, how impossibly lucky am I to have you on my bed in your panties.
I love it!
Sorry to track you down like this. I'm not a stalker. But I needed to see you.
Not yet. Not married.
I remember that speech really well.
yeah?
Did this conversation come before or after we saw the house?
I hesitated for what seemed like forever.
I walked out the door. There's no more memory.
I love you.
That's what it says. You drank too much, you picked on me for being passive and timid.
I sort of do. But I only see it as a fantasy version of reality. Cleaned up enough to be erotic.
What old mill? Is that somewhere we --
I know. I spoke to my friend Magda.
Good. I called you at work today. They said you were home sick.
I'm like a joke to them.
That's your look for me.
Oh, God. I miss her. I can't believe she's with that guy now! I'm never going to see her again. I love her so much. What a fucking monster she is!
I wasn't going to call her. Not after the way she was.
Is that like us? Are we just bored with each other?
I loved you on this day. I love this memory. The rain. Us just hanging.
On the couch. Dark. Quiet. I wondered if I had made a terrible mistake. I almost reached for the phone about a thousand times. I thought I could take it back, erase it, explain I had momentarily lost my mind. Then I told myself we weren't happy. That was the truth. That what we were was safe. It was unfair to you and to me to stay in a relationship for that reason. I thought about Clementine and the spark when I was with her, but then I thought what you and I had was real and adult and therefore significant even if it wasn't much fun. But I wanted fun. I saw other people having fun and I wanted it. Then I thought fun is a lie, that no one is really having fun; I'm being suckered by advertising and movie bullshit... then I thought maybe not, maybe not. And then I thought, as I always do at this point in my argument, about dying.
Next thing I remember we were walking down near the surf.
I couldn't believe you did that. I was paralyzed with fear.
Is there any sort of risk of brain damage?
You have to stop this!
I'm trapped in my head and everything I love is being erased! Stop it now!
You take it. I don't know.
Y'know, we've been, I don't know, sort of, unhappy with each other and --
I think maybe, we're both so used to operating at this level that -- How can one person be unhappy? If one person is unhappy, both have to be... by definition.
No. I just need some space, maybe.
Go back to sleep.
It's been a pretty lonely couple of years.
Hi, Mary. How's it going?
Sorry. I just --
I better do this, Stan.
What?
Well, what should we do?
Do you swear you didn't know?
And you never even suspected? Never saw us behaving in any unusual way together?
Do you remember anything else? What I was wearing? Was I standing close to him? Was I leaning against his car like I owned it? How did he look at me when I giggled? Tell me everything.
Nothing.
Welcome, Howard.
Is that Nietzsche?
Alexander Pope?
I didn't make you. You thought it best.  But, look, I take full responsibility.
He went home sick.
She came to help, Howard.
Jesus.
You can if you want.
She was unconscious, Patrick.
Save your breath for the climb.
Neither do I... ha ha ho ho hee hee.
Easy come, easy go.
How am I going to be the progenitor of a tribe when I'm living on an isolated ridgetop with Delores?
I'm staying with the Countess.
Oh, Rupert and Carla had a little hassle and went home.
About...
What is Debbie's position?
She always leaves town, you dummy. That doesn't mean anything. What about in bed? How does she like it in bed?
Well.... er...
I suppose it was mine. Yes, it definitely was my fault.
If we Ivy Leaguers aren't earthy enough to suit you hillbillies, at least we don't go around indulging in racist terms such as 'Chink.' Next thing I know, you'll be calling me 'chief.'
I have to go, Julian.
Tired...
Bonanza Jellybean?
Now, now. Don't get exasperated. I realize that you've always avoided all but the most rudimentary involvements with men, and I might add, you've been wise. Heterosexual relationships seem to lead only to marriage. For men, marriage is a matter of efficient logistics: The male gets his food, bed, laundry, TV, pussy, offspring and creature comforts all under one roof, where he doesn't have to dissipate his psychic energy thinking about them too much, then he is free to go out and fight the battles of life, which is what existence is all about. But for a woman marriage is surrender.
What makes you think this watercolorist and I would develop a romantic relationship?
I'm in the Second Containment area. It's pitch black in here. There must have been a coolant leak. Man, this shit is everywhere. I can't see a damn thing.
You can call him Baby-bear, he loves that...
EVERYBODY SHUT UP! Let the man speak.
You've had plenty EVA, Coop, it's Justin's turn. Stay on station. If anything happens...
I'll get him.
On my way.
You prep the gravity couches. I'm going to manually arm those explosives.
No, thank you.
Skipper, do we get hazard pay for this?
No, he didn't.
It is not.
You're okay now, it's over...
There must be a way! What about Engineering?
Run!
No.
I've been listening to the transmission. And I think Houston made a mistake in the translation.
It's not a distress call. It's a warning.
What happened?
You didn't hear it? You must have heard it!
A written briefing can't possibly anticipate the variables on a mission like this. I have to go with them.
You don't just dismiss Bill Weir. The man held Oppenheimer's chair at Princeton. If the Event Horizon had worked, he would have gone down in history as the greatest mind in physics since Einstein.
The Lewis and Clark just returned from patrol in the asteroid belt, she's docked in bay four.
It won't stop, it goes on and on and on...
Starck!
How do you know all this?
That's the Second Containment Seal. Beyond that, engineering.
Almost done, I just gotta check one thing...
Justin.
What you got, Peters?
...you okay?
I can use the station in Medical, keep an eye on Justin...
The clock is running, Dr. Weir. If you'll follow the rest of the crew, they'll show you to the gravity tanks.
Until then, do what you're told and stay out of my way.
Peters and I will search the forward decks. Justin, take Engineering. No hot-dogging, not on this one, alright?
In an emergency, the charges detonate in series, destroying the central section and separating the personnel areas from the rest of the ship. That way, if the gravity drive malfunctions, the crew could use the foredecks as a lifeboat.
Dr. Weir's right. Get on board the Event Horizon. I'll meet you at the airlock.
One of my men is down. I want to know what happened to him.
It's possible that a burst of gravity waves escaped from the Core, distorting space-time. They could be what hit the Lewis and Clark.
The Event Horizon's computer think's it's 2034.
Intense gravitational fields effect the passage of time, it's possible...  Black holes make sense on paper, it's all math, you see, but as to what really happened...  The Event Horizon has passed beyond our plane of reality, and like Lazarus, returned from the dead.
Thermal changes in the hull could have caused the metal to expand and contract very suddenly, causing reverberations --
Just get your gear back onto the Lewis and Clark, doctor, or you'll find yourself looking for a ride home.
Son of a bitch!
What makes you think I'll miss?
Then who the fuck are you?
You're lying...!
...Make your approach vector negative fourteen degrees...
Love to.
You heard me, Smith. Peters, are you with me?
I'm here, Smith, how's the Clark?
Carbon dioxide?
What's causing the readings?
So where is the rest of the crew? We've been over every inch of this ship and all we've found is blood. Dr. Weir? Any suggestions?
Whatever was on that bridge wasn't Weir.
Yes.
DJ!  It's okay. You're okay. Just breathe.
I did.
Not according to the computer.
Thank you for that scientific analysis, Mister Smith.
The law of relativity prohibits faster- than-light travel...
Range 3000 meters and closing.
1000 meters...
Picking up magnetic interference.
Explosive decompression.
How?
Do they have pressure?
I can't believe we built this.
Yes.
I'm alright. Please.
It means nothing.
You wouldn't say that, if you could see me.
"Sensual blind chick seeks three- ton, rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual relationship."
Tell me. When you grew up in Brooklyn, how many astronauts did you know?  You went your own way then. You didn't listen to people. So why start now...?
Is it safe?
I'm worried about you.
What is this? Where's Reed?
To help you. I've run every test known to man. And they all yield the same result: the machine is ready.
Five times.
I think I need to lie down. Bad shrimp.
Yeah, nine years straight.
Forget it, egghead. I'm good as is.
They're fine. Everybody else... is fine.
Really? With a name like Von Doom? Never saw that one coming.
Hey, I'm Mr. Sensitivity now.  Clear the way, wide load coming through.
I don't know if "we've" noticed, but the sickest runs this side of the Alps are right outside that window --
I've never felt better in my life. When do you get off work?
Meet me at 4:01, top of the run. That'll give you a minute to freshen up.
The cloud has fundamentally altered our DNA.
Gotcha. Okay. Supernova bad.
Right, whatever, have fun.
But all these people...
Please tell me you go silent too.
Okay, "mom."
I think that thing is Ben.
Blockhead started it!
Yeah, for the last time, I hope. I'm done with this freak show. I'm moving back to the real world.
Look around, sis! She's not here. So you can stop talking to me like I'm your little boy --
Top left, like you asked.  Today Wall Street. Tomorrow, who knows... maybe Washington.
Never better.
Well, he's welcome to ride shotgun, but we already have a pilot on our payroll. You remember my brother Johnny...
You always had a way with words.  I should be getting back.
You are such a dork, Reed... You never got it and never will unless it's explained to you in quantum physics.
What? What do you mean you --
Let's not jump to conclusions, we need a massive amount of evidence before making that leap.
We need to get past them.
Anger. Rage. Frustration.
I'm sure I can come up with something.
You were?
I did. I did, Reed... but I wanted you to be that man.
A gasket? Reed, we're at a party.
Not at all.
Which is precisely the point. Analysis is over. It's time for action. My men could have mass-produced this by now.
I understand the business reasons.
Sue, I've lived my life unafraid of taking big steps. And this is the biggest step yet. If it helps, think of this as a promotion. A merger of sorts...  Four little words that can change our lives...
Victor, are you feeling alright?
Just find him.
It is. There's something we need to talk about. Something I need to ask you...
Same old Reed. All analysis, no action. Wasn't that the problem with you two?
Arnold. What's happening?
Brad. I don't want to have to use sex as a tool.
I don't want to talk about it here, Brad.
Look, Brad, I've been trying to think of a way to tell you this. We're almost out of high school, this is our last year. I think we owe it to ourselves to be free, and meet some new people. Then, if we get back together, we'll know it's the right thing.
Come on, Spicoli. Why don't you just put your shirts back on? See the sign?
First door on your left!
I thought I'd take it off for the drive over to IBM. It's kind of uncomfortable.
I am so tired. I am so tired of dealing with morons. How hard is it to...
I don't care it you tell me or not. I got problems of my own.
I've been doing some thinking. It's my last school year. I'm a single, successful guy. I think I want my freedom.
Where did you hear that?
Dad says!
Go away, Curtis. If you can't knock, I can't hear you.
Mark is a really nice boy...
I don't know.
He's my friend, too.
So are you.  Are you shaking?
Let's continue.
What? Are you all right?
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
I think I came. Didn't you feel it?
Mike, there's something that's been on my mind and I have to tell you about it.
We've got to get an abortion?
What do you mean -- wuss? This girl is my exact type. It's her. Definitely her.
Damone, you gotta listen to me.
The Attitude? The Attitude dictates that you don't care if she comes, stays, lays or prays. Whatever happens, your toes are still tappin'. When you are the cruelest and the coolest... then you have The Attitude.
Yeah?
I think I've got it. Once I get going, I'll be okay. But... how do I get started? I mean, I hardly know her.
Damone. It's Mark.
No. It's too late. The food is coming and everything. Damone, I've got to ask you this favor, and I'll never ask you for anything again in this lifetime or any other. Will you please borrow your mom's car, go by my house, get my wallet, and meet me back here?
I always stick up for you. Whenever people say 'Aw, that Damone is a loudmouth' -- and they say that a lot -- I say 'You just don't know Damone.' When someone says you're an idiot, I tell them 'Damone's not an idiot. You just don't know him.' Well, you know, Damone, maybe they do know you pretty good. And I'm just finding out.
You're crazy. Those girls love me.
And they don't call my parents?
Okay. Thanks a lot, Linda.
That's me, Merv.
Totally.
Naw. Any good?
Just be glad you're all right.
Yeah, but I fucked up. You can take it. Really.
Listen, Stace, you want to know about guys? I'll tell you. They're mostly chicken. Before I met Doug I chased after every guy I thought was cute. I thought if I gave out a vibe they'd get the message and call me up. Well, guess what? They don't call.
Really?
I know.
What do you mean 'better in bed.' You either do it or you don't.
What variables?
Oh! That's where that group got its name from.
I think Christmas brings out the worst in people.
God, I don't think so. Better look in the house.
I don't know... I just don't feel right.
I'm not going to tell him. He's an asshole. I hate him.
There goes your stereo for another year. Mike Damone is a no-brain little prick. I'm not letting him get away with this.
Stacy, he's not a guy.  He's a little prick!
Romance in Ridgemont? We don't even get cable TV.
He's not coming.
I didn't tell anyone I applied cause I never thought I'd make it.
There's a world of guys out there. I just wish I didn't have to date any of them.
What class?
Really?
Oh, please. I get so lonely when that third attendance bell rings and I don't see all my kids here.
That's the name they gave me.
Yes.
Food will be eaten on your time!  Why are you continuously late for this class, Mr. Spicoli? Why do you shamelessly waste my time like this?
Hey, it's in my locker, Mr. Hand.
Aloha, Spicoli.
I know, everyone says that.
Thanks. So do you.
I don't know. Wherever you want.
Yes... I am really nineteen.
What about those other guys you live with?
We keep them, in case the people come back.
My other question is... can-I-have your-phone-number-so-I-can-ask-you out-sometime?
Not at all.
Two more Cokes.
Me, too. I'm real sorry someone broke in and stole your tape deck.
Thanks. So...  What do you want to do?
I'll get you the notes.
Yeah. I want you to have this picture, so you won't forget what I look like. And so you'll remember to call me over the summer.
Two Cokes.
Righto!
Crying? Why was she crying?
Don't worry. You're protected. Just treat this poor woman like you'd treat any other human being in trouble.
Of course. And now I have to get back to the news. Send up some ice.
Witchcraft? Shit, you can't mean it!
Naw! Not a major.
You know what I mean. We've done it before and we can damn well do it again!
Las Vegas.
I know. I'm a triple Scorpio.
Jesus! Did I say that?
Indeed. We must do it. What kind of story is this?
My heart!
No, no. Don't leave me!
How about "Nickel Nick's Slot Arcade?" "Hot Slots," that sounds heavy. Twenty- nine cent hotdogs...
Dogs fucked the Pope, no fault of mine. Watch out!... Why money? My name is Brinks; I was born... Born?
OK. Lets pay this bill and get up very slowly. It's going to be a long walk. 
Probably the bartender. He wanted to stomp you for what you said to the waitress.
They didn't have any. They don't grow in the desert.
Look you better put that blade away and get your head straight. I have to put the car in the lot.
I dig my own graves. Green water and the White Rabbit. Put it on.
Do it! I want to get HIGHER!
I figure she can do about four at a time. Christ, if we keep her full of acid that's more like two grand a day. Maybe three.
We have to cut her loose. She's got two hundred dollars. And we can always call the cops up there in Montana, where she lives, and turn her in.
Just the other day we had a case where they grabbed a girl right out of a McDonald's hamburger stand. She was a waitress, about sixteen years old... with a lot of people watching, too!
...and every one of them stacked naked...
Hurry up with those drinks. We're thirsty. Only two rums. Make mine a Bloody Mary.
Lucy is looking for you.
It's gone too far.
Hi, Lucy?  Yeah, it's me. I got your message... what? Hell, no, I taught the bastard a lesson he'll never forget... what?  No, not dead, but he won't be bothering anybody for a while. Yeah. I left him out there, I stomped him, then pulled all his teeth out...
Jesus... what kind of monster client have you picked up this time? There's only one source for this stuff -- the adrenaline gland from a living human body!
Right!
Yes!
We had abused every rule that Vegas lived by -- burning the locals, abusing the tourists, terrifying the help. The only chance now, I felt, was the possibility that we'd gone to such excess that nobody in the position to bring the hammer down on us could possibility believe it.
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST!
No! I swear I'm not!
I fear nothing.
One phone call every day. Just tell us what you've seen. Don't worry if it doesn't add up, that's our problem.
They'll get in! We'll all die!
We can't risk letting them in.
Don't be stupid, drop the gun!
Yeah.
Hey. You noticed that no one's been killed or maimed for awhile?
We're lucky to be alive.
C'mon guys--
Where's that?
Well, your last words can be "I told you so."
And the rest of 'em?
No, no, no it was... it was wild out there, no time to think, we just moved. He didn't leave me. He just ran.  He just ran.
Just move!
The door... on three.
Well then I guess we should just give up.
He's dead.
My truck.
Just cover me. It was built to move.
No, no, it calms you, makes everything nice and smooth. Just takes the edge off like a beer, but in a fraction of the time.
But --
Okay then.
You don't understand sweety, Daddy doesn't pay, Daddy sees the show for free. But you do get points for being horny on a night like this.
Huh?
Covered.
Holds four.
Seven.
What!? So you can just get the hell outta here and forget about all of us!? No way! That's my god damn truck!
I don't trust you. No way! I pick who goes! And I'm holding you responsible.
Whoa!
Oh? And what's that?
I think that's for bears and sharks, chunky chew.
What the hell's going on here!?
HOLD THAT TIGHT!
What?
MOVE YOUR ASS!
Right. Were going to need some fire power.  Do you have any sort of guns or ammunition here? Anything at all?
And the last one is the...
Whoa!
I'm fine, I really am.
Deal.
I just hit it like you said.
But we've been at it since six this morning. At least you could've let me go home and change.
'Forgive'...? For What?
You see: We've got to change that name.
Thank you.
Really, Mr. Clurman, you don't have to sell me.
Showdown.
No?
I gotta go now.
I'm afraid not. You see, we observe things that you're unaware of: signs, indicators. Your problem cuts very deep, Frances, and we have to get at that deeper stuff so that when you do get out, you'll really feel secure. Does that make sense?
We'll talk more about this. I'll see you later.
...No, Ralph. I don't believe I ever was sick. But when you're treated like a patient long enough, you're apt to act like one...
Is Kaminski a Communist?
Francie, you'll learn that sometimes it's best to stay low and just walk away.
You really want to go?
Be careful, Francie.
I don't know, honey. Your mother has such big plans for you.
What you have to understand, Francie, is that she... well... she wanted so much for herself too, and for me, and she never really got to... The only time I ever saw her happy was if her name was in the papers... but she could have been... if times were different she could have been a politician or... I don't know.
I don't care, Dad. I love you.
No, Lil. It's just you can't understand their brand of patriotism.
Good.
No, No arguments. Be my good girl and go. There's a forest, a burning forest, and you know what I have to do!
Why, you... you little bastard!
You're wasting your time, lady. Nothing's off the record with me.
Now wait a minute, sweetie. Do I look like a newshound to you?
Now you're catchin' on. Don't wanna get your Daddy in hot water, do you?
Well... see the papers've got us pegged as pinkos, then you come along, the friendly neighborhood atheist --
Well... I'll give it a try, Mr. York.
What happened to him?
Since when do you believe the papers? They killed him, kid.
Eight stories.
I always told ya, Frances. You got real ability.
Yeah.
Dick... and my mother! She acts like she's on Mars or something --
Yeah, if I don't make too big an ass of myself.
I know.
Calm down, Frances.
Animal magnetism!  No ginger beer. What's this red stuff?
For not chopping off his head and serving it to me on a platter.
Who said I was a lady?
Look, Frances, I'm only gonna ask this one time. I mean it. I swear after this, I'll never ask again: Will you marry me?
Who?
I know, but... There were so many people in there, Harry. Every time I turned around someone was pressing against me... watching, looking over my shoulder, touching me, grabbing, sticking things into me. When I feel somebody near me now... anybody... my skin starts to crawl.
Yes you do. If you love me you can wait, right? A month, six months, whatever it takes.
Fine, thank you. Did you watch the show?
Wherever they're going, I'm going.
Well, I was picking fruit with some migrant workers until...
What'd you do?
Who're you?
You're Farmer? Oh... Well, look, they took your stuff out. Moved it to some hotel, I think.
'Golden Boy.'
I know, but I'm not seeing it. It's there, Frances, the fire is there, but it's not coming through. You're lazy --
I need an incendiary! An arsonist!
Your big speech?
...You will.
Where are you going?
Not long.
Yes, Mama.
You want to throw it all away, is that it? You had everything, little sister. Beauty... a brilliant career... a wonderful husband. You were a movie star!
Yes, I am, and you can't stop me! You can't tell me what to do, mother. I'm a grown woman, and I can decide about my own life.
No. No, it all depends on what offers I get.
Do you really believe your mother's trying to kill you?
But you tell me you had a pleasant visit and your mother says you were sullen and uncommunicative. Whom do you think I should believe?
Dr. Symington, how big is your dick?
Sedate her.
No! No!
What?
Yes.
I'm... very, very ugly. People are afraid. Except you.
How dare you. You're disgusting and evil.
A companion. A female. Like me, so she won't hate me.
A brain. Extremities.
SHE'LL NEVER BE YOURS! SHE SAID MY NAME! SHE REMEMBERS!
And you look so lovely.
Elizabeth. If it's true, travel into Germany would be banned. You'd never get near Ingolstadt.  Besides, they're only rumors.
Read him one of the old letters and rephrase it. We'll say it came today. It'll set his mind at ease.
It's far too late for him to still be out.
He needs to vent his outrage to the skies! Make yourself heard, Willie! Learning to walk is not an easy thing! Why should it be so?
I wish to be your husband.
Then come with me to Ingolstadt. Marry me now.
A month at most, that's all I ask.  Elizabeth, please. Things have not yet resolved. I must take steps to see that they do. For our family's sake. For our sake.  You are life itself. We shall seal our vow. The moment I am done.
Why the change? What about your work?
Do you foresee this happening in our lifetimes?
Very well then.
You're a comfort to me, Henry.
It's a letter to my father.
But you haven't listened, Never in history has so much seemed possible. We're on the verge of answers undreamt of... but only if we have the courage to ask the questions.
Nothing in moderation, Clerval.
Blasphemy be damned! Waldman spent his life trying to help people!
Is that your diagnosis?
You've been going round-the-clock?
You disdain accepted wisdom?
Why?
Good night, Brenda.
Push on this side. Alice, this is Jack, Marcie and Ned. Push.
You told her to sweep the courts.
You okay?
You're right. It makes no sense.
Artist.
Bad bulb or no power. It's getting a little gloomy in here.
Not if they're where I think they are.
It's over twenty miles to the crossroads. Steve'll be back in an hour. Things will straighten out then. We'll take his Jeep and get help.
Ned? We're gonna be working together for a while. You're a nice guy without all the entertainment, okay?
That was the telephone.
Sometimes I only think about kissing women.
I was just wondering if you thought there'd by any other gorgeous women at Camp Crystal Lake. Besides yourself.
God, but I love that macho talk! Emergency generators! The Indian used campfires.
Good call.
Boy, we sure do have a lot of filthy small-minded people around here.  Wait a minute, I'll get my diaphragm and be right with you.
I don't love Neddy.
Ned!
Yeah, and it also look like it hasn't seen a coat of paint in six years.
Girls can't be cowboys.
No, thanks. I'm fine. Sandy.
One night on the town.
That's thirty percent.
I think water got into the electrical system. You ride me back to camp? I'll get one of my counselors to drive me back tomorrow morning.
Vacation. I'm taking him to see his first bullfight.
Have you ever been there before?
Stop? We're not going to actually stop at a motel, are we?
I'm exhausted.
If trusting you means trusting those fuckin' killers, I can't do that. If you don't tell the cops, I will.
It's not suicide if you're already dead. Two...
What's this about, money?
Just listen to daddy, sugar, and don't do nothin' stupid.  You two, Simon says sit the fuck down!
On the dresser.
My wife.
No. It was a rainy night, the brakes on the car weren't great. She had to stop suddenly. She slid on the road, she crashed, she died.
Not quite. She was trapped in the wreck for about six hours before she passed on.
Real McCoy.
How do I know you'll keep your word?
You want me to sit here and be passive. The only way being passive in this situation makes sense is if I believe you'll let us go. I'm not there yet. You have to convince me you're telling the truth.
No, I didn't.
You won't let him touch her?
Pops, when you're right, you're right, and you are right.
I'm still stewing about that ape laying hands on me. And that fuckin' bartender sticks a weed up my ass, too.
He's smilin' at us. But behind his smile, he's sayin', "Fuck you Jack." I hear that loud and clear.
Nothing. I didn't make a statement. I asked a question. Would you like me to ask it again? Very well. Are you such a loser you can't tell when you've won?  The entire state of Texas, along with the FBI, is looking for you. Did they find you? No. They couldn't. They had every entrance to the border covered. There's no way you could get across. Did you? Yes, you did. You've won, Seth, enjoy it.
You bet your sweet ass you are, and I'm gonna help you do it. But we ain't got much time.
Kate, give your old man a little credit. Every person who chooses the service of God as their life's work has something in common. I don't care if you're a preacher, a priest, a nun, a rabbi or a Buddhist monk. Many, many times during your life you'll look at your reflection in the mirror and ask yourself, am I a fool? We've all done it. I'm not going through a lapse. What I've experienced is closer to awakening. I'm not trying to shake your faith. I've just decided not to devote my life to God anymore.
Mom's got nothing to say, she's dead.
It's a flop house.
Okay, okay, I promise I'll do it!
No!
Anytime.
Not many.
You use 'em on the first couple of these parasites that try to bite you.
Me too.
That's all that's been on the box all day. They killed some people didn't they?
Knock yourself out.
Letting him use your toilet? No store does that.
What? Are you kidding? I didn't do anything!
I wasn't scratching!
Well that don't matter now, 'cause you got about two fuckin' seconds to live! Richie!
I'm not dead, but I'm definitely shot! I told you that bastard said, "Help us!"
What am I supposed to do, Seth? He recognized us.
No.
What?
As long as you don't act like a fuckin' nut, we'll be just fine.
What?
No, I didn't.
Yeah, I think so. What happened?
Really?
Yeah, I guess. I'm just a little fucked up.
No, you're not. You're sippin' margaritas in El Ray. But we're not in El Ray. We're here -- getting ready to go in there. You're so pleased with yourself about getting into Mexico, you think the job's down. It ain't. Get back on the clock. That's a fuck-with-you-bar. We hang around there for a coupla hours, in all likelihood, we'll get fucked with. So get your shit together, brother.
It don't look together.
Thank you, ensign.
Standing right here in my office.
Thank you, sir.  But I expect a certain amount of pain.
Don't worry about it.  If it's off your collar and out of your eyes, that's all I'm going to ask.
I'm not out to change your sex, lieutenant.  You'll have separate beds, separate heads.  If you have specific medical needs, inform the infirmary.  If a classmate or superior acts in an harassing or otherwise unbecoming manner, please inform me immediately so I can deal with it immediately.  Questions?
It's you, sir.  And it started the day I came here.
No, sir.
So I'll get a fair shot?
I don't see how, O'Neil.  Dismissed.
Sir?  What did he say?
Smoke her.
Congress and the Pentagon share a lot of plumbing.  They'll never know whose leak it is.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.  "Land-based maritime specialties." Gimme a second here to de-euphemize that...
That aside for the moment, I'm struck by the tenor, the ill-spirit of your report... the degrading remarks by other aviators... innuendo about her performance in unrelated situations... even a reference to her sexual activity the weekend prior.  In my seven years on this committee, I've never seen a downed aviator treated like this.  Never.  I'm deeply disturbed by this report, Mr. Hayes.  Not just what it bodes for women in the military -- but for your own confirmation as well.
Lieutenant Thomas Wickwire.
Jordan.  Might we do this over lunch tomorrow?  I do very much want to talk, but now is scarcely --
What changed?
What he did was light the bandwagon on fire.  Because he knows what I know -- that American families are not prepared to put their daughters in harm's way.
In face, I do:  Roper, Harris, Gallop -- they all come back the same.
I'm sure it is.
I'll work on it, ma'am.
I can make this wall without --
Flea!  O'Neil!  Why is there a break in that line?
Every class has its surprises, Pyro. This one'll be no different.
She's a women, and that's why you're ridin' her bareback.
I oughtta report you.
What "all females"?  If I'm the only --
I believe he earned it for saving a man's life in Saudi Arabia.  He wanted you to have it.  He was very clear on that point.
Gotta situation here.  Where are you?  Stuck in traffic?
Only four minutes to neutral waters, sir.  Why not?
I feel like there's men here, there's women here -- then there's men.  But hey, what'd I expect?
Jordan.  You watch your ass.
Sounds like an amazing coincidence.
What?
When I was sittin' behind a desk in Washington, it made sense, somehow. Blame it on my big brother.  He was Spec-Recon.  And the stories he used to tell...
Mighta been civilian.
I'm lookin', I'm lookin'!
Educate her, Pyro.
Wasn't deemed a threat.
That's not right.
We didn't know we were compromised. Firing would only've given away our position.
Sure.  Just like your men do.
North?
Darth Vader reads poetry...
The Navy?  They've made it clear they don't want to pull missiles out of subs to make room for women's heads.  What's it gonna cost to make a fleet of Trident's co-ed?
The first female President?
Women.
Shut up. How can you eat like that?
Hey, hey! I'm eating here!
Great. See ya then.
You know how I spent last weekend? Walking his damned dog.
Sure I was. I thought Lucy was gonna kill me.
Perfect! You wanted a story, well, baby, you got one.
It's the maintenance entrance. Runs along the side of the tunnel. When they repaired it last year I worked on a piece about it.
You're crazy, go to the east side and take the park avenue to the JFK.
No.
It's good to see you, Nick.
What?
When you and I use to attend rallies in college, we helped to create awareness. But from the inside now I can actually effect change.  I never lost my idealism.
Yes. The first of its kind. I found this blood sample earlier this evening...
I got pretty close.
So you thought that made it okay to steal my tapes?
Speak of the devil.
That's the problem. He did.
Five bucks.
He said he'd consider it. It's between you and Rodriguez.
Call me Charlie.
Not now. You got my bag?
Listen, this is the time when the big boys have to go to work, okay Honey?
We? I don't think so.
Oh, I'm not married.
Well, I think you're cute.
Nick, my men and I will hold them here. You will have to go and get help!
Have them sealed off.
Excuse me, would you mind telling me what the hell I'm doing here?
It happened so fast no one knew what hit them 'til is was over.
No, it's still in my tent. It's...oh my God, she took it.
But you don't know for sure!
Last time you didn't even scratch it!
Sounds like a big company.
Why are you telling this to me?
So you're in?
Makes us look more American.
Thanks.
Quellek. What are you doing in there?
...Damn you!  Damn you!
... to camera center no matter whose shot you're blocking...
Like throwing gasoline on a fire...
That's your problem.  You were never serious about the caraft...  "I'm a rock... I just want to be a rock... Still. Peaceful.. Tranquil.." ..."Oh, but what's this?  Something's making noise... No, not noise, no... MOVEMENT.  VIBRATIONS.  Make the vibrations stop, they go straight into me like a knife!... I must CRUSH the thing that makes the vibrations..."
I played Richard III...
No. I can't go out there! I won't say that ridiculous catch phrase one more time. I won't.  I can't!
You have a better plan, Alex?
The guy is terminally selfish!
I don't know... It just wasn't like him.
FRONT ARMOR IS GONE! JUST SLOW IT DOWN A LITTLE!
Alex? Where are you going?
Down there.
It's been the subject of an extremely heated debate on the internet for years. Many believe that is a matter collapser, a bomb capable of destroying all matter in the universe in a chain reaction lasting 13 seconds.
Okay, now. But-
Yeah. What's wrong? JASON ~~othIno. I -ust oncuont ot wou~o oc oomooooateo onan onat.
We're getting major structural damage.
Something BAD happened here.
Of course they're cute NOW. But in a second they're going to turn MEAN and UGLY somehow and then there are going to be a million MORE of them!...
Let's just pick up the pace a little, shall we?
Jason, are we doing Episode 31 or not?
You smiled at me.
Are you kidding? I'm not going to tell them.
JASON...
I don't think that's a cloud...
Why does this sound so familiar?
Yes. Yes, I'm here!
Because it was on the show!
This is great!  They're going to start eating each other out there.
I can't...  It's on autopilot!...
Okey dokey, let's fire blue particle cannons full. Fire red particle cannons full. Fire gannet magnets left and right. Fire pulse catapults from all chutes. And throw this thing at him too, killer.
Better than my Lieutenant.  He failed to activate ship's neutron armor as quickly as I'd hoped on our last encounter.
Yes... You understand THAT, don't you, Mathesar?...
Right, If this is about the thing tomorrow you can hammer out the details with my agent, but make sure I have a limo from my house, they jammed me into a Toyota the last time I did one of these
Home.
Yeah. "Earth." Time to get back to "Earth," kids.
Oh, I don't think so. I gave him both barrels.
Thanks
Wherever a distress signal sounds among the stars, we'll be there, this fine ship, this fine crew. Never give up, never surrender!
But... Inside, I have seen-
And determination.
Wh... Where are we?
Just GO! GO! DAMMIT PUNCH GO!
How about the pig-lizard?
It doesn't have eyes.
Pedal to the metal...
Hmmm... she's beneath me, I'm afraid.
I've come to report that we've had a bit of luck!
Congress is talking -- openly -- about replacing you with Lee.
Don't do anything rash, please, Benedict.
Someday, George, you may need to act for the good of the people no matter what Congress thinks that is.  It may come down to us, or them someday.  You or them.  Cicero was right:  was is 'a time when the laws are silent'.
Couldn't you have appealed to Congress?
You are never, never to touch my guns!  Do you understand!?
That you would have known you can trust me.
Then use rocks!
I'll be twenty next year, sir.
It's a wonder they find the British cause worth dying for.
Colonel Hamilton.  Anyone who served under Arnold, I want them shipped north.  I don't want any troops here who served under Arnold.
Did you know that Arnold left the entire defenses of this fort in complete disrepair?  Most of our cannons are so neglected they may as well have been spiked!?  You realize what would happen if this fort fell?  The whole Hudson would be open to them!
No one knows...
March on Philadelphia!  Get Joseph Reed, and the pigs in Congress, the speculators, who've grown fat off the war!  Get them all!  Sweep them aside!
George, we've got to get you out there before we lose our whole army.
Finally!?  It's people like these who, as soon as they get a little power, want more and more.  More ale, here!
It's the political 'cost of doing business', George.
What's the difference?
George!  So good to be back!
Joseph, the British spent thousands of pounds and precious months putting together a fleet that Arnold stopped by sacrificing a heap of old barges.  In my opinion he saved my army.
How many generals do we have like Arnold?  He's got guts -- he's vain, and he fights!
They help me understand why we fight.
My baby daughter has died... my baby... mon petite Henriette...
I'm very aware of that.
What else?  From Virginia?
Don't condescend to me!  We have both of us prospered from the arrangements of our kind...
Yessir!
It isn't my army yet, Colonel Greene.  Looks like you've seen some action -- did you hurt your leg, in a fight?
Sir, Congress hasn't issued their pay for two months, many have not eaten properly for at least that long.  You're being a little hard on them, don't you think?
I'm honored, but, reluctant to leave you.
That's a lie!
I'd throw everything away for you.
I remember a pair of young philosophers once, who laughed at the world.
Sally, our slave system is a British law...
That's just my interpretation. Actually it's a dance designed as a sentiment of courtly manners. You see?  Walk in a gently 'Z'. There are four distinct movements...
Let's get you darker!
I'm lost in ecstasy!  And dost thou love, Thou charming maid?
Just because they are born?
God damn you, Sam Adams!  You wanted a revolutionary army and now that we've really got one it scares you more than it does the British!
An Oldsmobile Silhouette.
They all sound big at the talking stage.
I can't. I got to take Farrah to Satan's place down in Costa Mesa.
Her mother. Not that it matters because I don't work for you no more. I quit. I just wanted to come by, tell you to your face so there's no misunderstanding.
Farrah. Come here.
Just do what I told you and meet me back here at midnight.
The money. Fuck. I gotta think...
No shit? What're some of 'em?
I gave him a key to a locker that had the money in it.
I hear he's around Palm Springs. Dealing our product. Product we sold to you for five hundred thousand dollars.  Why do you keep talking to me bullshit? I think maybe I have Ramon and Ceasar staple your tongue to your chin. What do you think?
Yeah, we're getting Martin.
Harvey Keitel. Yeah. Maybe. He was pretty good in the movie "Fingers".
I'm with you on that. And don't you think it needs a good female part? Increase the romance angle.
In the can. That the money?
Yeah, I hear you bagged Martin Weir for Mr. Lovejoy.
You're gonna just give me five hundred grand?
Leo, I don't know.
Whenever you want it. The money's in hundred dollar bills inside one of those jock bags, you know? In a locker at the airport, waiting to be picked up.
Yeah, I'm here. I just don't like the anonymous crap. It means your either chickenshit or not for real.
Who?
Whatever you want, Ray.
That's right.
Leo spanked a waitress?
Movie producer? Yeah, why not.
I want you to keep looking right here, okay?
Why do I have to keep looking at you?
You just did.
They always paid.
Once.
"Mr. Lovejoy".
Read it. It's a grabber.
Never say anything unless you have to.
Yeah, he wants us to talk to Buddy, set up a meeting.
I found him.
Hey, Bones, looks like you're gonna have a nice scar up there. Maybe these guys can fit you with a rug, cover it up for ya.
A few weeks before shooting, I went back to Bensonhurst, just to listen to you guys. See, I'm Italian, but I grew up in Tarzana. So I wanted to pick up your rhythms of speech.
No, I don't. Though I have to say I'm curious.
I believe it.
Yeah, I like it, I'm high up, I can see everything, you know? It's the Cadillac of minivans.
Compass.
How'd you know I was here?
Sit down, Leo.
You see a black leather jacket, fingertip length, like the one Pacino wore in Serpico? You don't, you owe me three seventy-nine.
I know who he works for. Where's your phone.
What if it was?
How much is the wife offered?
Lemme get this straight, you broke in again to apologize for breaking in before?
Man, can you scream.
I married Martin. That was a full- time job.
He must mean after "Slime Creature 3".
Don't go out of your way.
Right. See how your story ends.
Depends, who pays?
Not unlike the way Nicki met him. Except it was a wrap party. Why?
For starters, Marty wasn't Martin back then.
How 'bout Get Shorty? Except that isn't a movie. That's real life.
You thought I was faking?
Whichever. Let's talk about it tomorrow.
Hey, Chili? Look at me.
Are you going down?
You're as bad as Harry...
Guy's got a fucking pink toilet, for Christ's sake.
I was scared then, not now. How long you want me to be scared?
Don't worry about it. I won't say any more than I have to, if that.
Yeah, well, I'm in L.A. now.
What 'emotion'? Girl just got stabbed in the ear with an ice pick.
Pick 'n' Save.
No. But now that you mention it, I did talk to a handsome executive at Paramount the other day... who just happened to get his hands on the script.
Yeah, well I turned off the set. I used the remote control thing and laid it on the floor. You know what could've happened? The dog came in and stepped on it, turned the TV back on.
Yeah, that's what we need. More agents.
No problem. You go on off to bed.
Really.
I know. I'm doing Shylock instead of a shylock. Okay, what's my motivation? The acquisition of money. To collect. Inflict pain if I have to.
And after all, you have such morals.
A passenger liner. Over.
Arctic Warrior, passenger vessel Chimera was lost at sea day two month two year one nine five three.  Over.
We'll see who's dreamin', m'man.
She's so big somebody could come alongside her on the other side and we'd never know it.
I ain't no mechanic, just so you know.
Maybe you shoulda thought a that before you scuttled our boat.
Lemme see, was that before or after the oil fire?
Amidships starboard at the beam. Just under the waterline. I don't think it's a problem.
Maureen?
Bring it on, dude.
Ever heard of insurance, big boy?
Or uninvited guests.
Thanks for the warning -- Ow! Damn!
Gimme a break.
So we kill him?
A what?
The damn thing's been floating around for God knows how long and it hasn't hit anything yet. So we take it easy. A little of the old push pull.
Sounds reasonable.
How long to fix?
Metal's crystallized. Gotta replace the whole deal.
Hard to say.
It's a full 2500 horses down. We couldn't drag that boat down hill on ice with it.
What do you want me to tell you, that we can throw this sucker back in and start pulling her like nothing happened? Can't do it, skipper.
Man, it gives me the creeps. We got no business towing a ship that size anyway. I say we fix the turbines and hit the highway.
Either way, they must've had a pretty good reason.
And what do you propose? That we knock this guy off?
Yeah, reconsider fucking his shit up.
So whoever did this might still be around.
Not me.
I guess the best strategy's just to tell them the truth.
The radio. Oh, yeah, the radio.
You better get down here right now! We're taking water! Big time!
Right.
Too big. More like a freighter.
Hell, yeah. I like it cold. Colder the better.
Because of the gold.
Better than starving to death.
I didn't sign up to go home empty handed. And I sure ain't gonna roll over for the freaky motherfucker did this.
Salvage fees on a vessel like this could come in around four million bucks. At least. Who knows, could be more. Could be a lot more.  What I'm proposing is... we split it four ways.
Nope.
There's somebody else on this boat.
It wasn't you. It was somebody else. There's somebody else aboard.
I guess that's the sixty four thousand dollar question, isn't it?
I didn't want it to turn out this way.
I think I see it pretty well.
Alright. I'll be right up.
Sorry.
You mean tow her back? That's a thirty thousand ton ship you're talking about.
So we cut her loose and wait it out. A little weather couldn't be anything she hasn't seen before.
Not much at all, I guess. Retire. Live out my golden years and all that.
Moving to Sweden.
We heard you scream. Any idea what you might've seen?
Must've heard something below deck and went down to check it out.
You want fair pay, make hamburger for Mickey D. Otherwise, please to sign.
Please tell me it isn't that teenager!
I dunno... I just like Don Knotts.
Well, I got the idea when I was doing some research and I discovered that Cook's Chicken used to be called Coon's Chicken, and so I decided to do my project based on this discovery as kind of a comment on racism... and the way racism is whitewashed over in our culture...
Well, no - it's more like a "found art object."
I'm not really sure - working, I guess...
As far as I know it includes housing and meals and everything... it is really quite an offer...
But I was only trying to be friendly...
Look, I'll be done in a minute. Just wait outside.
Who, Doug? He spends more time here than I do...
SHH! He's back there. I can see his hair bobbing up and down.
In answer to your question, I suppose I endorse policies that are opposed to stupidity and violence and cruelty in any form...
Hi.
Can I come in?
Why?
Are you trying to get me wasted so you can take advantage of my womanly charms?
Why do you have that stupid poster?
You loser.
This is so bad it's gone past good and back to bad again...
Yeah, I just picked the one that sounded the easiest.
I know, it hasn't really hit me yet.
In fact, never.
Can we call you "Weird Al"?
You loser!
I know, look at the way he drives... he's like an old man.
I'm going to tell him you said that.
Totally! Look!
We should follow him home.
Gross!
I dunno... I kind of like him... He's the exact opposite of everything I really hate... In a way he's such a clueless dork that he's almost cool...
It's always closed...
Let's go hassle Josh.
Hey, you have to see my new good luck charm.
Wait...
Yeah, well...  So when are you going to get your job?
Like what?
I wonder if I hang around with you because you're like my surrogate mother figure or something. Like I have this subconscious biological need to be nagged and bitched at constantly.
He's like the biggest idiot of all time!
Wasn't it like eighth grade?
I told you - my manager was a total asshole! Don't worry, I'm going to get another job... and anyway, I have some ideas for how to make money in the meantime...
Yeah, thanks.
I thought we decided that Josh was way too cool to be interested in sex, and that he's the only decent person left in the world and we would never want to bring him down to our level and all that...
I can't believe it - he actually scored!
So should I come over?
Nothing.
I don't know! God, don't act so jealous I only talked to him for two minutes.
That's all you're bringing?
Make sure you're here by noon - we have tons of stuff to do... Oh yeah! I have to show you something else!
It just came yesterday...
What are you doing here, Melorra?
Oh yeah, like he even noticed.
A mongoose... they eat snakes... you never heard of a mongoose?  That's a classic piece of vintage taxidermy. Nobody alive today knows how to do work like that.
Umm... That's not officially for sale... I might have to hang onto that for the time being.
Seymour does.
It's kind of falling apart.
Get a job!
You're crazy -- it should be like two dollars!
Well why do I care about that?
Nah, it's not so great. Here's the one I'd recommend.
So you really liked it? Yeah, there's some really rare performances. You liked that Memphis Minnie, huh?
I have about fifteen hundred 78s at this point. I've tried to pare down my collection to the essential...
Yeah right... If I'm so cool, why haven't I had a girlfriend in four years? I can't even remember the last time a girl talked to me.
Jesus! That's very nice of you Enid but I - I really --
Jesus!
Fine, I'll go by myself then...
Shh!
I brought it for him to autograph. He's going to be amazed to see it - it's one of two known copies... I can't believe they have him for the opening act and not the headliner. What an insult!
Jesus, Seymour.
Look, I really appreciate your help, Enid, but let's face it, this is hopeless.
But it's not totally hopeless for you... I've had it. I don't even have the energy to try anymore.  You should make sure you do the exact opposite of everything I do so you don't end up like me...
It doesn't matter, I'm not staying long... I just want to make sure I convince you not to give up yet.
Jesus, I'd go nuts if I had to work in an office all day.
Oh... uh, thanks a lot Enid... I really appreciate it...
Are you okay?
I'm starting to think that even if I did get a girlfriend it really wouldn't change anything.
Oh yeah?
I won't even dignify that with a response.
How can you be so sure?
What, are you going to like have sex with her on your first date?
I know, I'm sorry... I-I've been really busy...
Oh... pretty well, surprisingly... you know...
So that's it? You don't ever want to see me again?
What does she mean by that - "somebody like me"?
So, do you like me, Seymour?
Nothing. Don't worry, I won't bother you any more.
I could never move - I've got too much stuff.
Dana bought it when we went antique shopping. She said it didn't go with her stuff, so she gave it to me... she thought it fit in better with my "old time thingamajigs."
What?
I-I-I...
...Do you really want us to drive away somewhere?
They're Seymour's.
I am.
Right, exactly!
She's not at home?
What the fuck is she doing?! She was supposed to be here three hours ago!
Josh!? Why would she be with Josh?
Why? What did she tell you?
What? Is she having some secret affair with Josh?
Didn't she ever tell you about that? God, she really is pathological...
Remember what I said when we first started -- this little breakdown might turn out to be the best thing that ever happened to you!
Yes?
-malaria epidemic; very sudden.
Excellent decision.  Your name is Abdullah? I'm sure we'll meet again. Go and enjoy the splendid morning.
How; we don't know where they are?
My wife is the game player in the family, sir.
You won't have the chance.  Any further words of encouragement?  Then I've a train to catch.
How could it be? I hate Africa.
Yes he is.
In point of fact, it didn't.  But I'm convinced the theory is sound.
I made a mistake hiring you- you're simply not up to the job. 
Karim will have to show me where it happened. And of course, I'll need the donkey.  With any luck, I'll sort it out tonight. 
You never had it.
Well, he got away, didn't he?  Riding a donkey not far from here when the lion sprang on them- donkey took the brunt of it- then suddenly the lion ran off.
We're not much good at goodbyes, Helena.
Have you got that in writing? 
Aren't we full of ourselves today?  I think it's because of the lion.
John, it will not be easy.
-far end of camp- man wandering alone at night. Hawthorne's examining the body now.  There's even less of him than of Singh.
What did I do?
That's very considerate.
It was probably luck- I'd rather you did the shooting.
It's all right. Stay ready.  They know it's there.
Not for me- I'm too bulky and it's your idea, you go up there.  Take the others to the water tower for the night.
This is more difficult-
You don't know what Tsavo means, do you?  It means "slaughter"...
I do, actually; very much.
I don't believe you had a mother. 
No, everything's fine.  Honestly.  Thanks anyway.
I'd rather not.
I'm not saying you did.  In science we always look for the simplest explanation.
Okay, whatever you think -- but not Venkman.
That's a good-looking kid you got there, Ms. Barrett.
You know, Dana, I'm very very hurt that you didn't call me first.  I'm still into all this stuff, you know.  Haven't you ever seen my show?
I'm El Gato.  I always land on my feet.
Thank you.  Poor baby.  I think I should put him down now.
Yes, I'm very clean.  Did they find anything at my apartment?
Now you get dressed and we go out.  I got a babysitter and everything.  Trust me, you need it.
I want to stop getting involved with men who aren't good for me.
Don't worry.  Janine has a very special way with children.
Same difference.
So what?  It's a free country.  Thanks, Lib.
A little to the left.  Right there!  That's where it stopped.
Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else.
No, you can't, and I think that's the whole problem with aliens; you just can't trust them. You may get some nice ones occasionally like Starman or E.T., but most of them turn out to be some kind of lizard.  Anyway, we're just about out of time.  Next week on 'World of the Psychic,' hairless pets.  Until then, this is Peter Venkman saying ...  ... Good night.
Okay.
Oh, Johnny.  Did you back the wrong horse.
Lord Vigo, the mother, Dana, is fine and strong.  I was wondering -- well, would it be possible -- if I bring the baby, could I have the woman?
Okay, let me rephrase that question.  Didn't you once coach a basketball team for underprivileged children?
I can't do it, Louis.  It isn't ethical.  I could lose my license.
This is not just some money-making scheme!  I didn't just make up the date.  I have a strong psychic belief that the world will end on New Year's Eve.
I had my fingers crossed when they swore me in, but I'm going to tell you the truth. There are things in this world that go way beyond human understanding, things that can't be explained and that most people don't want to know about anyway.  That's where we come in.
Yeah, you would.  Is that for personal or professional reasons?
You need the exercise.
A hundred and five years?  He really hung on, didn't he.
This won't wait until tomorrow, Venkman. It's hot and it's ready to pop.
They love you, Lib.  Keep it up.
Some crank.  Looking for goat hooves.  Come up with anything?
This is about as deep as you can go under Manhattan without digging your own hole.
It may be ebbing and flowing from some tidal source.
This guy was a bad monkey.  He dabbled in all the Black Arts, and listen to this prophecy.  Just before his head died, his last words were, "Death is but a door, time is but a window.  I'll be back."
Oh, just checking something for an old friend.
Hey, hey, hey, stresshound!  Are you nuts? If anybody found out about this we'd be in serious trouble.  The judge couldn't have been clearer - no ghostbusting.
We're running tests to see if we can get an equally strong positive reaction.
Okay, but you're missing all the fun.
Good effort.  Now what?  Should we say supportive, nurturing things to it, Ray?
The whole city's together on this one.  We took a vote.  Everybody's down on you, you know.
Oh, right, you told me that.  They came to America seeking other kinds of cheese, as I recall.  How about you, Winston?
It likes all the sappy stuff: 'Cumbaya,' 'Everything is Beautiful,' 'It's a Small World' -- but it loves Jackie Wilson.
I guess he wasn't too popular at the end there.
What?  Yeah.
Groovy.  I've never felt better in my life.
I don't know.  It probably would've been the same.
It is a star!  That's great.  You're very good.
Hi, Louis.
I am Zuul.
Barrett.  Dana Barrett.
It's in the stars.
Really?  Do you have a favorite piece?
That's a violin concerto.
Thanks.  What's in there?
All right.  What do you want to do?
Out!
All right.
Goodbye.
Yes, but I have to tell you in private at a fine restaurant.
"Gozer" -- he was very big in the Sumerian religion.  One of their gods.
I'll pick you up at your place.  I'll bring along the Roylance Guide -- we can read after we eat.
Okay, I'll help you.  Should we make some dip or something?
He's a big one.  You don't want to mess with that particular breed.
Die in what sense?
I don't care.  I see us as tiny parts of a vast organism, like two bacteria living on a rotting speck of dust floating in an infinite void.
I don't believe in luck.
You could say that.
I'm not at liberty to say.
Two wavy lines?
You volunteered, didn't you?  Aren't we paying you for this?
Were you recently in the bathroom?
The wet towels, residual moisture on your lower limbs and hair, the redness in your cheeks indicating ...
I'm always serious.
Yeah, I can smell it.
Does she want to be?
I agree.
Oh, shit!
Neutronize.  System shut.
I need two new purge valves.  How's the grid around the storage facility holding up?
What do we do now?
Maybe.  But no one ever advertised before.
No sense worrying about it now.
So far all we got is a shit smell on the twelfth floor and we almost fried a Puerto Rican bellboy.
Forget the trapping!  Just blast him!
What?  What popped in there?
Yeah, I heard that.  Now tell me what you really do.
Mmmhmmm.
And Caesar!  Let's not forget to serve Caesar!
Maybe you should get married.  Pick one of your cousins, it would demonstrate a profound stability.
I'm sure, I don't know.
You're coming back?
Why are you so surly -- you've won, brother.  The people have bread and the city is quiet.
You want control of the crowd -- you can't get it by killing their hero.
Respectfully Caesar, Quintus and I must report.
Underdog!  How can he be an underdog -- he wins all the time!  I'm the emperor why can't I kill him?  He could be poisoned, or somehow killed to look like an accident.
Where is the emperor and the army, soldier?
I'll nose around...
That's their job, isn't it?  To argue.  So, I think my case will be long on talk and short on action.
That makes his birth sign... Virgo! Why that's the sign of a little girl!  Can you tell my readers more about your star-crossed connection with Emperor Commodus?
You know, general, there is a Gate of Janus in Rome which is only closed in time of peace.  Sadly, it has remained open for three hundred years.
When the Senate and the Emperor agree miracles can happen.
Sneaking around with your brother?
I'm not fit for the job and as a matter of fact I'm not taking the job.
Isn't the helmet magnificent?
I've been overseeing production myself for the past three years, you'll be surprised at how wonderful our oil has become.
Let him trust Quintus.
How long do you think Commodus will let us live once he's in power?  A month?  Half a year?  Paestum will be a prison where he'll hold us until it's time...
Do you want to see Themis and Manto butchered?  If I die fighting Commodus he won't care about you. If I live I'll come and get you.
Your daughters need more than some vapors; they need you!
General, all I know is you have been condemned to the Colosseum, and a trial is nowhere to be seen.
You are to be killed, exactly. They'll give you a sporting chance, but just enough to make your murder... entertaining.  Romans like to mix their metaphors:  laughter with their executions, you know?  If you survive, though, you will become a gladiator.  A gladiator at least gets a fair fight.
Don't be ridiculous.
So I pretend I'm dead.  You get gold, what do I get?
Spend my days beheading country bumpkins?  I don't know, Proximo, who has better wine than you? Besides, I'm beginning to think of the Colosseum as my home.
Pressures on, eh Proximo?  There's got to be a load of money in this. Why else would you toss a red hot commodity like me out the window?
On you!  Of course!  You are my bravest fighter -- the best fighter I have ever seen!
A great deal.  They designed and build Tiger's chariot...
I can really rape them on this!  Can I at least tell them you'll think about it?
Yes.
No.
If it's all right with you, I'm not hungry.
But, Elaine --
Of course there is. Look -- The Veranda Room -- right there.
Of course not.
Yes.
You've got to go over the back fence and I'll meet you on the corner.
Yes. The married woman -- it wasn't just some woman --
Oh my God --
At the Zoo.
What do you think?
Elaine -- I love you.
Then what?
All right -- but listen to me. What happened was there was this party at my parents. I drove your mother home -- then we went upstairs to see your portrait --
But Elaine --
What?
Tomorrow?
Benjamin -- I haven't even said I'll marry you yet.
Why don't I just drag you off? All right -- I will. Right after we get the blood tests.
Shhhh.
No.
Excuse me.  Mr. McQuire.
Okay. Enough said. That's a deal.
Ahhh.
I am going to call the police now.
Get out!
Could you bring it up?
All right. Put it in the room where we were.
What?
Well it's in the car. It's out in the car.
Oh no.
What?
No. 
What for?
No.
What?
It's all right.
All right. Now finish your drink.
Yes.
Will you unzip my dress?
Yes, I have --
Yes.
I haven't. No.
Why don't I get it? Well -- I will then.  If you'll excuse me.
That's fine.
Benjamin.
Yes.
Benjamin.
This is all terribly wrong.
Is this -- what?
That's a laugh, Mrs. Robinson. That's really a laugh. Ha ha.
If you want.
Are you tired of it?
Well what do you want to talk about?
No. Think of another topic. Tell me what you did today.
What novel did you read.
What?
Can I undress and talk at the same time?
We don't.
No.
Now and then. He gets drunk a few times a year.
On New Year's Eve. Sometimes on his birthday.
I never did, Benjamin. Now let's --
Are you shocked?
Yes.
What?
That's enough.
Why not?
There's nothing to tell.
Benjamin, don't you ever take that girl out.
Yes.
Now don't start this.
Of course you did.
But if it's sickening for you --
May I stay then?
Then give me your word you won't.
Thank you.  Benjamin --
Benjamin -- I thought I made myself perfectly clear about this.
Mrs. Robinson -- I have a date with Elaine. We're going for a drive.
Where is Elaine?
Then what do you do? Do you meet someone?
Because I know you don't drive around for twelve hours.
Goodnight, Benjamin.
Next time he suggests it, I'll tell him I have no intention of ever calling her up in my life.
I'm going to marry Elaine Robinson.
No. Actually -- she doesn't know about us getting married yet.
That's a hell of a good age to be.
I wish I was that age again. Because, Ben --
Thank you.
No, it's not --
Ben, I think we're two civilized human beings. Do you think it's necessary to threaten each other?
Well, I don't think we have a whole lot to say to each other, Ben. I do think you should know the consequences of what you've done. I do think you should know that my wife and I are getting a divorce soon.
That's quite a statement.
Shaking hands. Well, that's not saying much for my wife, is it?
Well -- I'm sure you think you do, Ben, but after a few times in bed with Elaine I feel quite sure you'd get over that as quickly as you --
I think I've talked about this enough. I don't know how far I can go, Ben. I don't know if I can prosecute or not, but I think maybe I can. In the light of what's happened I think maybe I can get you behind bars if you ever look at my daughter again. I have seen Elaine and I have spent the afternoon taking steps to insure...
Yes, I can.
No! No -- we're just on our way downstairs!
Every glass high to life -- the splendid, dangerous, mighty, brief -- brief life -- and the courage to live it.  Baron, you know -- I've only lived since last night -- but that little while seems longer than all the time before -- all the -- 
What about the money?
You might find a bullet through that head...
Who?
That.
Oh -- work!!
No -- why? -- should I?
Aren't you?
Of course.
Yesterday -- yes -- that was yesterday.
Will you do me a big favor?
I fell in love last night -- the real thing.
Looking for my room -- one sixty- six.
And Baron, thanks so much for everything.
Why do you hide in my room?
Because you love me -- you love me?
I did not know you were so beautiful... and --
I'm not going -- You know I'm not going -- Let me stay here?
I? -- Oh, no. I do only what I take pleasure in doing.
I should like to smoke.
When I was a little boy I was taught to ride and be a gentleman -- at school, it was a monastery, I learned to pray and lie -- and ---
I'm a gambler -- I'm running at large like a happy pig, devouring anything of life that pleases me, I really belong in jail
I'm also a criminal and a hotel thief. 
I don't want them now.
I wanted money desperately -- Can you understand? -- That's why I wanted the pearls. I was threatened -- I was desperately in need of a certain big sum of money. I've been following you -- I've admired you. But I have forced myself not to think about you -- Last night, at last, I managed to came into your room and -- and now.
Yes -- yes -- yes.
For Vienna?
Oh no -- that would spoil everything. I'll -- I will manage somehow -- I'll manage myself. I will go with you. When does the train leave?
Never mind -- I'll get it. I have a whole day. I'll be on that train.
I'll go. -- I love you.  I'll be on that train. I'll get the money.
Don't.
Yes -- I will be on the train.
Yes, quite.
I would be awfully glad to oblige, you've been so decent to me. Three hundred?
Pardon me, Baron. Permit me again... 
I do drink, Baron -- I drink to you, Baron and to win.  It's good, -- come along, Baron.
All of that at once, Baron?
Oh -- yes -- that's it -- you found it -- you found it for me, Baron.
Certainly -- always when Grusinskaya dances.
I did not ask your advice.
I must have made a mistake.
Look here, sir -- I'm completely at your mercy -- I'm desperate -- it's a matter of life or death -- I had to get some money -- tonight.
No -- Madam Grusinskaya's car is not to be brought.
No -- letters to two-eighty.
What? -- Who? -- Whom?
Good heavens. What for?
Yes, thanks to the Baron. The best shops, the very best. Look, Doctor, silk -- feels so nice on the skin... a London hat, see -- made in England, that's silk, too -- fifty marks... Look, the price is on it. That was half my salary before. The Baron is a very fine gentleman -- no one in my life has been so nice to me as the Baron.
Stay where you are.
You are funny. You speak of life as if it were a train you wanted to catch.
Silk -- think of that -- silk -- they are, too.
Oh, don't go.
Yes -- that --
She's beautiful -- isn't she?
I'm happy, Miss Flaemm.
What?
Later?
Nonsense! We'll find a great doctor, he'll cure you. They can cure anything these days.
You're a good man, Mr. Kringelein -- a very good man.
Moreover --
Moreover...
Me.
Yes... A man I know took me to Switzerland last month...
My daughters -- yes, my daughters. 
I'll remember you, Mr. Kringelein.
Sit here.  Cognac -- for you?
Oh, yes.
You think so?
Why not?
Oh -- Preysing, Preysing --
You've decided against the merger?
Then, it's all over?
Why talk -- it's over -- it's over -- it's finished. You've broken off negotiations. You did it. You're calling them off. You had nothing on your mind all day, but Manchester, -- Manchester -- Manchester.  You don't suppose for one moment that I'm such a fool as not to have something that I could say definitely about Manchester. 
Thank God we're beginning at the beginning.
What a session this has been.
He likes to play the great man.
Madam Grusinskaya's car is to be brought.
Good morning, Madam.
Five minutes, Suzette, come back in five minutes. I'll ring.
Where is Pimenov? Where is Pimenov? 
Oh -- but it can't be.
Wait a minute. I've got to ask myself.
Every seat for the opening has been sold at Vienna. Sold out for three days.
Good morning, Gru -- your --
Well, now, that's very kind -- thanks. That's what I want -- a large room on the front with a private bath -- Yes, that's what I want. I can pay now if you like.
I don't know you.
Me?
He tried to rob me -- he is dead --
The scandal -- we are men -- you -- you could take that affair of the young lady upon yourself -- take her and hold your tongue. Then you can travel -- I'll give you anything -- anything -- she was with you.
I won't wait -- I can't wait -- I waited three days before I got a room at all and what a room that is.
Terrible. After this, no more ballets for me. Jazz --  Just jazz.
The troupe, the scenery, everything -- all on board, waiting. You have a rehearsal in Vienna tomorrow morning. Come, Madam, are you mad?
I'll see you in the morning then, at the conference. Everything'll be all right, Preysing... Don't worry. Goodnight.
That.
No one would have thought it of me. I've been getting rusty in Fredersdorf. Well, if bluff is what the world wants I guess I can put up as big a bluff as anyone. From now on... 
Yes -- that's what I want -- I'd like to tear loose -- I'd like a drink. I'd like to go down to that dancing place. I'd like to start something.
Did I buy you that dress, you piece of shit?
On the square, huh? And how are you making out these days? Stealing much?
Or else he's working an angle. If he doesn't steal a little, he's steeling big.
Roy? He's always crying.
Good evening. I'd like a single for tonight.
Fine.
And I don't just mean the SEC. We could have the FBI breathing down our necks.
One of those computer geniuses, isn't it?
Maybe I'll swing around Los Ang gleez on the way.
Why, of course it is. I can offer you -- well, five hundred dollars.
You are seeing it. You're looking right at it.
Hello.
Lead on.
Just myself.
I don't know offhand what your best year's been, we can look it up. The idea is, we'll top it by fifteen percent.
That's just the first year. If you aren't worth a lot more than that the second year, I'll kick you out. What do you say?
Perk.
Mr. Kaggs, I'm sorry.
They twisted my arm.
You do not! Roy Dillon? Cornball clown pictures? Commission salesman? It's all a front, isn't it? You're on the grift, I know you are. You're working some angle, and don't tell me you're not because I wrote the book!
That's me. That's who I am. You were never cut out for the rackets, Roy, and if you --
No can do. Have to dip in and out of my bag too much. Besides, it'll heal in the air.
Well, that's good news.
As though you do what I say.
You must have some money.
I thought it over, and you were right. You wanted me out of the rackets, and now --
I don't think so. You probably shouldn't either.
Yeah, sure, that sounds nice.
I don't?
A future. The only future I've got.
Is there nothing I can do, Roy, nothing at --
In your other hand.
Always, for you, baby.
Every day in every way.
Because it's comfortable.
Myra, I'm not following this.
The long end. Big con.
Yeah? How?
Upstate where?
Sure.
Open your door.
Open it and find out.
I called a fellow I know in Tulsa, the one who plays my chauffeur. There's a sucker there he says is made for us. And a boroker that just shut down, we can use their office, not change a thing! Now, I can scrape up ten grand without much trouble. That leaves fifteen or twenty for your end. We could start this weekend, get the sucker into position --
What?
Thank you.
It may be Lilly, but it isn't suicide.
My mother... Well, I guess it doesn't matter now. She worked for gamblers. She always knew they might turn on her some day.
You up to it now?
Well, uh, you know, she ate the gun.
Not many.
Pamela Whittington was a long time associate of Dr. Loomis.  Her home office was ransacked.  It was chock full of Loomis' files on Meyers.  It'd say that makes Meyers a suspect, wouldn't you?
That don't match either of the victim's.
Care to join me?
It's Blake.  How do you feel about Wisconsin?
Doesn't look good.
No shit.
You sure?
Nothing's missing?
Yes.
Call me Laurie, will ya?
I came to see you.
You saw that Michael Meyers display.  You've got to be pretty twisted to come up with something like that.
I'm okay.
Who?!
Looks great.  It does.
Nothing a good stiff drink can't fix.
Oh, please... you get that out of a fortune cookie?
What?
He's my brother.
I can't believe this is happening.
Yeah.
You think your mom knows we snuck out last night?
Reality check, dillweed.  This is 1995.
Guess so ...
The kids at school said this is a haunted house -- that a bad man used to live here.
I promise.
What the fuck are you doing letting strangers in without --
What makes you think he'll come here again?
Jamie?  But I thought she was --
It's ... Michael ... Michael Myers!
Danny, go downstairs -- Now!
I didn't -- He got in a fight and I --
Him.
'When applied directly to another person, Thorn could be used to call upon them confusion and destruction -- to literally visit them with the Devil.'
Mrs. Blankenship, have you seen the little boy who came in with me and --
He's gone.
Wait a minute ...
That's the whole idea of living in the country.  I thrive on the seclusion.
Or what's left of him.
It's a sign.  He's come home.
Any word on the location of the Strodes?
Why did you take Jamie?
Stay away, Sam.
I know he's alive.  People in this town -- they want us to believe he's dead.  But I know. I've always known.
No one.
I'm gonna wet my pants.
You know what gets me?
At least!
After eight years in the jungle with you, I know Mrs. Wheeler better than I know anybody in the universe!
This room is full of ghosts.
Go home!
That's the point!  Walk in there and find whatever there is to find--before Alice can cover it up.
Leave me alone!  After eight years of horrendously close association, the time has come to part!  I crave solitude and time for reflection-- and then a reunion in privacy with my own flesh and blood.  You and I may not meet again for months!
You're right!  We'll take a trip. A trip is what we'll take.  I don't want to talk about motorcycles.  I don't want to talk about tits.  Go home!
The educational process.
You know me, boy.
Oh.  I'd forgotten.
Shut up, you ninny!  You were never to come here again-- for any reason whatsoever!
Tit for tat--as simple as that.
The one direct, decisive, intelligent act of your life!
It sapped our will--made us peaceful and unenterprising.  It was a form of chemical castration. We became two more sleepy Indians.
What you say is, "Pass the fucking catsup."
I've considered that.
Out!
As a matter of fact--
Do you mind if I ask who you are?
Is anybody besides you here now?
I'll see.
She met him at college.
What's good about that?
Tell me some true stories about Dad.
"The sting."
Tell me that.
Mhravitch.
Dr. Woodly says he's seen hundreds of children permanently injured by football.  He says that when there's a war, everybody goes but football players.
Go ahead.  No, no, no, no.
Is Looseleaf Harper alive?
She's a real heavy sleeper sometimes.
Can't it keep till morning?
The smallest thing I've got.
What's this?
Welcome to manhood, you little sparrowfart!  Load that gun!
It's your house, Dad.
You are woman.  I know woman well.
He thought he could take my place. It is now my privilege to give an unambiguous account of why I don't think he's man enough to do that.
I have a brain.
You're wrong.
People don't use that word any more.
I will not be scrogged.  I remember one time I saw you wrench a hook from the throat of a fish with a pair of pliers, and you promised me that the fish couldn't feel.
I'd like to have the expert opinion of the fish--along with yours.
The whole concept of heroism--and its sexual roots.
Yes.
I don't think so.
What are you going to do?
Your clothes are at the city dump by now.  Perhaps you can get a map from the Department of Sanitation.
It isn't a matter of liking.  It's a matter of getting used to death-- as a perfectly natural thing. Would you mind leaving?  No woman ever walks out on Harold Ryan, and then comes back--for anything.
Almost a Christmas scene.
I want you to tell me that you loved me once.
I see.
Rifle?
What a handsome word.
You've killed women?
Of course he can go--if he'll just go down on his hands and knees for a moment--and promise me that he does not find me comical in the least degree.
Ooops.
Hello, Mother.
Oh, oh, oh--I thought it was your apartment.  You seemed at home here.
She still has just the one child-- the boy?
And her fianc?!
A policeman delivered the baby in a taxicab.
I know malaria.  Malaria isn't caused by the bites of bats.
I can just hear the editorial wee- wee-weeing when Looseleaf and I start flying in pacqualinincheewa root.  I can hear the Alice-sit-by- the-fires now: "We discovered it in the Amazon Rain Forest.  Now we cure you with it.  Now we lower our eyes with becoming modesty as we receive heartfelt thanks."
We'll find out now, won't we?
Now who's being cruel?
King Arthur.
In any event, I will not beg for mercy.
Don't you laugh even inwardly at the heroic balderdash you spew?
You aren't going to hurt me.  You aren't going to hurt anybody any more.  Any violent gesture will seem ridiculous--to yourself!
My violin is avenged!
And the hell with it.  It was so tragically irrelevant, so preposterously misinformed.
Oh God--you're really going to kill me. HAROLD It won't hurt as much as the sting of a bumblebee.  Heaven is very much like Paradise, they say. You'll like it there.
I've enjoyed being man.
Have it your way.  We'd both be better off dead now.
Somewhere in this city.  Not here, not here.  Tell Penelope I loved her--in my clownish way.  And Paul. Tell him to be a healer, by all means.
Use the sanitary facilities, if I may.
I'll put it in Paul's room, where it belongs.
Colonel Harper, retired now, dropped an atom bomb on Nagasaki during the Second World War, killing seventy-four thousand people in a flash.
Thank you.  You can leave now.  We'll begin.
Well--I walked up to the front door. I was still alive.  Big surprise. I rang the doorbell, and old Mrs. Wheeler answered.  She had her Goddamn knitting.  I said, "Guess who?" She conked right out.
I heard you were looking for me.
Yes.
It's my father's birthday--that's all.  That's all.  Who cares about that?
Men can touch other men, and it doesn't mean a thing.  Haven't you ever seen football players after they've won the Superbowl?
Wouldn't you rather have your mother marry me than him?
You're the only woman he ever took out.
I was afraid to ask.
I didn't know that.
Who have you been talking to?
No.
Father's friend.
That man is your father.
Then get him.
How's the fungus around your thumbnail?
Something happens to my confidence.
Yeah.
He ditched me.  He started running, and I started running, then he lost me in the park.
He said one other thing.  It wasn't very nice.
What's so wonderful if I lost the sale?  You poor kid.
I'm glad somebody finally cried. Every time I come in here and see all this unnecessary death, I want to cry.  I don't cry, of course.  Not manly, you know.  Did she try antihistamines?
Tonight's the night.
Why would you do that?
Paul's only twelve years old.
We've got to rescue him.
It's a jungle out there.
We met here earlier this evening.
You fake!  You're no better than the dumbest general in the Pentagon.  You're not going to beat Harold. You're not going to beat anybody. You're not going to stay here, either--yammering and taunting until you're most gloriously killed. Go home!
That maid just quit.  The place is a mess.  You can start in the master bedroom.
Not true.
None of my relatives are Chinese Communists.  Speak for yourself.
You can believe that if you want. I talk to guys like you, and I want to commit suicide.  You get that weight-lifting set I sent you?
You're preparing him for a career in the slaughterhouses of Dubuque?  Take care of your body, yes!  But don't become a bender of horseshoes and railroad spikes.  Don't become obsessed by your musculature.  Any one of these poor, dead animals here was a thousand times the athlete you can ever hope to be. Their magic was in their muscles. Your magic is in your brains!
It's good.  Let him go.
We can take off the "Wanda June" with a butter knife.
Yes, we do.
Mozart plays shuffleboard.
No.
Big threat. TV would ream you.
We offer Female Wrestling, that is, nude body to body contact, with a girl of your choice in a private room. Twenty dollars a half hour, thirty dollars hour. Any other arrangements may be discussed in the privacy of your room. Tipping is permitted. We accept Bank Americard, Master Charge and American Express.
I said I just wanted to talk to you...
Wait?
Okay.
I was told there was a real nice girl here named Joanne. Quite young.
Three hundred?
Half now, half later.
Okay. My client pays for it anyway.
I am.
I don't drink, but you can go out.
No.
Did you ever live in a room with six people and you didn't have any money, any food, any furniture? Have your brother come out, his car break down, he can't get a job? Your friends stealing food, going through trash behind a supermarket?
No.
But it's all you do.
Tijuana.
He deals in pain.
It's an anagram. It comes from the Canons of Dort. Every letter stands for a different belief. T-U-L-I-P. Like -- are you sure you're interested in this?
No, please go on.
I thought I was fucked up.
Do you live in a house back in wherever.
On your own land?
...What do you have to offer?
If I was you, Mr. Mast, I'd watch my language.
Yeah.
I'm back in Grand Rapids.
What have you found out?
No.
That's like a stag film.
No.
They are?
What's it called?
But the police...
How did you find me?
What will I tell the others? They care about you.
Okay.
What?
No.
Oh.  Why is it that you want to get into film financing?
Calm down, mister. You don't want to get the cops in here do you? You got a family?
Why don't you just go outdoors, mister? Cool off.
Well, each time he comes in closer, like this.
Who? Van Dorn? You must be kidding yourself, honey. You think once that guy finds his daughter he'll care about you?
You working in San Diego now?
Yes, I am.
Yes. Those little pieces of paper with your picture on it?
None of that, lady.
Is this your shovel?
Lady! Be quiet.
Edith, I'd like you to meet my son, Harold. Harold, this is Edith... eh?
I'm a file clerk - Harrison Feed and Grain.
I'm a file clerk.
What?... Oh yes... Shovel... Create ... Verily these issues lie in the lap of the gods... Iliad... Just sit down for a minute.
Me neither. I heard he was eighty years old. I'll be eighty next week. A good time to move on, don't you think?
Thank you. But when you take these cars don't you think you are wronging the owners?
Still, I think you'd upset people and I'm not sure that's right.
Thank you, but I really have to go.
Maude???!
That's really great.
Oh. Eh, I like it.
That's the influence of the right food, the right exercise, and the right breathing.  Greet the dawn with the Breath of Fire!  Of course, there's no doubt the body is giving out. I'm well into autumn. I'll have to be giving it all up after Saturday. Sweeten the tea with honey, Harold. It's delicious.
Is he all right?
What is that he's working on?
My umbrella?  Oh, that's just a relic. I found it when I was packing to come to America. It used to be my defense on picket lines and rallies and political meetings - being dragged off by police or attacked by thugs of the opposition.  A long time ago.
I don't know.
Yes. It's almost there.
Well --  - they say he was very wise, so I'm sure he must have.
Me!  When I look around me I know I know nothing. I remember though, once long ago in Persia, we met a wise man in the bazaar. He was a professional and used to sell his wisdom to anyone willing to pay. His specialty for tourists was a maxim engraved on the head of a pin. "The wisest," he said, "the truest, the most instructive words for all men at all times." Frederick bought one for me and back at the hotel I peered through a magnifying glass to read the words - "And this too shall pass away."  Well, the wise man was right - if you remember that, you can't help but live life fully.
I like you, Maude.
Where's that?
Boy! It sure has been a wonderful day. And you - you are beautiful.
I've never met her. My mother set it up.
Well, don't go.
Really. Just put it there, Harold.
Maude, do you think you can help me?
... of you. You'll all end up like this.
No. It had nothing on this afternoon.
Yes. They're old friends.
We <u>are</u> alone - you and me and everybody. But we can look at those stars and maybe someone down the beach or across the sea in China is looking at them, too. Someone we don't know and most likely will never see - that someone is breathing along with us. And the star- gazers of the past - from peasant to princes - and the star-gazers of the future - all of us breathing and looking up there. We are alone - but look at the stars and never feel lonely.
Maude.
Oh, I am happy, Harold. Ecstatically happy. I couldn't imagine a lovelier farewell.
It's true. I can't live without you.
I have a sore throat.
To whom?
What?
No. I'm learning the banjo. Do you?
An accurate number would be difficult to gauge.
Well, some worked out better than others - some had to be abandoned in the planning stages - do you include the first time? - then there's the question of maiming...
Does that worry you?
Why?
Oh. Well, how do you spend your day?
Yes. What kind of things do you do?
Yes.
Yes.
During wartime the national suicide rate goes down.
To pit your own life against another.
Oh, sure. A variety of weapons.
Oh sure.
Yes, ma'am. Somebody had some trouble parking.
Oh, don't be too discouraged. For aesthetic appreciation - always a little time.
We've always been here.
I knew you'd come.
Yes!
Don't waste your tears. Look at him!
I'm a girl who keeps her promises.
What's the matter with her?
God, that's terrible.
Kirsty, I'm sorry... don't understand. I...
If anyone can help, HE can.
The Boxes. In the House. I told you.
The boxes! I TOLD you.
No. Don't let it. You've come this far.
No more deals, Kirsty. It's your flesh we want to experience, not your skill at bargaining.
No, No, this one didn't escape. You told me you'd always been in Hell. You were wrong. Look at it. LOOK. IT'S YOU.
You're in the Malahide Institute. It's a psychiatric hospital. But, hey, don't feel judged -- it was just the nearest place to bring you. Remember? You and your boyfriend...?
Don't worry. He's O.K. We sent him home hours ago. Jeez, what a story.
Is he serious??
You mean, outside... with her.
Rotten eggs and the safety of mankind.
Skip to the end, willya?  How do I kill it -- ?
No. It was red. Bright red.
Tom -- he's our guest, not a prisoner.
I know where to find him. I'll get him back.
Who wards off demons.
How hard can it be? I punched the crap out of that thing that he sent -- ouch!!
Me?? C'mon --
Abe possesses a unique frontal lobe.  "Unique." That's a word you'll hear quite a bit around here.
"In the absence of light, darkness prevails." For there are things that go bump in the night, Agent Myers.  We are the ones who bump back.
Oh, please. I'm not "pure of heart."
Agent Myers is your new liaison.
Nah. I'll be around, Red, just back in the field.
His horns. He files 'em. To "fit in."
That's what you do. That's why we need you. You have an insight.  You know monsters.
No. Don't --
Oh-n-no -- I --
No one ever helps me. It's my job.
Well, let's see -- there was that moment, when I had a train on top of my head --
"Need" is a good, solid word.
Just a scratch.  I wanted to see you.
Goodnight.
Coffee's warming me up.
We're leaving.
Julia's my second wife.
HE did. I've seen him.
It's important.
First things first. You can have a telephone when we've talked. Do you know who did this to you?
I don't remember.
What? What will you do? What CAN you do?  There's nothing to be frightened of.
This isn't happening.
Hush now. It's all right Frank's here.
That's right. Who are you?
Oh.  Oh yes.
Who?
Keep your voice down.
You promised me an explanation.
What kind of doors?
And the blood let you out?
I said no.
I don't think so. She'll want Larry first.
I need a skin. Then we leave --
Hi. I got soaked.
Just an accident. He's all right. Will you drive? He needs stitches.
We'll sell it. Sell everything.
You mean we're moving in?
I'm going to throw up.
So damn stupid.
O.K.
Kirsty.
He was insane, baby: a mad dog. I put him out of his misery --
What?
Not much.
Please.
I prefer the floor.
Try me.
Steve.
I found a room.
No Dad.
Surprise.
Never better. You sleep well.
I love you, honey.
Maybe you should give it some time.
She's not like Mom. She's... I don't know... moody. I thought that was what you liked about her.
Sure.
Of course.
I want to see.
Yes!
What's the problem?
I have to get out.
Oh no.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have surprised you.
Just trying to get my apartment in order.
Just go. PLEASE. I'll be O.K. I'm going to go see Dad. He'll look after me --
I hate to quibble with you Rob, but she married her first boyfriend. Kevin Bannister.
Since when did this shop become a fascist regime?
Great.  That's the fun of working in a record store.  Playing crappy pap you don't want to listen to.  I thought this tape was going to be, you know, a conversation stimulator. I was going to ask you for your top five records to play on a Monday morning and all that, and you just had to ruin it.
Well what's the point in that?
He offended me with his terrible taste.
No, but would you think, from that one sentence.  That I was going to see it?
Let's pack it up.  We haven't had a customer in four hours.
Yeah, you would say that, wouldn't you?  You two have to stick together now.  Boners United.  United in getting some.
What band?
You are not in a band, Barry.  You are not a musician.  And no posters.
Barrytown.  Barrytown?  Is there no end to your arrogance?
So much for friends, then.  You're a bitter bastard, Rob, you know that?
Whatever.  Okay. "Tell Laura I Love Her." That'd bring the house down. Laura's mom could sing it.
No way.
We're not as bad as you think, Rob.
What do you think?  Dick likes it.
I owe it to myself to go right to the edge, Rob, and this group does exactly that.  Over the edge, in fact.
That's what we want.  Reaction.  And if Laura's bourgeois lawyer friends can't take it, then fuck 'em.  Let 'em riot, we can handle it.  We'll be ready.
Because it's sentimental tacky crap, that's why not.  Do we look like the kind of store that sells "I Just Called To Say I Loved You?" Go to the mall and stop wasting our time.
I have all of the others.
Nothing.
Anna who?  Anna Green Gables?  Anna Conda?
Well, I used to go to the Dodger on your nights, and I saw you're doing it again and that your putting out a record, and it's sort of a then-and- now story against the backdrop of the Chicago music scene with the emphasis on now.
I thought I would ask you a few questions if that's okay.
Pardon me?
OF COURSE... Well yeah, a bit. "Sin City" by the Flying Burrito Brothers is an all-time top five, but I wouldn't play it at the club.  It's a country-rock ballad.  Everybody'd go home.
Can I go home and work this out and let you know?  In a week or so?
"Music for Old People." What does that mean?
Yeah.  A billion.  Right... How are you?
Can I help you?
Yeah.  I'm sorry... Look Dick, Laura and I broke up.  She's gone.  And if we ever see Barry again maybe you can tell him that.
I want a tape.
-- FUCK OFF!
Yeah but more than that.  I'm happy because I'm proud of us.  Because although our talents are small and peculiar, we use them to their best advantage.
You're a horrible person, Barry.  I mean it.
Maybe I should talk to him.
Conflict resolution is my job, Laura.
Come on, Rob.  My relationship with Laura has obviously disturbed you a great deal.
We are not talking jokey understatement here, Rob.  We're talking actionable harassment.  Ten phone calls a night, hanging around outside my house...
Good.  So shall we leave it at that then?
We've done the hard part now.  I might as well, you know...
I should be so lucky.
-- whatever, and the Israelis and the Palestinians don't.  Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye are not engaged in a bitter territorial dispute, and the Israelis and the Palestinians are. Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye --
-- and who says I like Marvin Gaye, anyway?
Just the obvious stuff.
I don't know.
No.
So, what, you haven't definitely decide to dump me?  There's still a chance we'll get back together?
Hey, I just want to know where I stand.  What chance --
Jesus Christ, Rob.  Is that really what's bothering you?
I'm sorry to call, but I need that stuff...
No, not -- I mean have you, you know --
I guess.
Jesus.  I do not know.  I'll talk to you later.
Is that the last of it?
You still together?  Going all right?
Mmm hmm.
I'm sorry to go on about it.  But, I don't know, there's a lesson here somewhere, and I want to make sure you get it.
Hey, how ya doin'?
Pig died.
No, no.  When are you going home?
I didn't mess things up because I was scared.  I slept with Ray because I was sick of you.  And I needed something to snap me out of it.
It'll have to be sex, then.
I'm too tired not to go out with you.
Ray's a disaster.  I don't know what that was all about, except that sometimes you need someone to lob into the middle of a bad relationship like a hand grenade, I guess, and blow it all apart.
It was like sex.  What else could it be like?
Fantastic.  The Girlfriend Lottery.
I'm alright.
No use.
At Paul and Miranda's.  Paul from work.
Fair enough.
You called this morning?
Yeah.  Like I said, I don't want to take sides.  And I like Laura with you.  She's more fun, more open. You guys are good together.  I just wish you two could, I don't know.  I don't think much of this Ian guy --
No, no, I love, it's just, thinking you're, you must be so sick of it... Well.
Yup.
Yeah, but if you heard this band called the Crumblers, you'd --
Yeah, I know the Crumblers!  I bought a used Blasters album in New York about ten years ago and somebody left a Crumblers single in it.  My everything changed for a couple of weeks.
I use it but I don't understand it when other people use it.
How's the store?
Well call her mother.
Then what are you getting so upset about?
It's got nothing to do with marriage, if that's what you're getting at.
Years.  This collection is as close as he's ever come to an achievement.
Suit yourself.  There are plenty of others who will.
Sixty.
Records are those big round black things, right?
Mr. Congeniality?  Let him find his own clues.  There's a journal article in this somewhere.
Fine.
There was a Count.  Count Dusan.  He would invite the local peasants to his chateau, fill them full of wine, then slice their bellies so he could reuse it.  The symmetry of that somehow always appealed to me.
Then you didn't know Richard later on.
The boy _died_?
So's playing choo-choo with two high school cheerleaders in the middle of-
-All but one out of a hundred, I know.  All left to be led like donkeys back home.  Now if you will please-
Where?
He's dead.  Whatever I may or may not feel means exceedingly little to him now.
Go home.
No one knows you're here?
It will take some time for the forms to clear before you go to Gettysburg.
Yes.
A factor of age.
You won't.
You are a very perceptive young woman.
What could possibly be worth all this murder and distruction.
Of bodies.
Is that a threat?
Empty.  And fear.  Fear of those that would kill you and fear of those that would love you.  It can never last, and in the end you always end up destroying both.
It's all the same.  Half lives that never go away.
All of it finished.
Will I see you again?
You better have a warrant.  That's my notebook, you've got no right to be sticking your fingers into it.
You and I should talk first.
What are you getting at, Moran?
It'll never stick.
You're an asshole, Moran.
Never take up poker, Detective.
All I need is for you to check the name.
I'll take care of that Corey, but I need this now.
Some job.  Card filing and cabinet dusting.  Four years in this dump and I haven't written anything for Wilson that a wounded yak couldn't do.
Why?
I've seen nobleman swords that weren't as well preserved.  It's just a hunk of peasant iron.  Why would he be carrying it around in an alley?
I was nearly killed.
Some cling to sanity through time with the one continuity and trad0 ition their lives have known: The Game.  You and I Conor, we are different from all others around us.  You know this, you can feel it.  We are flesh and bone like any man, but unlike our neighbors we are rather difficult to injure,  permanently.
What?
This can't be.
Go to hell.
It's like to kill me first.
And you?
So why the crazy talk?  It's a miracle it is.  Saint Andrew has smiled on me.  On us.
What would you like?
Certainly not me.
They're nothing but boys.  It will be a slaughter tomorrow.
Mulet.
Staff sargeant detailed me to prepare firewood for the break- fast cooking.
Second musketeer.
Excuse me, "sir".  I thought we spoke as equals.
It can be different.  It must be.
Stay out of it.
But Ian, he's still but a boy.
Thanks.
You'd think he'd had practice.
How many came?
And the Bulgarian?
How many places this side of the Atlantic serve lager and lime?
I've had a few more concerns.
And if I refuse?
Should I care?
Yes.
I was walking by when I heard a shout.  Your men came right after.
That's none of your business.
Your murder weapon?
A mystery.
A neighbor saw your car leave.
His only kid.
No.
No, just a farewell appearance, batting for Sweeney. I'm going into business for myself.
The poem?... The poem was great!
You're so nice, Bruce, you think everybody else is.
He comes by it naturally. His grandfather was a snake.
That's what he did to me. Swept me right off my feet -- and left me lying on the floor.
Fine. And here's a kiss for you.
Oh, yes. Here it is.

Well, er -- it looked a little cloudy this morning.
I know you will, Bruce. Are you going to live with your mother?
Certified! I'm afraid Hildy'd feel ashamed to think she hadn't trusted you.
Oh, sure.  Well, thanks for everything.
If she's not there, mother and I are leaving anyhow!
Suppose she is -- I have feelings, too! Do you know where I've been for the last couple of hours? Locked up in a police station and she didn't move to do anything about it.
And now I don't know where my mother is. She may be lost.
She's -- well, she's very motherly. That's about the best description I know.
I'll give you three minutes to tell me where he is.
Who's under arrest? You pimple-headed, square-toed spy -- do you realize what you're doing?
We'll take a chance on that, Burns.  Go ahead, boys. 
Your luck's not with you now!
Maybe it was yesterday. Been seeing me in your dreams?
You know, Hildy, I sort of wish you hadn't done it.
All I know is that instead of two weeks in Atlantic City with my bridegroom, I spent two weeks in a coal mine with John Kruptzky -- age sixty-three -- getting food and air out of a tube! You don't deny that. Do you?
Walter, you're wonderful in a loathesome sort of way. Now, would you mind keeping quiet long enough for me to tell you what I came up here for?
Well, the paper'll have to learn to do without me. And so will you. It just didn't work out, Walter.
You -- you --
What's the matter?
Keep away --
Say, could I meet him?
How do you like that? Here I am being nice to you and your sweet-heart and that's the thanks I get!
Well, it's either an act on your part or a miracle on Sweeney's.
Yes --- and that's putting it mildly! No certified check -- no story -- Get me?
It cost me four hundred and fifty bucks to tear it out of Cooley.
Never mind it? That's not my money! That's Bruce's money!
Well, this expert Dr. Egelhoffer, from New York, decides to make Williams re-enact the crime --
Let go o' me! I've got to get Bruce out of jail! Oh, Walter, why did you have to do this to me?
Wait a minute -- wasn't it Stanley who discovered Livingstone?
I'd like to think.
I get it!
Call him a love-child, if you want to.  Duffy!
You been in a fight?
Louie!
Shut up, will you?  You sure? Nobody?
Murder, uh?
I mean -- working together. Just like the old days. The things we've been through, Hildy.
That's all right, Walter. It's as much my fault as yours.
Don't touch me! I'm not doing it for you!
Because I'm a newspaper woman, Heaven help me!
Yeah. Only -- only I'm not leaving, Walter.
What would you do if it was a daughter?
What's the matter with my brains?
Well, I'd like to be lady-like and think it over.
Hildy, from this time on no tricks, no double-crossing -- everything on the level!
Yes -- 'Hildy, darling'. I'm just a fool. That's what I am. I know what it's going to be like.
Anybody with hair on his chest. Get 'em off the street -- anywhere. Offer them anything -- only get them.  We've got to get this desk out of here.
I think it is.
I can't Hildy. It means my job! It means --
Me, too.
Come, come, Sheriff, lightning doesn't strike in the same place twice. Nothing's going to happen.
Yes, sir.
Good. Now I want to ask you fellows a couple of questions. Did Earl Williams know what he was doing when he fired that gun?
Aw, why don't you let her alone? She's ill!
What's the use? I can't win a pot.
What's the dope, Sheriff?
Probably goin' out to get Williams.
Hold her, boys!
What do I know about Williams?
All right! Carl! Frank! One of you get on each side of the desk. Take hold of the cover.
This tear bomb went off unexpectedly in the hands of Sheriff Hartman's Bombing Squad.
The names are Merwyn D. Mayor, who is the Mayor's brother-in-law --
Howard Shenken, the Sheriff's uncle on his mother's side --
What do you mean -- through?
Fred, I don't know what to say. A thing like this almost destroys a man's faith in human nature.
I did.  Hold the wire.
Now what do you say?
Just -- one -- second!
It's a frame-up! Some imposter!
That's good, Earl. Oh, they've got another alienist to see you. He ought to be here any minute. Don't go to sleep, will you?
Now, Hildy, don't be hasty! I can't let him out.
Five hundred dollars.
-- You were with her. You were in the cab, weren't you?
I thought so, too.
No -- what?
What -- already? Why, the dame left only a minute before I did!
Well -- I was going, but Mollie fainted away and I thought I ought to do what I could.
I'm quoting my son, and he has never lied to me.
Is that how you came to shoot the policeman?
Put down that gun, Earl.
Don't move!
Sure you could, Earl -- but you wouldn't want to do that, would you? You wouldn't want to kill anybody.
We'll get you out in ten minutes.
Get the Governor on the phone!
Huh?
You're insane!
A very fine-looking women.
We want to see you.
His Honor, the Mayor, now comes out with a statement that Earl Williams is a dangerous character in the employ of two or three foreign governments and the police are going to get him dead or alive. Somebody sends out a tip that this guy is hiding in Molly Malloy's joint. And this colored policeman, Daniels, goes over to pick Williams up. Williams has read the papers, thinks the cop is going to kill him and shoots first. That is all.
Baldwin. The blushing bridegroom -- himself.
Wants Hildy -- and sounds very excited.
Put your hand on mine, get the knack of it.
Very well, Grandpa.
Yes, you was. Make him talk.
What's that?
Bugger off.
Bloody.
Won't they have maps?
It doesn't matter, I can drive the car home.
Not now. They wouldn't believe me.
It's dinner time. It really is. Cross my heart.
The sodding water table.
It's like telling fibs.
They might be.
Thanks. I hope you can come for the launching.
...two Indians to fan me all night. The heat.
Kiss me Hardy.
I heard the drum and fife yesterday, Mac, marching past.  Made my hair stand on end.  I thought, I've been asleep for twenty years.
Never done better. On the fiddle. Like everyone else.
There is all right. This Hitter fellow. We've got to winkle him out. And get shot of some of our lot at the same time.
And I'm still just a lad myself.
What's that?
Jam.
Don't be silly, Dawn.
It's just the wrench, Grace. It's for their sake.
Happy days.  When you're bigger, Bill, I'll teach you the googly.
A Polish pilot. It's like one of those jokes on the wireless.
You might still have a house.
You know something, Molly? I like it on my own. I never got used to sharing a bed, not really.
Happy as can be. In the old groove.
Deadwood, is that what it's called? Cool, will you show us?
What?
I always hate saying the word cheese, every time you get your picture taken... smile, say cheese.
Cool.
What about R.J.?
No, I told you...
If you keep going straight you can get back on the interstate... it's easier.
OK.
Ain't the only thing tasty in this house. 
Whoopie fucking doo.
The animals have got nothing to do with it.
Fucking great.
Now, what makes you think that?
I'll bet you do... how much we owe ya...  ...Goober?
How long is a piece of string? Too God damn long, that's how long.
I don't drive cross country.
Oh yeah, I forgot about her. She was pretty hot.
Dude, talk about baggage, that ain't no carry-on shit, that's some heavy duty Samsonite shit.
So, the guy goes to Hell and the devil says, "do you smoke?" The guy say, "yeah"... the devil say, "great cause Tuesday is cigar night, sweetest Cuban cigars you ever had."
Then the devil asks, "do you drink?" Guy says, "yeah"... devil say, "wonderful, Wednesday is free drinks night, best booze you ever had... all made from the finest stuff."
Don't panic yourself, way too much caffeine guy... I see a sign.  Captain Spaulding's Museum of Madmen and Monsters... cool. Also... fried chicken and... gasoline... next exit.
How much further?
I don't know.
What's that?
Turn that fucking radio off!
I mean obviously we will compensate you for your troubles.
Man, it's already ten thirty.
It's a girl.
What I need are some answers. 
Yeah, they weren't here but a few minutes, didn't really have time to get as up close and personal as I do with most of the assholes that wander through here.
Hmmmmm.
No, none. I had one once, back in '57 maybe... I don't know. Really ain't nobody we wanna be jaw flapping at around here no more.
How's he get around out here?
Grab Mary and come inside.
Fried chicken.  Anybody want some?
Hey, listen to this... I think this is related to our Dr. Satan.
Now she was put in the nuthouse in 1930 at the age of 16.
I don't...  ...I just thought it was weird.
Thanks for coming to get us. Little brother almost scared us to death.
Yes, thank you. Thank you very much.
I don't know, I think he's funny.
Shhhhhh.
I know, but we can make it out of here. We can do it.
Christ, I hope this isn't more crappy folk art. It's so quaint... it's so primal... it's so crap.
Aw, shit...  I gotta pee anyway.
Yeah, hey how far do you think we are from your Dad's?
You got to be fucking joking.
I can't believe...
Yeah, she said we looked queer.
I don't know... about half an hour.
What? I didn't hear anything.
Not yet.
Just in the wrong place at the wrong time.
Yep, I suppose it is.
Keys.
Huh?
I don't doubt that.
Huh?
Enough with the stupid voices.
Doing what? Messy up your day? Well, fuck lady there are some bigger issues at hand... than your fucking have a nice fucking day bumper sticker shit!
This can't be real, this can't be real, this can't be real.
Excuse me, I'm sorry for disturbing you this fine afternoon.
Oh, you are very welcome... Lord knows how I love a man in uniform.
Well, go get her.
Fit the profile?
Right.
Right.
Yeah...  ...huh, what the hell are you talking about?
Right...  ...come on.
We found one.
Son, your mother and I are doing a production of The Gin Game at the local community theater. We forgot to take off our make-up.
Gabrielle.
I am a foolish little thing. I am pink in my face, no? It is only that I have been so lonely lately and... I am ashamed. I'll see you tomorrow, okay? Unless... Am I fired now?
Not at all.
I'm in my p.j.'s, too. Funny, huh?
When you were a little French girl?
I'm fine. Life is funny, that's all.
I shouldn't say this, but you're pretty, Gabrielle. It's unprofessional, I know.
Nothing, my darling. All is right with the world.
Hmmph. Hmmph.  Nathan, we have to talk, you and I.
I just want to talk.
You think too much. I need a man who doesn't think so much but acts more than he thinks... is what I need!
No!
That's Lila?
I don't know.
It's an animal urge, Puff. It's nothing to be ashamed of.
Very well.
I want to be the way I was before.
We bury the body. We disappear into the woods. Nobody knows.
Won't he be able to tell?
Three foot one.
Please, honey, let me in.
With pleasure.
They're so even keel. They forge ahead with slow determination. They don't get distracted or side-tracked. They don't care what they look like. They don't care that people look at them and go, "Ewww. A slug."
You've got to respect that.
Where?
We are animals after all.
Tell her, Harold...  It's just that... It's nothing. It's just that the outside fork is the salad fork. One goes from the outside in as the dinner progresses.
I'm sorry that I became so upset.
I like you, too, Nathan.
Nathan!
Why certainly!
I don't think so.  Why?
He looks perfectly fine.
Nathan, what the hell are you talking about?
Nothing. Be right out.
Absolutely, Gabrielle.  Someone from work!  Sorry about that, Gabrielle. Uh-huh. Exactly.
I have to think! I have to think!
Sure. Of course.
Nothing. Hard day. Gonna have a drink.
Such as what womanly things?
Absolutely!
Should I come with?
Lila...
Ooka.
Now, Puff, we're leaving on the electronic collar. I don't think we'll need to shock you, but just in case.
Yahoo!
Even better.
It would be my pleasure, doctor.  Distinguished gentlemen and ladies of the psychological community, I stand before you today, a living testament to the amazing skill of Dr. Nathan Bronfman. To say that he took me from crayons to perfume would be a vast understatement. Dr. Bronfman took me from playing with my own feces, then to crayons, and then to an appreciation of the complex works of Franz Kline, Joseph Beuys, and Marcel Duchamp. From compulsive masturbation to...
Down from the tree. Both of you. Keep your hands where I can see them. Don't want you pulling any weapons out of your fur.
Do you suppose it has anything to do with Lila's unusually hairy body?
I just think it might be important to explore your feelings for Lila.
Check!
Right.
Soon as I finish my coffee.
That's right, Miss Packard.
We're neighbors now. You can call me Sarah.
Thank you.
It's what Eddie wants. He, uh, told me to give you some money.
That's the way it's done.
The night is two thousand dollars old.
What did he say?
Sit down.
Two.
Yeah? Why?
I lost twenty bucks.
So I stay. Stay until I hustle up enough to play Fats again. Maybe by that time I'll develop myself some character.
What's that supposed to mean?
To do what?
You think I can lose?
Yeah, you already told me that. You cut that slice down to bite-size and maybe we can talk.
You know everybody, don't you?
Like I told ya. My thumbs.
I don't. But I got confidence in Findley.
Good. I'd hate to think I was putting my money on a cripple.
I don't believe you, Eddie. I think you're still a loser.
No, it don't have to be fifty. It can be thirty... twenty-five.
Look, friend, I'm not trying to hustle. I don't never hustle people that walk into poolrooms with leather satchels. Don't try to hustle me.
What kind of straight pool game you like?
Okay, I told you what I wanted about Minnesota Fats. You just go ahead and play him, friend.
Luck! Whaddya mean, luck?
You're drunk, boy. I'm not gonna bet ya any more.
I'll be alive when I get out, Charlie.
Okay... Okay. Nobody can beat you.
A son.
Aw, Eddie.
You wanna come back on the road with me, okay, the money's yours. But if you wanna give it to Minnesota Fats... nothing doing. What do you say?
Is that what you think?
Well, hello. Haven't seen you in a long time.
Would you like to come out tonight?
Yeah. Sure.
Oh man, you're way out of our league.
Half and a dollar.
Couple of bucks.
You know what, kid? I think maybe you're a hustler.
Yeah, I'm quittin'.
What?
Since four.
Fine, thanks.
Thanks. I will.
Why not? We already know each other's secrets.
I drink.
No. No more. I'm getting sleepy.  Thank you very much, Mr...?
Give me a drag.
What did you say that for, Sarah?
At school. It's Thursday.
You want to go with me?
You'll find yourself another rich old lover.
A loser?
Is that what makes a winner?
I love you.
Yes, I need them very much. And if you ever say them I'll never let you take them back.
Yes, I'm glad.
Your tie. I never saw you wear one before.
Come here. Come on, now.
Leave now.
I'd know it, Eddie. I'd know. For God's sakes, what are you trying to do to me? I love you.
He went off someplace.
Why?
Please, Eddie, don't beg him.
Would you get off my back, Sarah? Once and for all, will you get out, will you GET OFF MY BACK?!
Yes sir, boy, they, heh, they say that old Fats just shoots the eyes right off them balls.
Nine ball.  Three ball.
My name is Robert.
My wife.
Yes.
You're not them.
Have you always had it?
Who?
Before... when I was one of them. I would look at this and it was just strangers.  Now I... remember.
Yes.
He wanted me to see -- he thinks I was -- infected by you.
I want to talk.  I just learned again.
That's fine.
I guess you could say that.
Do we have to?
I'll have to go to a new school -- again.
It's that time of year again. We should get a pretty good show out here.
And that one -- to the right of Rigel?
It was all made of stuff that's happened to you in the last few days.  The sand pit in back of the house, and the meteor shower, and meeting your teacher and the colonel at school, and being afraid of the new kids because you don't know them ...
I'm sorry, Mr. Gardner.  I was out of my office for a minute and when I got back -- he was gone.
I'm not particularly interested, <u>Ms.</u> Magnuson, in what you think is correct. My wife and I are going away on a business trip this afternoon and we want Jimmy with us.  Keep him in your office until we arrive.
Who are you calling?
Hide the car.
I know a way.
I don't know.  I don't know what I'm doing here --
Yes ... yes, but I'm not sure what I saw anymore.
They didn't find any signs of life on the Viking missions.
The back door was open.
I want you to leave with us. Right now.
He's not going to listen to me.
I wanted a career. Didn't you ever want to be part of something special?
We'll be well on our way out of there before we shoot that thing off.
Did it work?
My ex-husband works in satellite communications.
All he could think about was getting to you. There's still love there I think.
So sue me.
And the good news is you won't charge me.
...and we'll be the only guys in town with a clear picture? That's my man.
Huh? Oh, good, good.
Haven't you been watching?
I'm thinking.
Can't this thing go any faster?
I just haven't found it yet. I tried C. Halbrook, Connie Halbrook, Spunky Halbrook...
I want you should know, I'm very proud of you, son.
You as well.
It had been deemed classified.
Butt-munch.
I'm a dancer.
No. Exotic.
How to kiss ass.
I'm bringing home the bacon. Earning my keep. And doing a fine job if I do say so myself.
For once in your life think about what's best for Troy. Who has to beg for money to buy him medicine when you screw up? Who?
But, Mr. President...
Two words, Mr. President. Plausible deniability.
People are dying out there. I don't think "exciting" is the word I'd choose to describe it!
Oh, yes, of course. But where are we going?
Well done, Indy. Very well done, indeed. This will find a place of honor in our Spanish collection.
Call Donovan, Marcus. Tell him I'll take that ticket to Venice now.
Your father would know. Your father did know. Look. He made a map.
Marcus, get hold of Sallah. Tell him to meet you in Iskenderun.
It's... a leap of faith. Oh, God.
Got lost in his own museum, huh?
Don't worry. Doctor Schneider will be there to meet you.
The Holy Grail, Doctor Jones. The chalice used by Christ during the Last Supper. The cup that caught His blood at the Crucifixion and was entrusted to Joseph of Arimathaea.
What good is it? This Grail Tablet speaks of deserts and mountains and canyons. Pretty vague. Where do you start looking? Maybe if the Tablet were intact, you'd have something to go on. But the entire top portion is missing.
I've heard this one as well. Two of these brothers walked out of the desert one hundred and fifty years after having found the Grail and began the long journey back to France. But only one of them made it. And before dying of extreme old age, he supposedly imparted his tale to a -- to a Franciscan friar, I think.
All I have to do is scream.
I'm like a bad penny. I always turn up.
It's ours, Indy. Yours and mine.
I came to get you! What do you think?
I got it and I used it. We found the entrance to the catacombs.
There were rats, Dad.
So did I.
Try and burn through the ropes.
Don't get sentimental now Dad -- save it 'til we get out of here.
What?
Head for the fireplace!
I'm out, Dad!
What?
Brody's this way.
All right Dad -- tell me.
What about Marcus?
I don't know. The first available flight out of Germany.
That's not all we shared. It's disgraceful. You're old enough to be her fa... er, her grandfather!
I was the next man.
Hmmm... What did we talk about?
This could be close.
You call this archaeology?
Penitent. Penitent...
I'm not exactly... a knight. What do you mean?
I'll take the camels.
No.
My name is Kazim.
I didn't come for the Cup of Christ. I came to find my father.
It's like the voodoo dolls of West Africa. The kryta represents your enemy -- and gives you complete power over him.
You think so?
Did you discover anything in that tunnel, Dr. Jones?
I remember first hearing your name when I was studying at Oxford. I am Chattar Lal, Prime Minister for His Highness the Maharajah of Pankot.
No, no, that is Uhmed Singh, the present Maharajah's late father.
I'm afraid they'll kill them! We saw horrible things down there -- they had a human sacrifice and they ripped a man's heart out!
Sure, I found him. Then last night I had a little trouble. Somebody tried to slit my throat.
Next time I'll cut off more than his finger.
A bonus, Dr. Jones. That is poison. You just drank the rest of it.
Nope, you got a little surprise over there, Shorty.
You don't like him do you?
No.
Yeah, that's what happened...
Okay, Shorty... see you in the morning... I'm going to have a little -- word with Willie.
"Follow in the footsteps of Shiva. Do not betray his truth."
Why they glow like that?
Read you loud and clear, Indy!
Mola Ram -- you're about to meet Kali -- in Hell!
Hasn't the Pankot palace been deserted since the Mutiny of 1857?
What evil?
Hey, he's not a waiter...
Who cares? Where's that diamond!
Somehow I feel safer in here.
A SNAKE!!
Just one arm!
Oh really?
Yeah, I wish you'd thought of this sooner...
Wearing your jewels to bed, princess?
I'm a scientist. I like doing research on certain "nocturnal activities" --
No... the heart's still beating!
I'm not leaving without those stones.
They think I'm insane. Tell them I'm not, Indy. Please -- help me ...
What above the curves?!
You didn't do so well yourself. Finding that stone could've gotten you all the fortune and glory you were talking about.
You got it!
They don't cry about you. They cry about the elephants leaving.
Willie, come on!
What's going on?
Where are we now?
I'm trying to get you to listen to reason.
No.
Loading a gun.
If I get you back to the lab, will you get out of my head?
No. Don't tell the guards.
I am. You are.
You're the one talking to a little guy in your head.  ...We'll have to do it on our own.
Think of the scientific data we'll gain. Come on, lets get out of here.
Why don't you just get out, leave me alone.
What do you mean?
That's it. They know I'm in here. We've got to find them.
Don't know.
Composition of the sand, ...trace elements..unique...
Who cares?
Nothing, but it's yours. Change it. Change your whole persona.
You'll be me.
Just get there.
You eat it.
The sand.
Why not?
Where are you going? Wait!
What? What do you mean?
You're out of shape.
She's beautiful...! What do I do?
Don't just stand there, say something.
Anything. Aw hell...Just tell her the truth.
What?
Yeah. Some help. That poetry really killed her.
Rene...
But, you've got to have... sophistication ...savoir faire.
What's nothing look like? ...it looks like nothing.
This...is not going to work out.
Just hold them close and stay still.
I don't know what's going on.
Can't tell. Every time I try her, you look away. Or you make noises. Maybe you don't want to know.
What if she says something important?
It's not your time. I get time off.
That's good. It's not better. Where?
You said 100,000 yen for the right Sony Walkman.
Well...?
Aim what?
And don't let her know, either.
Well, don't let it. What are you doing?
Losing power. The laser drained it.
Now, you're too suspicious.
She's in love with you. Anyone can see that.
That's nice.
Don't worry.
Look, I don't know how we're gonna get out of this.
In my own way...I want you to know that...I love you.
It's a long story.
What a nerve!
Rene?
Doesn't matter. Then put him away.
We met on the beach.
It's just money.
He's not an ordinary man.
He's...more. Somehow, enhanced... He's...zxflbbgt!
We insist.
I came for a rest. As, I imagine, you did. To get away with it all.
I think I've heard of you.
What about it?
Oh...that's okay.
Remember what?
The little man in my...  ...head...
Been hearing voices.
A little voice in my head.
We have Henekin, Kirin... Very good, sir.
What's what?
Nothing.
I said...I didn't say..anything!
No. No one to speak of.
Yeah. One of the corniest lines I ever heard.
Where?
Do what?
...Rene.
I just work for the travel firm.
Me still. They left you alone?
That you're not crazy.
You talk to yourself.
Why do you do it?
You're doing...Okay.
...Naw. Made that up.
No one. No one at all. I'm unemployed. Who do you?
Is that Ryuji?
Why'd you run off?
They kidded me a little.
There's not much to tell.
No.
You did.
Food doesn't agree with me.
Why?
I'm sorry. What will you do?
What's he done?
What is it?
Get your things.
I asked him.
I said just relax. I'm in full control.
You coming along?
I can't fly it.
Her?
Now what?
If he was able, what would he say.
It keeps me busy. Everybody always wants something.
Why'd you invite me here?
Thanks.
Just one. The back up.
Poor bastard.
What does he know?
Whoever took it does.
Hi, Daddy.
She was playing with my Pooh doll again...
That remote control thing?
You better take a good look! Because I'm getting two things: pissed off and curious! Now, any of these guys been offered jobs in corporate security after they retire? Either one of those guys have ex-agent pals already in those jobs? Like, for instance, their ex-supervisor, who's already at Brown & Williamson as we fucking speak?
You got a deal. 
You bet we are. And I can't talk to you now.
Yeah. Catch you later.
Excuse me, Lowell. Sharon's on line 3.
...fuck is this? Fuck!
Well, what do you think I'm going to do? Quit in protest? I'm not going to do that.
No, you fucked you! Don't invert stuff! Big Tobacco tried to smear Wigand; you bought it. The Wall Street Journal, here, not exactly a bastion of anti-capitalist sentiment, refutes Big Tobacco's smear campaign as the lowest form of character assassination! And now, even now, when every word of what Wigand has said on our show is printed, the entire deposition of his testimony in a court of law in the State of Mississippi, the cat totally out of the bag, you're still standing here debating! Don, what the hell else... do you need?
I'm not touching my film...
Yes, sir. What caliber is your gun?
What about you, you got a crew already?
No, no, we're fine...
And, I'm told there are questions as to our "star witness'" veracity.
They own the information he's disclosing. The truer it is, the greater the damage to them. If he lied, he didn't disclose their information. And the damages are smaller.
You're getting ahead of yourself. We're all in this together. We're all CBS. We'll find out soon. Thank you, gentlemen.
Jim, it's Lowell.
Did I tell you you were wrong?
Yes, it's on the stove...
Where should I wash them?
Will he go on-camera and talk about the Mexico City branch?
..."ignition propensity?"  ...you understand any of this...?
They're pretending it's process. Bullshit, it's foregone.
Jeffrey...
So, it's a big country with a free press. You can go work somewhere else.
You're not listening.  Really know what you're going to do before you do it.
What's your interest in this, Mr. Bergman?
What "Seven Dwarfs?"
Good.
"Put the corporation at risk"...? Give me a fucking break!
No, I usually sit around in my hotel room, dressed like this at 5:30 in the morning, sleepy look on my face.
Oh, lots.
I'm going to tell you why. Because when I tell someone I'm going to do something, I deliver.
Like what? Corporate responsibility? What, are we talking celebrity here?
I did? What do I tell a source on the next tough story? Hang in with us. You'll be fine... maybe?
What I've seen... I've liked.
Because I think Hezbollah is trying to broaden into a political party right now. So you care about what you're thought of in America. And in America, at this moment in time, Hezbollah does not have a face.  That's why.
Just so I know you know, when I talk to people in confidence, it stays that way.
Far as you go where?
To straighten something out with you. Right here. Right now.
Johnson & Johnson. Union Carbide in Japan. I was general manager and director of new products. I speak Japanese. I was a director of corporate development at Pfizer. All health-related.  What else? Outside the "zone"...?
The seven CEOs of Big Tobacco... they got up in front of Congress that time... it was on television...
Marcuse. Yeah. He was my mentor. He had a major influence on the New Left in the late '60s... and on me, personally.
I'm not pushing you around!  I'm asking you questions.
I have to put my family's welfare on the line here, my friend! And what are you puttin' up? You're puttin' up words!
...they "volunteered." A friend owns a large security company.
Run that Sandefur piece on "nicotine's not addictive." Run that on-camera. Then cut right to Wigand with "I believe they perjured..." Then go wide to the CEOs all taking the oath. Back on Jeff and play the pause after the word "felt" on the B-side...
A can opener! A $39.95 can opener. I canceled payment... It was junk.  You ever bounce a check, Lowell? You ever look at another woman's tits? You ever cheat a little on your taxes?  Whose life, if you look at it under a microscope, doesn't have any flaws...?
What does this have to do with my testimony?
I told the truth... I told the truth.
And I've got to refute every fucking accusation made in this report before The Wall Street Journal runs.  I am trying to protect you, man!
Yeah. Yeah, I will.
Liane has filed for divorce...
Good to meet you, Dr. Wigand.
And, do you wish you hadn't come forward? You wish you hadn't blown the whistle?
It acts as a drug on the body?
Mr. Scruggs, Jeff Wigand. Lowell Bergman said I should give you a call...
When should we do this?
Seven...
He --
They hate each other --
Howard!
And -- there's no talking her out of it. Believe me, I've tried.
She said "penetrate." Heh heh heh.
We'd better go before we get thrown out.
Well -- Marylin and Rex broke up and...
Who's the pigeon?
Shut up. I was a lawyer. Just like you. And my clients? Whores just like you.
So. I won't be seeing her? Your clients usually visit me after the settlement.
Set one side for Bel Air.
I was going to play golf. You were going to have Asian girlfriends.
Oh. That.  Don't waste time with your queen.
No.
I can't have a baby with a man I don't love... And I can't submit a child to divorce.
Maybe they put a horse head in her bed?
Positano is beautiful. Remember when we were there, Rex? We stayed in the Santo Pietro? That hotel on the cliff?
You just haven't met the right person.
Have you ever met Mr. Rexroth?
Marylin! Listen to me.
Miles. Miles. Miles.
Although knowing you as I do -- there will be no settlement. This time it will be complete and total annihilation.
I don't feel victorious Miles. I feel betrayed, abandoned and humiliated. I have pictures of him with another woman...
No. Don't stop.
Yes. I just got that, actually. It was a gift.
What is it Miles?
Did you just propose to me?
I want this to be a marriage based on love, trust and community property. That's all I've ever wanted.
No. Stay. I want you close to me. This couch is wrong. It's not a "married couch."
I know. But I've converted most of them into ridiculous "Guy" rooms -- a billiard room, a card room, a gym -- Honey, want you to go out, as soon as you feel up to it -- and buy married things. Woman things. Personalize it. Marylinize it. Make this your house.
Miles.
Can you Marylin? Can you return the trust? Can you return the hopes? The dreams? Can you just...  SEND IT ALL BACK FOR STORE CREDIT?
You can't prove anything.
That's blackmail.
Yes. I know. It's exactly how I felt when I realized you'd hired the goon to kill...
Forgery? Fraud?
I thought so.
Marylin.
I didn't know Barry had a beach house.
By reputation. He got Ann Rumsey that cute little island of George's.
Oh, God!
Shit.
They bought her speech. If I was only in it for Rex's money, he shouldn't have to give me any.
Hello Miles.
It's not Ming. It's Tong.
At this point my client is still prepared to consider reconciliation.
Heh heh.
Yes. Maybe you're right, Miles. Maybe we're being too conservative. Seventy five percent.
Kirshner does not apply. Kirshner was in Kentucky.
Don't give me that crap. That's MY crap.
Rex, please.
Mm.
Maybe I should reconsider my...
HA!
The plastic surgeon! I read about you in LA Style.
Who's "Patty."
"I found a million dollar baby-"
If I didn't I wouldn't be here!  I've got it all itemized. 
And this is what you want-thirty- nine dollars and sixty cents?
Yes, I know-but-
The reward.
I'm afraid I'm a little confused. You see, I assumed you were coming here for-
Why don't you put me in chains?
Yes. I know.  Because I'm your daughter and you love me. Because you don't want me to make any mistakes. Because-
Please. I can't fight on an empty stomach. Remember what Napoleon said.
South America.
Stunt?
Nothing. 
On the road.
Yessir. She refuses them all.
Yes, of course.
Any others?
Amateurs!
"Young people in love Are very seldom hungry. People in love Are very seldom hungry . . ."
What're you gonna do about the papers? Somebody's gotta pick 'em up.
Now, that's a brilliant answer. Why didn't I think of it? Our conversation could have been over long ago.
Why, that's ridiculous! They're responsible for everything that-
Yes.
You're doing a pretty sloppy job of it.  Here's your ticket.
If you play your cards right, you might get some money out of it. 
Forget it. I didn't do it for you. His voice got on my nerves.
Oh, this?-I like privacy when I retire. I'm very delicate in that respect. Prying eyes annoy me.  Behold the walls of Jericho![4] Maybe not as thick as the ones that Joshua blew down with his trumpet, but a lot safer. You see, I have no trumpet.  Now just to show you my heart's in the right place, I'll give you my best pair of pajamas.
You're not really serious about this, are you?
Outside!
I know a couple of truck drivers I'd like to have you meet sometime.  Come on, sit down.
Just shows you how wrong a guy can be. Doughnut?
No. No. It's too good a story.
Yeah?
Oh. Is that how you met him?
You weren't so bad yourself.
Don't be silly. Nothing you can do. Must be tough on an old woman-a trip like this.
What's the matter?
Sorry.  It's the first time I've ridden "piggy-back" in years.
That's silly.
I can't forget it. I'm still hungry.
know-but-
I hate the horrid stuff.
Amazing.
Now watch me. I'm going to use Number One. Keep your eye on that thumb, baby, and see what happens.
You're such a smart aleck! Nobody can do anything but you. I'll show you how to stop a car-and I won't use my thumb.
Darling!
Okay.  Cottage Number Three.
I heard about your stunt. That's swell, King. Just think of it-the groom lands on the lawn with a plane. It's a perfect beginning for the life we're going to lead. It sets just the right tempo.  Come on, King. You're lagging. 
Eight o'clock! Why, that's twelve hours!
Thank you.
If you don't get out of here, I'll slap that fresh mouth of yours.
Bridge washed out-around Dawson.
What!  Say, listen you!  When you get back to New York, take my advice and stay f-a-r away from this office-unless you don't care what happens to that funny map of yours. 
Wait a minute, Gordon-I-
Never mind . . . Listen-suppose I should tell you that Ellen Andrews is going to have her marriage annulled.
Well, I got it, Joe.
Yeah.
Great!  But that's the way things go. You think you got a swell yarn-then something comes along-messes up the finish-and there you are.
When you sober up-come in and see me.
Yeah?
He looked like an upright young feller to me, Ma.
Thanks. 
What?
Yeah. Just babies.
Oh, gee, Mister-you wouldn't-you ain't thinkin' about-
Al, you can't tell a mink from a coonskin unless you see the fur up close.  Goddamn, Sam!  If we don't start reading between the lines here! Y'all gotta start thinking on a different level - like the CIA does. We're through the looking glass. Here white is black and black is white.
The interesting thing is the extent to which the Warren Commission went to make him a Communist.  They got almost 150 pages and 130 exhibits of the report on this Mexico trip and the picture doesn't even match.  I'm beginning to think the point of the Mexican episode was to lay the blame at Castro's door.  If Oswald, or someone purporting to be Oswald, had gotten into Cuba, come back, then killed the President, the American public once again would've screamed for a Cuban invasion...
You tell them the day after the assassination you were called on the phone by this "Clay Bertrand" and asked to fly to Dallas and be Lee Oswald's layer.
Always - like tits on a pig.  I wish I had a million of those bimbettes.
God's sake, chief.  The President was shot.
I think I'll cut out here, chief.  I gotta get home.
I'm just an investigator, Bill.  I leave the theories to you lawyers.
Keep saying what?
Who is he, Joe?  I've been to every bar, no one wants to talk.
What's the other name?
Y'ever heard of a double agent, Bill? I'm beginning to doubt Oswald was ever a Communist... after the arrest, 544 Camp Street never appeared on the pamphlets again.  Now here's another one for you:  What would you say if I told you Lee Oswald had been trained in the Russian language when he was a Marine?
Oh Jesus, Stoner!... Why doesn't he call me?
Where you going, boss?
So for those reasons, you're going to trial against Clay Shaw, chief? Well, you're gonna lose!  We should be investigating all our Mafia leads here in New Orleans - Carlos Marcello, Santos Trafficante - I can buy that a hell of a lot easier than the Government.  Ruby's all Mob, knows Oswald, sets him up.  Hoffa - Trafficante - Marcello, they hire some guns and they do Kennedy and maybe the Government doesn't want to open up a whole can o'worms there because it used the Mob to get to Castro.  Y'know, Castro being assassinated sounds pretty wild to John Q.  Citizen.  So they close the book on J.F.K.  It makes sense to me.
Boss, are you calling the President a murderer?
Yeah.  Come on, Dave, come on our side.  I guarantee you the boss'll protect you...  Dave?
I don't have much time.  They don't even need bugs anymore.  They got these fuckin' satellite waves.  They put a bug in a friend of mine when he was born, right up his nostrils, subcutaneous, between his eyes.  He was one of those products of a crossbreading experiment.  A Nazi rocket scientist father and a Commie spy mother.  You'd never believe half the shit the Agency does.  I'm so fuckin' tired.  Haven't slept since that shit article came out. Why'd you guys have to go and get me involved with this?
How could I?  Dave, as you know, President Kennedy was assassinated on Friday.  A man named Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested as a suspect and then was murdered yesterday by a man named Jack Ruby.  We've heard reports that Oswald spent the summer in New Orleans and we've been advised you knew Oswald pretty well.
I'm sure you've seen this.  Perhaps you knew this man under another name?
Well that must've been mistaken information we got.  Thanks for straightening it out for us.  There is one other matter that's come up, Dave.  We were told you took a trip to Texas shortly after the assassination of Friday.
I see.  And where did you drive?
Why Galveston?
But the boys told us they didn't get any.
I see.  Dave thank you for your time.  I'm sorry it has to end inconveniently for you, but I'm going to have you detained for further questioning by the FBI.
Oh man, why don't you stop.  This is too fuckin' big for you!  Who did Kennedy?  It's a mystery wrapped in a riddle inside an enigma.  Even the shooters don't fuckin' know!  Don't you get it yet?  I can't be talking like this.  They're gonna kill me. I'm gonna die!  I don't know what happened.  All I wanted in the world was to be a Catholic priest - live in a monastery, study ancient Latin manuscripts, pray, serve God.  But I had this one terrible, fatal weakness.  They defrocked me.  And then I started to lose everything.
Dave, it's going to be okay.  Just talk to us on the record and we'll protect you.  I guarantee it.
Get some rest, Dave, and you'll feel better in the morning.  We'll talk then.
Well I heard Dr. Humes stating that - he said...
If that's your case, you didn't have a case.  I wouldn't believe whatever Habighorst said, anyway.
Well, it looks like it, Jasper.
Well if they can kill the President, they can certainly get me.
The truth is that I heard between four and six shots.  I'm not going to lie for you.
None!  The State Department issues him a new passport in 48 hours and loans him the money to travel.  He's never investigated or charged by the Navy for revealing classified information or, as far as we know, debriefed by the CIA.
Presumably so he can now exercise his intellect stacking school texts at $1.25 an hour.
I wonder about the Williams'.  Just where did the first description of Oswald come from at 12:44?  No one knows.  They claimed it was Brennan's, but his description came after 1 P.M.  Who called?  Somehow the FBI's been tapping the Williams' and picks up a call between Bell Helicopter and Janet's phone, an unidentified voice saying "We both know who's responsible."  Who called?  Why's the Bureau been tapping them?
No, I don't think I am, Susie.  Anyone else?
A Willie O'Keefe?
Mr. O'Keefe told us he met you at the Masquerade Bar down in the Quarter and several evenings later you had him over for dinner at your apartment on Dauphine Street.  Do you recall that?
I'm well aware of this asinine article.  And I am thinking very seriously of suing this rag of a newspaper.
Well maybe you're right, Jim.  I'll give you one hour to solve the case... until the kids are in bed.  Then you're mine and Mr. Kennedy can wait 'til morning.  Come on, everybody say goodnight to Daddy.
But why in the Lord's name would you do it in the middle of Easter Sunday when you knew we were...
Leave us ALONE for God's sake!  ...Oh, it's Lou.
You and your government!  What's the matter with you?  Don't you have any feelings?  Your daughter!  What kind of man are you?
Call me Willie.  I ain't got nuthin' but time, Mr. Garrison.  Minutes, hours, days, years of'em.  Time just stands still here like a snake sunnin' itself in the road...
No word yet.  But they think it's in the head.
He's been in trouble before.  Used to be a hot shot pilot for Eastern Airlines, but he got canned after an alleged homosexual incident with a 14-year old boy.
Upstairs.  In 1963 that was the Office of Naval Intelligence - And just by coincidence, Banister, before he was FBI, was ONI.  What do they say?
I can't say that comes as a surprise anymore.
Why not just shoot Kennedy coming up Houston?  There's plenty of time - he's out in the open - a frontal shot?
Beats me.  City officials.  Secret Service.  Dallas police.  They did a dry run with Chief Curry a few days before.  But they didn't bother running through Dealey.  They stopped right there, said something like, "and afterwards there's only the freeway," and went home.
No.
Who?
The Warren Commission call him?
If I were investigatin', I'd round up the 100 best riflemen in the world and find out which ones were in Dallas that day.  You been duck hunting?  I think Oswald was a good old-fashioned decoy.  What'd he say?  "I'm just a patsy."  Out of the mouth of babes y'ask me.
Russell, honestly you sound like one of those kooky critics spreading paranoia like prairie fire.  I just can't believe the Chief Justice of the United States would put his name on something that wasn't true.
Yes.
Kings are killed, Mr. Garrison. Politics is power, nothing more. But don't believe me.  Don't trust me.  Do your own work, your own thinking.
No chance in hell, Mr. Garrison. I'd be arrested and gagged, declared insane and hospitalized... maybe worse.  You, too.  I can only give you background, you got to find the foreground, the little things... Keep digging.  Y'know you're the only person to ever bring a trial in the murder of John Kennedy.  That's important - it's historic.
...some story... the whole thing. It's like it never happened.
Never touched me.
If you buy what you read in the paper.
Banister was running his camp north of Lake Pontchartrain.  Ferrie handled a lot of the training.  There was a shooting range and a lot of tropical terrain like in Cuba.  A few Americans got trained, too.  Nazi types. Mercenaries.  But Ferrie was the craziest.
Hold on, Jack.  What's the problem?
Even your own wife, Numa.  Any of you want to quit, do me a favor... put us out of our misery.
I expected that two months ago, and they're wasting their time... The bad news is the National Guard has just asked me to resign after 18 years.  Well, maybe that's good news - it was never as good as combat, but this is.  Bill, any more on Oswald and Shaw?
Germany.
I imagine because this is the Criminal District Court Building  This is an enlargement of a potential shooter standing behind the picket fence.  We...
The job manages to keep me pretty busy.
Uh huh.
Are you kidding, it looks great. You wear this to a business meeting, you're the badass in the room. But you can go out dancing in this too. It's a total power suit.
Then say "Yes, Max. I understand."
Who was there for your ass?
Three years.
That's not what they're tellin' me.
I'm gonna sell the other two tonight. This group of Koreans in Koreatown have started a Neighborhood Watch kinda thing. And they want a few weapons so the neighborhood niggas know they mean business. So I'm gonna sell 'em my two machine guns tonight. Only problem, I ain't never dealt with these Koreans before. Now I ain't worried. Asians are by and large real dependable. They don't want no trouble. You might argue about price, but you ain't gotta worry about them shootin' you in the back. But I got me kind of a rule. Never do business with nobody you ain't never done business with before without backup. That's why I need you, backup.
What the fuck I tell you. You don't hafta shoot nobody. Just hold the gun. They'll get the idea.
Well, if you owe me, git your ass in the trunk.
Can she afford a good one is the question. Otherwise she'll be in Sybill Brand three weeks easy before the Public Defender gets around to her.
She wants to make a deal.
She almost sounds scared.
The usual things. I'm a flight attendant with Cabo Air.
I'm not saying another word.
That's my diet shit.
'Course I do -- I deliver money for him.
Fine.
Sure, ever been to the Riverbottom?
I thought you might want a drink?
Ten pounds. I lose it and put it back on.
What's your brand?
Sure.
Ordell pick up his bond?
The federal agent kinda half hinted Ordell might of done Beaumont.
Give 'em what you got. Offer to help. Show a willingness to be helpful. You want to stay out of jail, don't you?
You went out this morning and bought a gun?
You went out this morning and bought a gun.
Why?
You're not old. You look great.
Okay, I'm a little sensitive about my hair. It started falling out ten years ago. So I did something about it.
What'd ya see?
How was it?
I don't care.
I go back to work tomorrow.
They seem to like the idea.
He always just picked it up at my place. But with A.T.F. involved, I want to stage it. You know, make it look more intriguing, like we know what the fuck we're doin'. Then it's up to Ray Nicolet, the A.T.F. guy to follow the shopping bag.
Why?
The day you got me out of jail?
He never came home. But I'm sitting on the couch, in the dark, holding my stun gun and the whole house smells of mildew -- So after a couple hours I think, "What am I doing here? Nineteen years of this shit? So I made up my mind, that's it.
So how do we give Ordell to Nicolet?
Set him up.
Thank you for saying that, but no. My business.
I'm just tired in general.
Well, that's the State's offer. If you plead to possession and tell L.A.P.D. what they want to know, your bond will be set at one-thousand dollars. If you don't, L.A.P.D. will request one at twenty-five thousand based on your prior record and risk of flight. If you don't post it or don't know anyone who can, you'll spend six to eight weeks in County before your arraignment comes up.
Do you live together?
Then you don't see him for a few days?
If I'm working, I can help you.
No.
I thought you were going to let this one through.
Ever meet her, or they talk about her?
And splittin' with her?
She told you that?
I was told ten thousand in each pack.
After all, it don't belong to nobody, right?
But you didn't do that.
I had to. I was frantic. I didn't know what to do.
I went looking for you. I went straight to the bookstore, 'cause that's where you were last time, but you weren't there. How the hell else am I supposed to let anybody know what happened? You didn't tell me how to do that, did you? I knew I was under surveillance, so when I couldn't spot anybody, I started yelling.
You'd take a polygraph on it?
I thought you were watching him.
Good luck. That guy's been in there since I got here.
Dreaming.
Hi, Melanie.
Yeah, do you like it?
Do you got something for me?
Sure.
Hey, you get caught with blow, that's your business.
They asked.
I said I wanted to talk to a lawyer.
I didn't tell 'em anything.
Shut your raggedy ass up and sit down.
I do okay.
I told them you got a half a million dollars in Mexico, and you want me to bring it here.
And they follow the wrong one thinkin' she's bringing it to me.
Uh-huh.
I ain't gonna send no roc whore. The woman's cool, I promise.
I need to talk to you alone.
She don't know shit about the money.
I told her this is a game us rich folks play, exchanging gifts. Like a scavenger hunt. She didn't know what that was neither.  No answer?
Designer clothes.
I can sit through it once.
Sure.
What's a Metrix?
No thanks.
Detroit.
Must of made quite an impression.
No.
Does that bother you?
Fuck you. I can carry it.
Okay, you got it. Just take a chill pill, for christ sake.
This one.
Okay, Lou-is.
Who's your partner?
I dunno.
The moon -- I dunno
You're outside?
C'mon in.
So we on the same page then?
Sure.
Melanie must be dyin' to see it.  Louis.
I shot her.
You know how she is.
Pretty sure.
You said five hundred and fifty!
Maybe a minute. She came right out.
Look, I swear to fucking god, she came out with that bag and I took it from her.
That's right.
It's in there.
Hold on a minute.  Where you going?
Where would you like me to put my ash?
They ran his name and got a hit. He's been in before.
Livingston, huh?
Yes.
They fuckin' wit' her. They callin' it Possession with Intent. A black woman in her forties gets busted with less than two ounces on her, they call that shit Intent. Same shit happened to a movie star. It's Possession.
Hear what?
What does she do for you?
Was she?
If I don't see it in front of me, you're right. It ain't shit.
She got off, huh?
You expect me to just walk in there?
I know where to turn.
Uh-huh.
It's Beaumont.
'Ola!
I was gonna tell you...
No problem.
Where do you want to go?
What are you then?
No! The army did this to me! They've done something to my brain.  Jezzie! I want my boys! Sarah! I'm not dead! I want my family!
Just to see you. That's all.
Yeah, ever since that ...
You know, I've been to three shrinks and a hypnotist. Nothing penetrates that night. Nothing.
Stop!!!!
What do you want from me?
I could have told you that.
There's nothing to expose.
They're not interested, Jake.
Maybe it's not the army, Jake.
Don't bother to call again, okay?
It was the window.
Then why aren't you teaching? Why aren't you in a university?
You need ... a doctor.
What else did he say, Jake?
How long had that been going on?
I was absent the day they taught that in school. What did she say?
You should go back to her.
I had to get in there. A deep adjustment. Rest a moment and let it set a bit.
I know.
Demons, Jacob? Why demons? Are you writing ... ?
I don't know what to say.
Damn it. I was in the veteran's out- patient program. He knows me.
Jacob Singer.
Whataya mean, no record?
This is healthy? I'll probably die of pneumonia tomorrow and this is healthy.
No. Of course you're not. You've just hurt your back. That's all. You're going to be fine. It'll just take some time.
No. Don't move me.
Where is the lamp?
Thanks.
What do you mean?
Don't ask.
I don't let anybody call me that.
A good lay.
Jake, you are never out of your head!
Pictures. Your wife was gonna toss 'em so "what's his name" brought 'em over on his way to school.
Not to me.
How's it going?
Now? What about the boss? He's not gonna like it.
What does that have to do with anything? Does it explain the barricaded subway stations? Does it explain those Godforsaken creatures?
They're like demons, Jez.
Those guys tried to kill me tonight. They were aiming right at me.
Where?
It's gone to the top.
You're red hot, damn it. Get in there. I've got to get more ice.
You are the most unbelievable woman I have ever met. One second you're a screaming banshee and the next you're Florence Nightingale. Who are you? That's what I want to know. Will the real Jezzie Pipkin please stand up.
In a way. At least now I have some idea of what was happening. If we can only get them to admit ... to explain what they did ... I don't know. Maybe it'd clear things up in my head. I'll tell you something, Jez, honestly ... I thought they were real.
What's he talking about?
I can do anything I want.
It might be for me.
I'm gonna make love to you. That's what I'm gonna do.
I tell you, it was so wonderful. I felt like a little boy. I saw Paradise, Jezzie.
It's over, Jake. It's all over.
How many times have you asked me that? How many times?
With wings.  You transport me, you know that? You carry me away.
What do you want me to say? My mother's tummy?
I'm not upset.
Goddamn it. Why do you say that?
Don't play games with me. There's nothing more to say.
What's wrong, Jake?  Forget to take your antidote?
I don't get it. Who are you? Why have you been following me?
Shows how much you knew.
Yeah, sure. We were losing the war.
What is it?
I don't know.
Just relax.
That's what I'd like to know. If you see him on the street somewhere, tell him he's fired.
You come near me and I'll blow us all up.
I'm awake?
That's a lie. My family was here.
Of course it is. What else could it be?
Nothin' much.
No joke. Fuckin' army! That goddamn war. I'm still fightin' it.
You can't talk in Brownsville?
Who, Paul? What exactly ... ?
I don't know what to do.
You've seen them?
She said I haven't been the same since then. Since that night. There's still this big hole in my brain. It's so dark in there, Jake. And these creatures. It's like they're crawling out of my brain. What happened that night? Why won't they tell us?
Died?
You got lucky.
Pause play.
Yes it does.
Yeah yeah I better call the labs, see what the hell is going on.
What do you mean, not enough time?
Then break it! If you don't pull it, the ship's going to depressurize!
If the ship goes, so does Jaso.
We don't have a choice!
Rizzo did.
He....He...
He came for me, I had to run!
I think I broke my arm.
Then you better hurry. I'll blow alley one, Delongpre, you and Rizzo take there. Janessa you ready two and we'll meet up there.
Thorgan, suit up.
Faster! Don't we have another gun?
You got that right.
At least try to get him alive...will ya Brodski?
Damnit! You scared the hell out of me!
Yllo's dead. We...we thought you were too.
I'm pulling, damnit!
Isn't there an escape POD on this ship? Something?
Med-kit?
What if we don't?
That's a good fantasy, though. Kinky, but good.
So, you thought you'd be cool. Go against your father's wishes? Yeah, that's grown up.
Well, we'd be dead without you. You know that, don't you?
No I'm not okay! I don't know what the hell I'm doing!
Oh great...yeah, having a great time, and you?
I'd want her statements before we reach porch. Jesus, women.
She's obviously dealt with this guy before.
GO, GO, GO!
Would you?
You're leaving me here alone?
Later.
Are you crazy?! Pull the lever!
Teleportation? Some way to beam us the hell out of dodge?
Cybernetics science droid, fluent in over six...
You need to get laid!
Hold your breath. Initial cryo gasses will render you unconcious.
Am I in there?
A real mamma's boy that one. Dissed his mamma and he nearly threw a tantrum. Little good it did him.
Oh, goody. I'm so pleased. I'd clap if I could.
I just know.
But?!!
If you're for real, you're looking at a million credits for viewing rights alone. Doesn't include touring and guest lectures. When can you get them here?
See you then . . . doctor.
You're crazy!
What have I done?! Idiots.
Exactly.
It's okay.
I'm authorized by the township of Amity to hire you as an independent contractor. We'll meet your price. $10,000.
You got it.
I know who he is...
What do you mean 'We...?'
...'cause this is where he lives. You gotta think like they do.
What do we do? Get some help? Radio in?
Tattoo. Had it taken off.
Have to pump her steady, s'all.
He's taken him!
Oh, yeah.  How do I look? Older, huh?
Older, sillier.
Here? You gotta be kiddin'.
Where is he?
Michael! Come inside!
Thank you.
No. Home here.
What'll I tell the kids?
All I'm saying is that Amity is a summer town -- we need summer dollars, and if they can't swim here, they'll use the beaches at Cape Cod, or Long Island.
What kind of a shark did you say it was?
Larry, we can re-open the beaches in August.
My kids were on that beach...
You're tellin' me. I swear, this town has gone crazy.
What stinks so bad?
What do we do?
Sometimes.  Look here -- something big, probably a school of mackerel clumped together. And staying right with us.
Be careful, for chrissake.
A White! A Great White, I found a tooth buried in the hull. He must've attacked... I knew it... Gardner's dead in there. I didn't see the mate...
A shark's attack is stimulated by the kind of splashing and activity that occurs whenever humans go swimming -- you can't avoid it!
I just pulled a shark tooth the size of a shot glass out of the hull of a wrecked boat out there.
I wish it would rain...
This is quite a place.
You were on the Indianapolis? In '45? Jesus...
No...  You think we can get back with those?
I can't imagine why.
I didn't know her.
A thousand apiece, something like that. There's five of us. And we each kick in a hundred a week for beer and cleaning, stuff like that.
I agree. If she's going to advertise, I wouldn't recommend out-of-town papers. Amity people could take care of this.
It's only two-thirty. What, are you tired?
Screw lamb -- let's shoot the sirloin!
I just found out about it -- but there's a bunch of Boy Scouts in the water a coupla miles down the coast from where we found the girl. Avril Bay, thereabouts. Chief went to dry them off.
I've got all these signs here...
I'll see ya. Tell Dorothy hello.
'U.S.S Indianapolis.' 1944.
Let's just cut him open and see what's inside...
Look, maybe this is the wrong time to pursue this, but I'm not sure...
I don't have it.
I'm not hungry, oddly.
I don't know...
I thought I might, you know, nip it in the bud before it gets worse. Because I heard in health class that pregnancy often results in an infant.
I'll see you at school, O.K.?
But you copy my work every week.
I just wanted to come over. You know, say hi. I miss hanging out with you on school nights.
Yeah. Um, I hooked up a whole private adoption thing. These married people in Saint Cloud are going to be the parents.
I always think you're cute. I think you're beautiful.
Yeah. Sure. Once Tino gets a new drumhead we should be good to go.
I totally heard you did.
What?
Like I'd marry you! You would be the meanest wife of all time. And anyway, I know you weren't bored that day because there was a lot of stuff on TV. The Blair Witch Project was on Starz, and you were like, "Oh, I want to watch this, but we should make out instead. La la la."
Yeah. That was me.
Because they're your fave. And you can never have too much of your favorite one-calorie breath mint.
Basically, I'm completely smitten with you, and I don't care if I'm making an ass out of myself right now, because you've seen me make an ass out of myself a million times, and you still want to be my friend.
That's all I need from you. That's more than I could ever ask for. You're just golden, dude.
I just see a lot of teenage mothers come through here. It's obviously a poisonous environment for a baby to be raised in.
No... I guess not.
Junebug, that is a tough, tough thing to do. Probably tougher than you can understand right now.
Listen, Bren-duhhh, I think you're the one overstepping boundaries. You're acting like you're the one who has to go through this and get huge and push a baby out of your vag for someone else. Besides, who cares if he's married? I can have friends who are married.
You don't know anything about me!
It really didn't hurt that bad having him.
I'm a junior.
Oh. Uh, my stepmom took me to the doctor yesterday and they said I was twelve weeks.
Yes they are, Josh. Since Mankato, they have been lying eyes.
Commercials.
You're kidding!
Oh, is he bald and amorphous?
That's what you think. I drink tons of booze so you might get one of those scary neuter-babies that's born without junk.
You know... it's parts...
I didn't. But it's a three-way tie between the Stooges, Patti Smith and the Runaways.
Well, sort of. Vanessa likes Madison for a girl.
God, pretentious much? I guess everyone should have a mysterious name like Juno, huh?
Why?
Well, when you're used to the raw power of Iggy and the Stooges, everything else sounds kind of precious by comparison.
I actually know this one.
You've never been to a dance, have you?
What?
No?
I want you guys to adopt the Buglet. I wanted everything to be perfect. Not shitty and broken like everyone else's family. Listen, once I have the baby, Vanessa is going to finally be happy, and everything will be all right. Believe me on this one!
I don't know. I just liked being your friend. I sort of liked becoming furniture in your weird life.
No thanks. I'm off pills.
Well, you're lucky it's not you.
Nothing...
Doesn't it look like it's waving? It's kind of like it's saying "Hi, Vanessa. Will you be my mommy?"
Naah. I'm already pregnant, so they figure nothing worse could happen to me. I gotta bounce anyway. It was nice seeing you guys again.
Just, you know, shopping with my girlfriends.
No, no, I'm definitely not asking for anything. Except maybe mercy. Like, it would be really great if nobody hit me.
The baby? I don't know anything about it yet. I only know it's got fingernails, allegedly.
No, it's not. Paulie is virile, by the way. He was very good in... chair.
Yeah, well, there's this couple who've been trying to have a baby for five years.
I have no idea what kind of girl I am.
Well, no... I'm not going to sell the baby. I just want it to grow up with people who are ready to love it and be parents. I'm in high school, dude. I'm ill-equipped.
You mean like couples?
Either I just pissed my pants or...
Silencio! I just drank my weight in Sunny D. and I have to go, pronto.
I don't know. It's not... seasoned yet. Wait. Huh. Yeah, there's that pink plus sign again. God, it's unholy.
No it's Morgan Freeman. Got any bones that need collecting?
It was magnificent, man!
I couldn't do it, Leah! It smelled like a dentist in there. They had these really horrible magazines, with, like, spritz cookie recipes and bad fiction and water stains, like someone read them in the tub. And the receptionist tried to give me these weird condoms that looked like grape suckers, and she told me about her boyfriend's pie balls, and Su-Chin Kuah was there, and she told me the baby had fingernails. Fingernails!
Bleeker and I were going to go to Gettysburg for spring break.
Yeah, but it sucks for free.
There's a guy in here who's giving away a piano. Free for the hauling! We should put it in Bleeker's yard.
Hey, I'm a sacred vessel. All you've got in your belly is Taco Bell!
Or stage parents!
Share the love, Tits!
Of the Penny Saver Lorings?
Right, seriously.
God, Spermy. Must you always feed?
Almost eight. You wouldn't believe how weird I look naked.
Trust me, you don't. I actually have to wear a bra now. And I have to rub this nasty cocoa butter stuff all over myself or my skin could get stretched too far and explode.
Keith's hot.
There's no way in hell they're having sex or even holding hands.
Yeah, well, Bleek trusted me. We're best friends.
Well, I was born to be a mother. Some of us are.
Are you looking for any other compensation?
Why do people think yellow is gender- neutral? I don't know one man with a yellow bedroom.
Or you could just wait a couple months. It's not like the baby's going to storm in here any second and demand dessert-colored walls.
I just think it's too early to paint. That's my opinion.
Hm.
Just thinking if this is really the right thing for us.
Of course we're ready. We've taken all the classes. The nursery. The books --
Looks like it, yeah.
Me neither. How 'bout you Carrie?
Adele... we gotta do something before Early kills someone else.
...Yeah.
He whips you?
It's a portfolio of my work.
Yeah I left him with the car... We're all squared up now.
As many times as it takes.
Oh... I do some work up at the Merrick Mirror factory, or I used to...
It's just a work in progress, kinda rough.
He almost always killed strangers. Spent years moving on from one place to another. That made it real hard to track him down.
...Then some.
Dahlia, no.
Some people think it's because he never killed again. He just disappeared back into society.
Ain't you goin' to record it?
Nah... how much money have you got?
It's about fucking time, Kessler! I'd just about given up on you.
Real polite. Kept calling me 'sir.'
Lighten up...
You try, I'm gonna pretend they're with somebody else.
Maybe he wasn't allowed to leave! Geezus Brian!
Okay, it was a cheap thrill, it was stupid, I admit it, alright?  But let's not blow this. Not now... Let's just get the photos.
I tried talking to her at the mine. It didn't work.
Not yet.
Listen, Eric's been "finishing" his for over three years now.
...Brian hurt his foot.
No.
Everybody just shut up!
He wasn't going to shoot her, you murdering son of a bitch!
...You're hurting me...
Where would we find him?
Well now I'd say that's the least of Mr. Diebold's problems.
Umm. Altogether?
With four of them, I didn't use any kind of protection. Wait, maybe it was three.
Umm. Three I believe. But I'm not sure.
Yes!
Hell's yeah. She was so clean.
What do you want?
I want to knock her guard down. I mean there's a whole philosophy behind it. Having a virgin suck your dick, that's basic because there's nothing lost.
The cartoon?
Yeah.
Right.
Yep.
Yeah.
I guess so. I gotta stop off home too.
Why I give pennies?
Why not? You stink.
Don't look for him. He's doing fine. He's gotta girl. He's fuckin' her right now in Steven's parents' room. So do ya know Joe.
Na.
Yeah me too.
Yeah. Do it again.
Come on bitch. Throw your fists up.
Hey. What are you doin' right now?
Come on.
Bang up stuff.
Yeah.
You want to fuck me. But you can't fuck me.
Because I'm a virgin and I don't want no baby.
I guess so.
One.
You're OK?
No.
Yeah?
Hello Paul. Is Telly inside?
Of course. How am I gonna forgive him after what he did?!
I didn't bleed.
Good luck.
Because he can like climax you up to that...
Have you ever swallowed it before?
But then the sex gets into the way and you're like: What happened! What the hell happened?!
He still does.
What?!
Shh.
Nothing. We just wanted to come by and see what you were up to.
It's grandmother style.
Chess tournaments can be boring sometimes.  People have a lot of free time.  They like to gossip.
It means, if I were a killer and I thought the police were closing in on me I might invent someone to try and put them off the scent.
You like to play games, don't you, Peter?
He says it's a game.  All games have a strategy.
How'd you get in here?
I want you to feed every street in this grid into your computer.
Run it down.
Local?
Could someone this disturbed give the appearance of being normal?
She's unconscious, but they think she's going to make it.
Sanderson?
Did anyone stand out?
Did anyone look suspicious?  Think!
I haven't got time for this.
Just a second.  Hello?
Yes.  Why did you kill Debi Rutlege?
We all have paths to follow.  You hope yours will lead you to me.
You don't want to think and that's why I'll win!  I'm already two points ahead.
I really wish you'd stop trying to maneuver me.  I find it irritating, not to mention insulting.
Then call them!
So is mine, within the framework of my rules.
You heard me.  Why did you go out to the institute looking for her?
Very good.
I'm beginning to think it doesn't mean anything.  Remember eventually revenge- -
You sonofabitch!
I've figured out the message.
You don't understand.
They took away the game because of him. My father left and my mother...  There was so much blood... It covered everything.
Oh, I put a few games on for your daughter.  I hope you don't mind.
Can we correlate data?  Look for specific things, like player's ages... stuff like that?
Have computer search for anyone that's used that opening against me.  There can't be more than a handful.
Never mind.  He died two years ago.
You still haven't figured it out, have you?   You think that I've put you through an ordeal.  My scars run so much deeper than yours.
The scars on your chest.  From where I stabbed you with my fountain pen.
--the same type as the girl who got killed.  Jesus, Alan, the guy could be a psychopath.
I'm just nervous.  Sorry.
Of course.
How do you know that?  Did he say something?
I can't sleep.  My beds lumpy.
No Frank.  No prints.
There's only two hardware stores on the whole Island.  We'll check that out. What about the blood?
I'd say at least eighteen hours.
We're not sure.
It's important.
Yes.  Why not just say a building if he meant any general type of structure?
Only in passing.  To say hello to.
It doesn't make sense.
But he had to dump the body there to make the move.
Wait a minute.  There's an apartment in that area called the Castle Arms.
It's over, Peter.  Let's stop the games.  I'm not sending a car.
He knows you're aware of that.
No.
What are they, please?
Uh huh.
When I was very young.
Not really.  You see your goal and you go after it.  Anything that gets in the way is an obstacle and must be destroyed.
Chess is a reflection of life.  Life is violent.  The strong win.  The weak perish.
I see.  This is going to be a very polite conversation.  What shall we discuss?  The weather?  Movies?
Nothing.  I just came in for a steam.
No.  But I'm open to distractions.
I'm sorry.
I'm just trying to get to know you, Peter.
What are you talking about?  You don't even know me.
But what does he mean by a fierce magazine?  Violent?
Can I come in?
I'm not looking for an apology, Peter.
You don't understand.
Maybe you're afraid of what it says.
Frank told me.
Oh. That.  I know what you mean.  I had nightmares all week.
We're not married <u>yet</u>.
All directions are the same here.
Yes.
I won't leave you here.
The deeper she goes, the harder it is to contact her. Once she is below the second level, you will not be able to reach her at all.
I'm not sure.
You will tell me her name and we will go together.
The Beast will kill her.
Lyssa, your bracelets. Bend them straight and cross them.
What will happen?
Perhaps you think no man would return to me.
Yes.
I ache with it.
What business?
<u>What</u>? Oh no! Better it was me. There isn't another good tomato within a hundred leagues.
You will follow me.
That I promise you.
I knew you would not be. That's why I chose you.
Hand over your dinner.
They do not exist, except in the waters of the Swamp, where they will remain.
What kind of friend do you think I am?
Those beasts cannot be saddled by mortal men.
At the gallop!
Subject to the King, no doubt.
I intend to keep you alive, your majesty. So you can abdicate your throne and become my Warlord.
Colwyn, don't be a fool. You can't do battle with that thing.
No.
I ...  ... am Titch.
It's right behind you.
Many villagers are hiding in the forest. They need food.
Oh, my poor stomach.
The greatest boon of your otherwise worthless life, blockhead, is the privilege of dining on boar roasted by the hand of Ergo the Magnificent.
The forest is not safe these days. You'd best travel with us.
And who is <u>he</u> that they should join <u>him</u>?
No. He will master the leader.
You know nothing of power, you foolish girl. You think power is a mighty sword, or a strong castle, or the paltry magic of an Emerald Seer. Power is none of these.
Barak is still strong in the north, and Tendo holds the high passes. But the great desert forts have fallen.
Yes. You have left your place in the Needle. It is the time, then.
No. They are sad, solitary creatures, rarely seen.
It's a hundred leagues from here.
It is too late. He has drunk.
That is true.
Could not. Could not betray the girl to whom I was betrothed.
You said nothing. You told me nothing.
Where is he? My son.
Power you have given me. What can my power give you?
You cannot stop time. Go now, before it runs out.
Why do you want to know?
Asshole. But she won't miss anything, that. You'll see.
...What?
Dirty work, and I kill no women and no kids.
Do you need money?
Pay attention to women, Leon.  They are dangerous, you know?
What if you can't approach the car or he changes car?
OK.
Yes.
I never rent my gear.
Mathilda, stop, please!
Of course, so kiss me quickly, or they'll notice us.
What?
...17.
What shall we do?
...Later.
Yeah... There's a lot on TV.
You've just to love me and I'll be the happiest woman around.
...Mathilda, I don't feel like talking about this.
Then? You didn't give a shit about her father, didn't you?  You met anyway?
...Yes. The day he got out of jail. I allowed him to make ten steps... No more. And bang. Two hundred meters. By telescope. That night, I left my country and came here, to join my father, who worked for Tony.  ...I was 17. Then, I never left the city...  And never had another girlfriend...
Good! Snipers can't be in position.
It's not me, it's dark here... and I can't find the switch.
I have no fear.
Fine...
Can I sit on the stairways now?
Messina.
Giancarlo... Rinaldi.
I respect your business, Mister Tony. Every time we asked your help, we were very happy with the result.  It's right this that makes me nervous, now.  I hope you'll excuse my temporary bad mood?
Why am I such an authority?
I have new dreams now.
Maybe one day -- after you've been married twenty years you'll understand.
I have to walk -- by myself -- all the way -- every inch.
What?
Sergeant, I'm a psychologist and I know the difference between normal whims people have and actions that clearly display psychological problems... My uncle lost his wife and it devastated him.
Thank you.
No, I just don't want anybody dying because I didn't say something when I had the chance.
It's hard to say.  It's a delicate surgery.  There's no getting around the fact that it's a very high-risk situation.
No.  How far in one attempt -- what's the farthest someone like myself could walk?
There was no card.
It's just a regular day.
I don't follow.
When I was ten, my family lived in Pacifica for a year.  I used to go to the beach everyday that summer. I never felt so happy, carefree. It was a magic place for me... That's where my heaven will be.
Yes.
Go to sleep Ellen.
Pacifica, California.
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
Maurice and Ellen Parker... it was issued in Philly... Mr. Maurice Parker has come a long way from home.  Why?
That's all right isn't it?
Is that right?
That's me.
What was that?
Umm, no.  It's just that --
Never have children.  If they're not a burden to you, they're a burden to someone else.
California.
Tomorrow.
Walking where?
You were right.  From the heart is always better.
I was thinking you could open another store with investors.  I'm sure a lot of people would want to get involved with you now.
Saluting.
I do.
Don't do this.
No more words.  Until I touch the ocean with my hands... it's all just words.
I need your help.
Someone should be with you.
Hello.
What?  Who are you?
It's yours.
What are my choices?
No alcohol?
What do you think I should get?
No.
Water.
Right, I'll get your door. I tend to fade in and out lately.
Of course.
A shot of tequila, if you can spare it.
Yes... that should do it. What am I? A luxury?
Are you serious.
Of course. Wow... you look extremely beautiful.
Is that really what you want to ask me?
What are you thinking? Are you angry with me?
I'm going to move to a smart hotel, tomorrow if it'll make you feel better.  Let's talk about tomorrow. Wanna do something?
Three nights, two days. When is your rent coming up at the motel?
So! Let's dispense with the formalities. I want you here... now!
Don't be silly?
I do. I really do.  OK. I have to do some shopping alone. You go out for a few drinks and then pick up your things. Don't hurry and I'll be back before you to let you in.
Seriously, Ben... I need to keep pretty low-key around here. Maybe next time you could nap this side of the door. That was the landlord.
Sorry.
I know that...
Then come.  I'm going to change. Watch TV. I'll be half an hour.
Well, then... I hope we don't run into any tonight.
That's amazing. What are you? Some sort of angel visiting me from one of my drunk fantasies? How can you be so good?
Can we just forget it?
They wouldn't know.
You be careful to. I'm going to miss you.
Last spring I happened to walk past a house that I had once patronized. There was a cool breeze blowing off the ocean and through the window I could see a bare leg. The girl must have been taking a break between customers. It was a strange moment for me because it reminded me of my mother and despite the fact that I was late for something already I just stayed there, loving the atmosphere of it and my memory and... the reason I'm telling you this epilogue is that I felt that I'd come full circle.
I didn't know I'd ever need it again.
Yes.
Suits. I didn't tell them anything. You know anything about gears?
Right here at the hotel. Why?
I am lonely, Yuri.
Yes, of course. How much do you need?
It was a slow night. I went to a hotel for a few drinks.
I have a 4.0.
Insurance? A love affair? Pure unadulterated hatred? Believe me, the DA will come up with plenty of reasons.
Go to hell.
Who could better understand than me?
I believe you! Don't worry.
Was there any evidence that Mrs. Windham shot him?
Not that I saw. But like I said, I went straight upstairs to take a shower.
I got up, went to Starbucks, went to the gym, got a perm, and came home.
Yes.
Tell him, Paulette.
That's touching, Elle, but we need an alibi.
Thank you!
You're a beautiful girl, Elle.
Yes, I am.
Aristotle.
Would you be willing to stake your life on it?
What'd you do?
I couldn't help it! It was the most fun I've had since I've been in law school. Not only was I good enough for Warner -- I was better than him. He has to see serious I am now. Even Donovan was impressed, and he's a total hard-ass.
Name?
You know her?
Too bad you and I are the only ones.
I know. He has it sent out.
Yes, you are.
Power yoga?
What?!
No way --
Margot!
Did she do that to you, too?
Wow. I'm glad I met you.
My money's on the angry daughter or the ex-wife.
She's completely untrustworthy.
And D) Brooke is obviously hiding something.
Blondes are discriminated against worldwide! Brooke's a blonde, and people are saying she's sleeping with the cheesy pool boy and shooting her husband. If she was a mousy brunette, it would be, "Oh, the poor widow."
Fine. Sorry I brought it up.
Going back to LA. Maybe I can fulfill my destiny as a useless bimbo and join the Swedish Bikini Team. No more navy blue suits. No more panty- hose. No more trying to be something I'm not.
Oh, my God!!
Oh, my God! I completely forgot to tell you!
You should. Do you have a resume?
And engraved... Gives it that extra little something, doesn't it?  See you tomorrow!
Your what?
My family expects a lot from me. And I expect a lot from me. I plan on running for office some day.
That's why I think it's time for us to --
How can it be the right thing if we're not together?
So you're breaking up with me because you're afraid your family won't like me?  Everybody likes me!
No, silly. I go here.
But what? We took the same LSAT, we take the same classes --
How was I supposed to know what kind of shoes you had on?
Yes.
A restaurant in Oakland. Where no one would recognize us.
Well, that's what we're trying to prove didn't happen. Do you have any reason to believe it did?
Where's the Rock?
It's not a Theta --
Always.
This is another victory, my friends. What began with the lash shall be concluded with a caress.
To finish last evening's delightful work.
Grotesque... monstrous...
We're all of us beasts, my dear. Only most are afraid to show it.
I know no more of shame than I do of fear.  I wear this mask not for concealment but protection.
Too bad your precious Jack can't hear you... the damsel in distress... A rescue attempt would be most amusing... We could flay sweet Jack alive as an after-dinner entertainment...
Kill me... I want... so nice...
I see...
Do as you wish with my body, you'll never possess my soul!
It's nothing.  My men take great delight in routing the enemy.  Don't trouble yourself, beauty.
Or looked so beautiful...
So you shall be... Like our brothers, the hawk and the wolf, our spirits know no master... we are created in the pure image of the savage God that set our turbulent universe in motion.
Cathay?
No more listening!  Your time is at an end, insignificant whelp!
Or was it the time you and Jimmy Squarefoot stole the golden apples I'd forged.
A riddle without an answer is but an empty cup when you're thirsty for wine.
I fear she's lost.
Big question that, lad.  Why what?
Don't you care about what's happened?
Will you lead me to her?
And if she thinks me a liar?
Bravely spoke.  You've the heart of a champion, true enough.
No false modesty, lad.  You're a proper champion.  Achilles' armor sits on you like it was forged to fit.
Screwball!  You dolt!  I've a mind to change you into a toad.
Careful, lad.
Save your mischief for the Black Baron.
A true and troubling question, Gump... We'll start from where the unicorn was killed.  The Baron must have left a trail.
What know you of fields of war?
That would be Devil's Needle.  Last landmark I know in these woods.
Nay, Jack, tis not what you're thinking.
Dwarves be very sensitive about their feet.
Very secretive, they are.  Keep their feet covered up.  Best if you don't mention it.
No, thank the Lord, but she be sore envenomed by the spider's bite.
We'll trust in faith, Gump.
Once you thought we'd never find the Greek's armor and look at ye now, decked out like a proper hero.
It's your own fear troubles you... We're here, aren't we?  For all the dark magic protecting it.
We'll need more siege machinery and longer scaling ladders.
Defend ourselves.  We've bested far worse already.
Never mind.  Just do it!  Retrieve the arrows somehow.
And frog don't fly and bite like tomcats.  It be magic, Jack... powerful ogre's magic.
Been telling you that all along, lad.
It's what we'll find there worries me.
I don't... understand.
Tis a delicate operation, lad. Requires a bit of engineering... Next!
Never show mercy!
Sapphire!
I've not heard a note out of you.
Were the Princess Lili to join me I would sing till my lungs burst!
I'll try.
Hush up, Screwball.  Do your own worm-sticking if you like the taste so well.
No, no, no... this is different!
Three cheers for our champion.
You'll do it because I am you liege and I command you to do it!
Oh, Jack, you are a wild man to use me so.
Blackheart.  Aptly named.
What's the matter?
Your command is my wish, Princess Lili.
Are you honest?
I don't know.  They've hurt the unicorn.
My own father...
Oh, yes, and the mare with him.
A maid must beware of flattery... Methinks you want to kiss me.
Only what's right...
No... it's not you he's afraid of, it's... light...
Sunlight... It destroys him.
And I... love you...
Nor can I.  Damn!  It's buzzing all around me.  Ouch!  I can hear it like a fly trapped inside my ear... Says its name is Oona!
Thought the weather terrible of late.
I bring you the only treasure worthy of your loveliness... for naught else in the universe rivals the reflected glory of your beauty.
They call me Green Jack, ma'am.
A unicorn's been slain.  The last stallion in all the country.
That would be the Baron's way. There'll be no light or life in the world until the alicorn is taken from him and he vanquished.
Follow the raven in her flight, Follow old black wing to the edge of night...
Is she fair, this princess?
You'll visit again?
I'm partial to oaks, as are all faerie folk.  Mayn't I come visit sometime?
Fie!  Don't speak of charms.  I should charm you for being so dull- witted.
Do I not please you, Jack?
What shape I take matters not.  Long you for another?  I'll give you your heart's desire.
Why should I feel such pain?  Should be the other way round... I could vex you... make you dance your life away...
And as barren of love as stone.
I think she's about to foal.
Done like a champion.  Can you reach me with the line?
Oh, but I have.
Yes, yes... Jimmy Squarefoot good friend to one and all...
The Black Baron, you say?
Much good we do the world, for all our noble quest...
He was there and then he wasn't!
We can work.
I would have anyway.
I love red!  That's my favorite color!
I'd be more comfortable if you hadn't slept with Josh.  And George would be more comfortable if he weren't dying.
No.
Marilyn Manson...and I guess he's into guys.  I hate nose rings.  And the blue eye shadow thing really isn't working.
Is that legal?
I'm not shaving my legs or pits this summer, I've decided.
I want you to try something with me, okay?
Hi.
Well, if you don't go, I guess I'll see you.
Come over to my house whenever you want. I'll tell my mom.
I can use your mom's.
I don't want you to!
I don't even...what do you mean?  I don't even know what that means.
Does everything have to have a point?
It would help me if I could kiss you.
Okay.  I guess.
If my kids and my wife were always at an ex-husband's house, I'd worry.
Will he talk to me?
He wants the entire roof taken off and lowered.
It's thirty feet.
Months.
I did tell you, didn't I?  That I'd be ready to start the Berlin model today?
That's too long.
How old are you?
I hate this job.
For everything.
Good.  I was hoping for that.
Uh huh.
It's midnight.  What's the matter, Sam?
The plumber's due out on Friday.
My life is a warning.  I just can't figure out for what.
Why would you be there?
You live in Cory's parents' cabin?
If you hit me, I'll call the police.
You're so predictable.
I'd blame you.  I want you here.
A friend of yours is here.
Sit down for a second.
My dad used to play a game.  I never really understood what it was until after he was gone.
The game was to make me smaller than he was.  No matter what.  He could be almost invisible as a human being, but I had to be smaller.  So if I got good grades, I was a pussy for not playing football.  If I cut my hair for him, it wasn't short enough.  If I shaved it, I looked like a psycho.  I never won the game.  Not once. And if he couldn't make me smaller with words...
I won't ever hit you.  I don't want you smaller.  I want you to be happy.  You're not.  Not here with me. Not home with your mother.  Not up in Tahoe.  Not alone.  Not anywhere.  You're what I was most of my life, Sam. I see it in your eyes.  In your sleep. In your answer to everything.  You're barely alive.
I know.  Why?
Nothing.
I'm telling you now.
I haven't used anything for two days. I'm trying.
The kind where there isn't really an answer.
I wanted you here so we could have a few months together.  Maybe everything happens for a reason.  Something bad to force something good.
Yes.
You lied to me!
Good for you.
You know what mortise and tenon is?
Stage four pancreatic cancer.  They haven't even pretended to offer treatment.  You tell me, when would you start eating red meat?
We just weren't very much alike, I guess. I don't know.  I liked your dad more than I liked you.
Thanks for telling me.
He doesn't answer.
You're the most beautiful woman I have ever known in my life.
What did you do with your dog?
You've been saying that for twenty years. While we were dating, you said it.
I want him with me.
I'm married.
Well, for later then.
Which?
What have you been before today?
I'm fine.  Nothing.  I'll drop by your lunch tomorrow.
That wasn't a dream.  That was Sam.
My tongue around the edge of his ear is what cured him.
Or wound.  Let them keep their eyes and fingers.
This was my very first slow dance.
I'd rather you not be here.
I can hire workers to help me.
That was the truth.
I can't pick you up.
No.  Mostly me.
Left you?
No.
Does Alyssa know?
The payoff.
Sooner than the Fall.
Lois will stay with them.  Or we can pawn them off on your parents.
Good.  That was the plan.  We couldn't stand him and George needed help.
I know.
Sam took them to a movie.
If I walk out the door, who's gonna be here tonight for the follow through?
Why?
Okay.
Yeah.
Then maybe this isn't what he wants, but this what he was hoping for.  Maybe it's what I want.
I just thought it would be nice.
Yes, it is.
And the baby?
Cost you a pair of nylons.
I did, Claude. I mentioned you. I mentioned you both. But the fact is, pardons don't come cheap. The kid can hit. What can you do?
Then what's the problem?
Well, alright then. What do you think about this new tie?
Yes, sir.
He don't sound like he's from 'round here.
Claude. Here's to your new job down at the bank. I always knew you'd make something of yourself.
I was hoping you were gonna say an engagement ring, Claude.
That's what respectable folks do. Get a job, get married, start having babies. That's what you want, isn't it?
He seemed like a pretty good lawyer to me. His offices take up an entire floor of that big, new building on 125th Street, and he was using all these words I never heard before. He even offered me a job.
I know it begins with a "C"...
Why would you want to go home? It's so early.
Probably to Spanky's headquarters down at the pier.
You? Dine and ditch, right?  Over ten bucks?  You're probably looking at a thumb.
Damn straight, it is. I got my own set of keys because I'm supposed to open up. So if I ain't there 8 a.m. Monday morning, there's gonna be hell to pay.
I don't know. Bank teller. Sounds like ladies work to me.
You gave up baseball to be a bank teller? I can't latch on to that.
You're talking about giving up baseball to be a bank teller.
You need collateral.
What gave you that idea?
Don't get all agitated on me. I bought a bottle of rum from a couple of dudes, I heard 'em talking...
Still got that ten dollars?
We've still got 36 cases of rum. That's better than money.
It ain't here.
My daddy's watch. This is the dude I was telling you about --
Life?! What's life mean? There's no way I can do life. I got a job starts Monday morning!
He does it all by himself.
What about you, Radio?
Pack of lies. Don't listen to him. We didn't kill nobody. We were railroaded. And we gonna prove that.
Wait up there, Claude. You give that guy your corn bread and the next thing you know you'll be ironing his shirts and clipping his toenails.
What do you know about boats? I bet you can't even swim.
Cut the bullshit. What do you want, Claude?
Yeah.
Well, let's just think about that for a moment. He's a successful lawyer up in New York City and you're down here with a bright future in the cotton picking business. Eeny, meeny, miney, Maynard.
I said you're soft.
Absolutely. The map is very clear.
The hell you talking about? What train?
Sure, it says Allie Reynolds right here in the program. He's warming up right now. Man, we're so close to the field I need cleats. How'd you get such good seats?
They must be the right people. Whoa, there goes the hot dog man. Let's get a couple. Damn, that smells good. Nothing like a ballpark hot dog, huh?
All right, grab the bat. Let's see what you can do.
Whatever.
I'm not gonna let it go. The man needs to explain himself. Makin' promises.
I'm not in the mood right now, Ray.
They're called pilots! I'm serious, Ray. I'm not in the mood for one of your stupid, fucked-up plans right now.
Here's a news flash, Ray. We never were friends. We've just been stuck together for 12 years. It's been nothing but bad luck since the moment I ran into you. Every time I look at you I get sick to my stomach thinking about what my life could have been if I'd never bumped into Ray Gibson.
Excuse me? Are you talking to me?
We're not talking, you're talking, and doing too damn much of it, if you ask me.
You sure looked funny running for those pies, bullets flying all around you.
You ain't getting out of that trunk.
And what will we do when we get there? I'm sixty-five years old, Ray. So are you. What are we gonna do out here? Get married, have kids, settle down? That boat sailed without us, man.
Some faces you just don't forget. Warren Pike's is one of 'em.
That's because you're soft. Gimme the gun.
Well, Ruth shoulda built it a little better. Damn thing's falling to pieces. Gonna hurt somebody.
Shh! Is that so hard to believe?
Never thought I'd hear Ray Gibson say that. Hell with you then. You'd only slow me down anyway.
Creamed chip beef on toast. Except we're outta beef, so I had to improvise.
You killed Santa Claus?
That's right. We don't need no fences, we have the gun line. It runs from shack to shack clear around the yard. You are now inside the gun line...
Hell, no! I just got something in my eye.
I think that old man lost his marbles about a hundred years ago. Come on, let's get this over with.
Rayford!
Don't cry, mama. This place ain't so bad as it looks. Sure, we work hard, but there's plenty fresh air and sunshine... And you know something else, I've taken to going to church regular. They got services every Sunday right there in the mess hall.
Don't argue with me. You need it more than I do. I know how a little money can help in a place like this.
I gave you life. And they can't take it away from you. Remember that. You'll get outta here someday. I believe that. You gotta believe it, too.
Hey, where's Claude? I don't see Claude!
He must still be in there.
It'll be too late.
If somebody deserves respect, Mr. Pike, they receive it from me, convict or no convict.
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to teach this uppity nigger a lesson in manners.
They're called subways. A nickel will take you from one end of Manhattan to the other. Helluva ride, too.
They'll be sending you up there soon enough. And not just for a visit, neither.
You found him.
But you do. What does that say about you, Ray? What does that say about me? I've given you a lot of leeway over the years on account of your father. But he didn't last long enough to teach you the meaning of the word respect so I guess I'm gonna have to school you myself.
Comes up the Mississippi. I can get more. A lot more. I was thinking about going into business for myself, but under the circumstances, I'd be willing to take on a partner.
Well maybe you should go back and talk it over with him.
No. It's the inner light. And with it we can defeat anything you've got.
Absolutely not.
I've been waiting on this day for ten thousand years.
Yeah, get out of here! Beat it!
What do you think about... Earth?
Well, we must get people sinning if we want to fill up our New Hell. How are things going down at City Hall?
All right. Let me out.
Don't do it!
Well, she was about six-three, only spoke Portuguese and had really long grey hair.
Well tell her I said "hi" back.
We can see what's going on anywhere on Earth. Look.
Yeah, you do...
You're already there...
Trying to capture his brother in a flask and preserve the balance of good and evil on Earth.
He'll be here. Just keep your cool, kid.
Put it in your mouth.
Got ya.  Is it okay if I do the sleep thing?
Nobody's as evil as my brothers. Those dudes put the wick in wicked.
This is bullshit, man.  I'm gonna win the Superbowl this year, with or without you!
The important thing for the stability of our rule is to maintain the balance between good and evil. And I don't think any of you are ready for that responsibility yet. You need the wisdom that comes only with the passage of time.
Well, I thought that after messing with your head, I'd give you a little kick in the keester.
Metallica, Dad. Come on.
So go get 'em, Dad!
What are you gonna do? Look at me, Nicky! I got no legs, I got no hips, I got one ear...
I can't hear you, Nicky. I can't hear anything!
Could you maybe not tell anyone about this?
You got it.
It's Stanley, sir.
That's nice, Grandpa. Why don't you just enjoy the fishing?
Mr. Sleepyhead must have some major ties to the dark side.
We know where to find Nicky.
Can't Beefy use his penis powers to get us out of this?
Not again, fellas. It kind of hurts.
Oh, that's terrible, Reege...
You followed him?
All right...
Oh. Sorry, Andrew. Valerie?
My dad's an optometrist.
School?
What was that?
What are you doing?
Why would you be floating?
...to decompose. And I love my Dad very much. So I came to Earth to save him but then crazy eyes stole my flask and I met you and... well, my dog tells me I just might be in love with you.
East Rutherford.
I've always wanted to kill someone. Can I do it?
I cut up a Sandman yesterday. They said I'd never get him... but I cut him up good, I did.
All right -- what are you?
Where do we go?!  Where do we go from here??!!
Do you know how long all this will last? Not thirty years... or thirty thousand years... but thirty thousand years... and you'll be part of it. Ages will roll... Ages. And you'll be here... the two of you... eternally frozen... frozen... beautiful.
Regular storage procedure... the same as the other food... The other food stopped coming and they started.
Well, why not!? That's exactly how everything works. How else could the city stay in balance -- You have a better idea?
Well the minute you get a better idea you can stop wondering.  You know, Logan -- you wonder a lot. Too much for a Sandman.
I never even visited Nursery before tonight.  When you wonder, it slows you up -- you know?
Well... you can't have them all.
Come on. I don't want to miss the filing-in. There'll be some I know tonight, I think...
Only a few? You're just not trying.
I'm in my party mood.
It has nothing to do with you.
Holly. Holly! Please... The other Sandman. Remember the one who came after --
Nothing. I felt sad, I put myself on the circuit. It was a mistake.
He was killed.
Jessica.
I thought I had to do something.
Curious.
How a Sandman lives.
Why is it wrong to run?
I suppose. But what if you want to live?
K.
Thanks... but I have the choice.
Then it's still no.
You know something.
Both... running's what I'm interested in.
A Runner gave it to me.
I let him go... believe me.
What do you need?
Of course --
We'll be all right...  We will...
I won't.
Thirty thousand years didn't last very long, did they?
The Lifeclocks have no power outside.
Of course.
He asked if we would bury him when his time comes.
Sanctuary is the right to live... nothing more. But nothing less, either...
It's part of the hydrogalvanic system. The ocean tides are changed into energy somehow.
Yes...
Where are you going?
A Sandman can get as sick of his face as anyone else. Where's the doctor?
It's all right with me. Is he here?
No -- Look, I'm in a hurry.
I have always been here...
No, no, no
Of course you can stay. This belongs to the people.
It doesn't matter who we are. Follow the tunnel to the end.
Where to? Hey, Lanie, I heard you were out of it for a while, too.
Sheila'll be at "Tops".
Texaco... What's wrong with that?
No, I'm okay.
This is our bedroom.
I forgot. Anyway, I hate the idea of acting paranoid.
Right... This just glided along.
Yeah.
Yeah... Laurent.
Yeah, I remember.
I have to go somewhere with Mr. Eddy.
Are you positive he knows?
No... A job... I didn't know what. He set up an appointment for me to see a man.
If you want me to go away, I'll go away.
Yeah. Call him.
Okay...
What about tonight?... Whatiya gonna do about Mr. Eddy tonight?
Alice?
Yes, I believe so.
He is? I didn't think you knew Dick. How do you know he's dead?
The night before you showed up in the slammer...
I gotta headache... What's goin' on?
You came home. Your friend Sheila brought you here.
Warden, it's not him. It was not Fred Madison in that cell.
I don't know. The guards say they've never seen him before.
I've got men searching the building and the grounds now.
We'll get a tail put on him.
I'm not entirely certain, Captain. You'll have to see for yourself.
Captain... this is some spooky shit we got here.
What about yesterday?
Pete, what happened to you?
DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY FUCKIN' CAR LENGTHS IT TAKES TO STOP A CAR AT 35 M.P.H.?
Tenor... Tenor saxophone. Do you...
No, no. I want to go in.
Aspirin... fly head. I gotta have more aspirin.
That dog woke me. I lay there for a while, then decided to get up.
Thanks, guys.
I wish I knew.
Just a minute.
He's got some fucked up friends.
How could I miss it? The TV won't quit with that stuff.
Do they aim for the head or for the heart?
No, it's nothin'... I'm all right.
No... Thank you!... I'll be bringin' the "Caddy" by tomorrow.
Pornos?
Okay.
I'm really glad you're doin' okay, Pete.
At your house. Don't you remember?
No... I really don't want to talk about it.
Thank you.
It's always been a source of deep regret, but the mountains surrounding us have made reception almost impossible.
Yes. Those are our own people. They never venture beyond the point where you were met this morning. It is much too hazardous.
Yes.
A paleontologist.
Uh-huh.
You see, from this vertebrae I shall be able to reconstruct the entire skeleton.
It was the vertebrae of a Megatherium - found in Asia.
Okay, brother.
I see.
Well, it's a good morning, anyway.
It's very strange, you know. You've never told us anything about yourself. Who are you, anyway? Why don't you take your mask off for once!
You are a thief, sir, and a swindler, and I, for one, will be only too glad to turn you over to the police when we get back.
Just call me Barney.
Okay, Lovey.
This doesn't obligate me in any way.
Plumbing. Everything modern. I'm going to run pipes all through the village-
Please! Please! Do not wait for me! I eat so very little.
All right.
No.
When are you going to start?
Oh, no - you don't want to go yet, honey.  She'll stick around too.  Is that right?
I'm glad you like it. It's made right here in the valley.
There are some things, my dear Conway, I deeply regret I may not discuss.
They were.
Centuries.
Oh, let me see - way back in 1713, I think it was, that Father Perrault stumbled into the Valley, half frozen to death. It was typical of the man that, one leg being frozen, and of course there being no doctors here, he amputated the leg himself.
Rather astonishingly so, yes. And particularly so in the case of Father Perrault himself. Do you know when he and the natives were finished building Shangri-La, he was 108 years old and still very active, in spite of only having one leg?
The only one.
Suppose she should leave it?
I can't let him go alone. It's suicide!
No doctors?  That's fine. That's just fine.
Don't preach that cheap, second- hand stuff to me!  Go on, beat it. Beat it!
Pardon me-
Are you so certain you are away from it?
Are you the High Lama?
Yes.
I'm going to drag him out and force him to tell us what his game is.
Thanks.  I suppose all this comes under the heading of adventure.
You talk as though you intend on staying.
What could there be except just another hill? In any event, I'm not curious. At the moment, it seems to me we should be concerned about getting home. I'd give anything to be in London right now.
Nothing about the porters yet?
Good heavens, Bob, we've been here two weeks and we haven't found out a thing.
George. George - do you mind? I'm sorry, but I can't talk about it tonight.
I don't see that there's anything to say.
You mustn't. You've got to stay here now.
So you think I'm mad?
So you think it's all nonsense, huh?
Is that all my story meant to you?
George, you couldn't possibly stay here, could you?
Why not?
What do you mean - "fade away like an echo"?
Yes, everything!
There's nothing that would suit them better than to lose us, but we must go on.  Come on.
Hiding? Oh, no. Hunting - I was in the interior - hunting fossils. This morning I looked up suddenly-
What's he doing? Where's he taking us? He may be a maniac for all we know.
Why, you - you- Look here - he may dash us to pieces!
Where are we going? Huh?
Well, Mr. Conway, for a man who is supposed to be a leader, your do- nothing attitude is very disappointing.
Oh, I know. It was full of this and full of that. But you were accomplishing nothing. You were going nowhere, and you knew it.
A little boy whistling in the dark!? Do you realize that there is a British cruiser waiting at Shanghai, smoke pouring out of its funnels, tugging at its moorings, waiting to take Mr. Conway back to London? Do you know that at this minute there are headlines shrieking all over the world the news that Conway is missing? Does that look like a man whose life is empty?
You're absolutely right. And I had to come all the way to a pigeon house in Shangri-La to find the only other person in the world who knew it. May I congratulate you?
I'll help you. To begin with, you'd like to know what I'm doing here. Whether I was born here.
Yes, I know.
I was just going to.
How could I know that a war was going to break out right over my head!  Right over my head. Oh, my word! I tell you, those Chinese were pouncing on me from every direction. I had to get into these ridiculous clothes in order to escape.
I tell you, we're going west, and Shanghai is east of here!
Well - no - I think I'd better wait. Yes, yes. I will. I'll wait.
Perhaps.
I gotta be honest about something.
I... I don't know, air.  This guy. Mr. "Best of the best of the best... " I don't know.  It's just still find it a little...  humorous.  I'm sorry.  Sir.
No. But You'll get used to it.    Welcome to the Men in Black.
Further... what are you talking about, air?  That makes no sense-- I hold three cadet class records--
Well this didn't.
Actually, sir--
All the time, sir.
Yes, air.  But I'm usually wrong. Sir.
Kay, I'm sorry...
Oh yeah?  The hell you weren't. Little pither just out of school...
So what's the problem?
This is a college?  I'm sorry, I thought it was a carnival.
Just so I understand... you're "thing" is... acting like an idiot?  Or is it actually being an idiot?  Besides--
I taught kindergarten.
Let's see... that was second gear..Kay shifts into THIRD.  Jay winces.
Something seem unusual to you about that?
And what's this ... ?
No. The aliens organized, all of them, and tried a coup. They made it seem like a radio show afterwards.
I dunno, man.  Maybe we should.
Kay.  All I'm saying--
I know you don't trust him.  You don't trust anybody--
For how long?
Actually... I don't know.
They respond to fear, right?
You figured what?
I dunno. One?
We've got about eight or nine prospects	I want you look--
Actually, yeah--
How'd you know that?  Kay?
They're not my pals--
Come again?
Seriously.  I'm not going any further until you tell who you are.
Fine.  Good.
Keep an eye on things there.  We'll see what we can find out at Ernie Goosels.
What do we have?  Are we showing anything?
They went right to the President.
Don't tell me.  Insects.
Well, uh... so we can got into things, I guess.
And I assume you're bringing this to us because we're the most powerful country on the planet...
Can you see the balloon man?
He'll turn around.
Anderton, leave.
What is it?
I can't leave.  You said so yourself, there is no Minority Report.  I don't have an alternative future.
Why?
What --
Found?  Where?
Anne Lively...
I know... I do, too...
Yes, you did.
And put them out.  Some not as quickly as others, but let's change the subject, shall we?  The future is much more interesting than the past.  Don't you think?
The nano... what?
Drowning.
This is the official composite of the three precogs?
... Graveyard shift.
Try again.
So she cleaned up.  Where is she now?
Hang on, Lamar --
We won't let them.
And who the hell is that?
Then come to my house.  We'll talk --
Everybody runs.
Send a DCPD blue & white out there, set up a perimeter and tell 'em we're en route.  What's our confirmed time?
No maglev system.
Yeah?  So?
Did he close the front door?
Start a location run and a contact search for future victim Leo Crow.  And, Jad, I'll need a Last Known Sheet when you get it.
That was easy.
They did.  Make yourself comfortable.  We'll be back in an hour.
Speaking of interfacing, I'd love to say hello.
We keep a strict separation so that no one can accuse us of tampering.
Why don't you cut the cute act, Danny, and tell me exactly what it is you're looking for?
I need help with her.
That's right.
So?
They don't belong to anybody.
That's great.
Are you kidding?  There's absolutely positively no way, on my best day, I could ever beat twelve seconds!
No.  He got tired of pretending.
He's alive?
I'm asking you again, who made you do this?
If I tell you, my family gets nothing.
You're not gonna kill me...
The what?
I'm not.  I was trying to heal them, not turn them into... something else.
So you won't help me?
Obviously, for Precrime to function, there can't be any suggestion of fallibility.  After all, what good is a Justice system that instills doubt?  It may be reasonable, but it's still doubt.
Inside the Precog who predicted it.  All you have to do is download it.
If... you have one.
Nothing.  I didn't kill him.
We know why John was tagged.
Sean --
I'll be right there.
He's my subordinate!
Where are you?
Wait, just a second...
How?
We teach the tech's to identify them and disregard...
Yes.
Shhh.  You know what I hear?
Nice to meet you.  Gum?
Knott!
I'd love to, but I've got an open house today at the Ressler place.
I know who you are.
Yes.
I don't have any cream.  Sorry.
So you haven't seen his apartment?
Have you been there recently?
But John was with him at the pool?
It wasn't a suicide attempt.  I regret ever saying that.
I left him because every time I looked at him, I saw my son.  Every time I got close to him, I smelled my little boy.  That's why I left him.  And now you can leave.
I haven't seen him in two years.
Shhh!  They're sleeping.
What does he want with a precog?
Do me a favor, Arthur, keep him on til I see what's happening.
Good afternoon, Bobby. I'll let Max know you're here.
No thank you.
When served warm --
We have snifters
Is it a good room?
Just tell me. Wait, here... Do you have change of a hundred?
Yeah. Take it.
So?
Nightlife. Where's the hot ass?
We're in Fashion.
He's okay.
He's alright.
But maybe that's okay. Maybe that's just what you need.
Mommy works hard so you can have all your pretty clothes. Don't you like your pretty clothes?
You gonna bust my horns, or you want spaghetti
I love you. Come home.
The easy kind. They're young and rich and well mannered.
A draw. What makes you think they're well mannered?
I don't like you working with Wendy. Why are you working with Wendy?
You shouldn't. He likes you.
Maybe if you didn't go Rambo every time I did a lapdance, you'd still be doing it yourself. Meantime, I gotta feed my little girl.
How could you let her see this?
Tell you the truth, I don't give a shit for me. But that little girl is so special, and you're gonna fuck her up.
I had a fight up at Sportsman's.
Draw.
She'll be out in a minute.
To be honest, man, I don't know shit either. All I know is it ain't drugs and it ain't now.
It's bad. Before you even showed up, he said you were Maxie's 'token goons', and not to be trusted. He wanted to TCB alone. I was gonna ride shotgun to keep the English dude above board. Now he's spooked. This shit's snowballing.
This one?
They were out of line --
So, that's it. I'm out?
I don't want to drive another girl, Max. The only reason I'm --
No.
Yeah.
I hate to ruin your fairy tale, but I've been paying Jess' rent for six months. She's got to keep dancing --
What drill?
Good morning.
Hi. I'm Jimmy.
Yeah. You're staying at the Soho Grand. You got anything checked?
Traveling light. I like that.
Yeah.
Excuse me, we need to make a call.
Yeah, I'm 5-5 and 1.
It's not losing record.
I'll page you.
Yeah. I know the number.
I thought you hate that club.
You don't imply about something like that. You lay it out on the table. Besides, I'm not taking the job.
Sorry coach.
Fuck him.
She wants you to paint the ashtray.
This paint sucks. The white shows through.
Nah, don't bother --
How much? Okay. Make it fifteen minutes and you can add on a ten dollar tip. Bye.
What are you doing?
His names Horrace. Horrace, this is Ricky Slade.
I don't know.
Like I said, I don't know.
So we're working?
You too?
Fine.
We're getting whacked.
Why else you think he won't tell us where the sit down is?
You want us strapped, don't you?
I'm tired and I'm scared, and I'm not looking at fucking penguins.
You wouldn't even know where to get one.
You couldn't even get a hand job from bridge and tunnel posse, how you gonna get a gun?
Why?
I did! I paid for half the fuckin drinks!
Don't fuck around. You're gonna get us all killed.
Easy...
Tom. How's it going?
Bobby and Ricky.
That's a good idea, maybe I will!
I'm just warning you, I can't swim.
S'up.
A little.
Yeah, sure. How much are they?
Yes.
He spoke to me. You want me to dis him?
Why? What I say bad?
What? Why am I bad?
You really in trouble?
No, man, that's fine. Just put that you took delivery.
I handle most of Cardiff Giant's stuff.
And the money. Where do we bring the money?
So tell me how it is.
But, Max --
So, you must be the Red Dragon.
Who's up for a night on the town.
Red, and I ain't no punk.
Heard where?
My papa taught me one thing: don't never bullshit a West Indian bullshit artist.
Let 'em come. I'm ready.
I'm there, daddy. Wheww. I'm cool enough to kill.
You din't have no 1, 2, 8.
You know it.
That's a fact. What you do, boy?
Put it in a cup of water. It's nutmeg.
You need something. It's not a reefer, but it'll help some.
I can show you how to get out of prison. And it's no hype.
Go on, fool; the marble shooters are waiting for you.
Look 'em up and and out what they mean.
The first men on earth were black. They ruled and there was not one white face anywhere. But they teach us that we lived in caves and swung from trees. Black men were never like that.
A black man playing big league ball is something.
No. That's the name of the slave- master who owned your family. You don't even know who you are. You're nothing. Less than nothing. A zero. Who are you?
-- the hardest and the greatest.
-- the hardest and the greatest.
I'm sure we can. This is a new sister, Sister Betty.
Not exactly, but I want to be one, like you.
All praises are due to Allah. Thank you, Brother Minister.
Let me explain. No. I'll do better than that. I'll show it to you. Scientifically. But it's demonstration purely in the interest of science, you understand?
I can handle it.
Yes I did. Did you hear my answer?
You're with me even when you're away.
The talk is everywhere!
There are always slanders, always lies. You're reading the devil's lies. Can't you see they're trying to bring us down, bring down the Messenger.
I'm not interested in personal publicity. Our people know what I'm doing.
What do you want me to do? Our people need me.
What do you want me to do?
Don't answer the phone. It's all right. It's all right. Nothing is gonna happen to anybody.
Let some of us come down there.
I wish you'd listen to us. What about the meeting tomorrow? We need to frisk people.
What did I tell you about assuming?
The way I feel, I ought not to go out there today. In fact, I'm going to ease some of this tension by telling the black man not to fight himself -- that's all a part of the white man's big maneuver, to keep us fighting amongst ourselves, against each other. I'm not fighting anyone, that's not what we're here for.
Preacher, take your tin Jesus and the Virgin Mary, both, and shove 'em.
I'm not saying anything, preacher. I'm proving to you that God is black.
Entirely.
Thank you. Now the Negro in the field caught hell all day long. He was beaten by the master; he lived in a shack, wore castoff clothes and hated his master. If the house caught fire, he'd pray for a wind. If the master got sick, he'd pray that he'd die. And if you said to him, "Let's go, let's separate", he'd yell, "Yeah, man, any place is better than this." You've got a lot of Field Negroes in America today. I'm one.
Do your job, Get me a bourbon on the rocks and a pack of Lucky's.
With him?
I ain't stupid.
What for? I ain't white and I don't put out.
Murder.
500.
No. You'll be marked for death.
...That isn't a whore?
Shhhh! I don't like women that talk.
Well, all reet, then.
Eat lead, coppers.
You're too small to be Bogart.
Yeah.
So what about him?
Am I a suspect?
[It's a permit to carry a gun in Columbia. The gun you're about to find in that suitcase.]
I guess that makes you the smart one.
It's a little late.
He lives in a Judicial Compound. He travels by motorcade. He has better protection than George Bush. Even more importantly he is part of La Hermanidad. His reach is far and wide.
Where?
[Daniel what?]
[Who are you?]
[Me, too. Tell me about the guardians.]
I don't know, but I know his face.
[In the next hour, where do I find your partner?]
[Listen! I will give you a life for a life.]
[Lucky how?]
[You stole the drop.]
[The ransom was ten.]
It's loaded.
My coordination. Reaction time. If top professionals try to kidnap your daughter, the service will be on par with the pay.
Creasy??? Where the fuck are you?
Listen it was a calculated risk. I've done it a million times and never got caught.
It doesn't make sense to x-ray your bags coming off the plane.
Everything happens once if you live long enough.
I came to visit you.
Oh, now you think I can be trusted.
Maybe...
I'll get you up to the border. Friend of mine'll take you in to San Diego. Drop you right at the hospital.
Ein Klines Bisschen. [A tiny bit.]
Creasy. Just call me Creasy.
You can drive and talk at the same time, can't you?
That's right.
No.
Once I get in the water but not starting off. By the time I catch up, it's too late.
You need to practice.
It must be difficult having lots of wives.
Yes.
Your father has business.
That's not a question.
Still not a question.
You should break all my fingers, Creasy, then tape them back together. I won't be able to play the piano, but I could still swim.
No.
You're paying me to protect her, not amuse her. Right?
I want you to get into your car now and meet me on the south end of the footbridge between Reforma and the freeway junction. In 45 minutes.
What was her name?
I know! I just had to let one go because I couldn't afford him!
Her beauty fucks with your mind.
[No. Why?]
You do?
[It's a moral issue. On one hand you're cleaning up the bad guys, but in another way we are feeding the problem that produces bad guys.]
I plan to. I'll even help him if I can. He's going to lead me to the 'The Dreamer'. Someone I want very badly. But I'd like to understand him. Give me that.
You told me that she was a little tall, but that she wasn't bad looking at all.
Listen. You people go grab a table. I'll be back inna minute. I'll be right back.
Oh, yeah.
Angie, I'm thirty-four years old. I been looking for a girl every Saturday night of my life. I'm tired of looking. Everybody's always telling me to get married. Get married. Get married. Don't you think I wanna get married? I wanna get married. They drive me crazy. Now, I don't wanna wreck your Saturday night for you, Angie. You wanna go somewhere, you go ahead. I don't wanna go.
I looked for you, Angie, before I cut out, but I couldn't find you.
Oh, I couldn't eat nothing. My mother just stuffed me right up to the jaws.
I don't feel like going, Angie. I thought I'd take this girl to a movie.
He was here last night till about two o'clock. I hear you really got stuck with a dog last night.
Angie. He says she was a real scrawny- looking thing.
I been getting a pain in my shoulder.
It's her baby too, you know.
What happen?
I keep one eye open when I sleep, because she's gonna come in, stab me in my bed.
Oh, Catherine, please! Don't make a tragedy. You come to my house where you know you be happier yourself.
Were the lights on?
They're the worst. College girls are one step from the streets. They smoke like men inna saloon. My son Joseph, his wife, you know, she types onna typewriter. One step from the streets, I tell you. Mrs. Pilletti ponders this philosophy for a moment.
Catherine, you are a blanket of gloom. Wherever you are, the rain follows. Someday, you gonna smile, and we gonna declare a holiday.
I really should get home...
Oh, I'm fine.
I like you. I like you. I been telling you all night, I like you...
Please...
Nothing.
How do you do?
Okay.
No, Mrs. Pilletti. We were just going home. Thank you very much anyway.
It's a very sad business, I tell you. A woman, fifty-six years old, all her life, she had her own home. Now she's just an old lady, sleeping on her daughter-in-law's couch. It's a curse to be a mother, I tell you. Your children grow up and then what is left for you to do? What is a mother's life but her children? It is a very cruel thing when your son has no place for you in his home.
I came up to dance, wadda you think? You here with somebody?
That's the one.
About eight o'clock.
I don't know, Ma. I'm all knocked out. I may just hang arounna house.
I say, why don't you go to the Stardust Ballroom? It's loaded with tomatoes.
Put on your blue suit...
You not ugly.
Marty...
She's twenty-nine, Ma.
She didn't look Italian to me.
Hey, Ang'...
Hey, Louise, I want you to meet Marty Pilletti. Marty, that's Louise Kelly, inna back seat there.
Get ridda her. This is money inna bank.
That's right, Missus Fusari. It was a very nice affair.
The Stardust Ballroom. It's loaded with tomatoes.
Oh, Marty, thanks a lot. That really takes a load offa my mind.
Hello, Thomas.
I'm gonna see you tonight...
I think it be a better idea if you and Thomas go out, because otherwise she's gonna start a fight with you, and everybody's gonna be yelling.
Lemme tell it, Tommy.
We want you to do a very big favor for us, Aunt Theresa.
How's Marty been lately, Aunt Theresa?
I don't wanna hear anymore about it, you hear me?
You're welcome to one of these, whatever they are.
How you, Radar?
Well...  I was going to name you Chief Surgeon...  To consult on both shifts, yours and Frank's.
No.  Or why you should.
That's okay. Live a little, learn a little.
The chest-cutter.
A native is someone who is born in a particular place.
Sure you have, only as 'Spearchucker' Jones.
I worked with Spearchucker my first month over here, at the 72nd Evac in Taegu. Most of the colored guys know who he is but they're not talking because he asked them not to.
We got to start rehabilitating, Duke, if we want to be halfway human by the time we get back to our wives.
People will talk.
And I'm grateful for you, Frank, especially with those boors around. We've grown very close in a short time.
Shut up or I'll tear you apart.
A football game?
You willing to b-back that up with odds?
At ease. Captain Pierce, you have a seriously wounded patient for whom you are responsible. Yet I find you in a poker game.
What?
You betcher ass, General.
I want to talk to you, Pierce.
We had a team at the 325th Evac last fall. I coached the boys myself.
Now we're working out a schedule of the outfits we're going to play this year. We all chip into a pool and make bets.
Hawkeye's asking the Major's opinion on a point of anatomy.
C-A-M-E-M...?
If you don't know what you've seen, why should I?
The black capsule. Finest kind. Thank you, Dr. McIntyre.
Just like we thought, it's a routine problem. Nurse, who's in charge of operating room preparations?
And if it isn't, why don't we call Washington on your telephone? You tell your story, we'll tell ours.
Radar!
Yeah, and he's lost a lot of blood. I'm afraid it's hit more that just the lung.
You aspirate the blood from the chest cavity. Damn, there's more of it than I thought.
Not necessarily.
That's right. We work well together.
That don't surprise me. If you're a good observer, you must have observed by now that Frank Burns is a jerk.
It's my name. Maybe that sounds silly to you but...
No, thank you. I'm not the slightest bit interested.
We may be in trouble, I can't catch my breath. I've got the occupational disease of oversized ex-athletes.
No trouble at all.  Hawkeye.
'The Last of the Mohicans.' Only book my father ever read.
Same here.
Of course not.
You think he won't.
I'm fond of Painless, and I'd feel terrible if anything happened to him...
Second pint.
Thanks, Reverend. Thank you both for tipping me off.  You don't know a Captain Forrest or a Captain Pierce, do you?
Every time we feed him, it either comes right back up or he coughs and turns blue and has a hell of a time.
Right, Ho-Jon. See you later.
I - wouldn't - wish - it - on - a - maneating - shark.
If you mean...  She is a lieutenant in the Army Nursing Corps, Captain.
There's no reason good enough for one medical officer to strike another.
One of the surgeons from the day shift will have to stay on duty tonight?
The way I run an organization, any man in it has the right to speak his mind.
I used to throw the javelin.
They can't do that to me!
What's that, Henry?
I been out of action since I got over here five months ago.
Colonel Merrill is a veteran of twenty- five years in the Regular Army, a soldier first and a doctor second. A member of several patriotic organizations, he believes it's America's God-given mission to maintain a foothold for freedom on the Asian mainland.
Nice.
He likes you well enough to stick around.
Hello.
No, thank you.
About me?
You were? I thought you were chasing me?
Look, John-what we're handing them are platitudes. Things they've heard a million times: "Love thy neighbor," "Clouds have silver linings," "Turn the other cheek." It's just a-
All right, but present it to him as a great cause for the common man.
No, no, no-that's your seat.
A third party?
No, no, no. This man's going to jump off a roof.
Yes, I know, dear, but Mrs. Burke had her baby yesterday. Nine pounds! And there wasn't a thing in the house-and then this morning the Community Chest lady came around and-
The Websters.
Do you mean the speech you're writing?
Well, honey, of course I don't know what kind of a speech you're trying to write, but judging from the samples I've read, I don't think anybody'll listen.
Father's . . . I never knew he had a diary.
Look, Mr. Connell . . . I just can't afford to be without work right now, not even for a day. I've got a mother and two kid sisters to . . .
Oh!
Uh-huh. You said you wanted fireworks.
So?
Well, you're catching on.
Oh, the Chronicle would consider it dirt cheap.
Oh.
Friend of his. They play duets together.
Before you pop too many buttons, don't forget to make out that check for a thousand.
Well, what about it?  Let them see him!  We'll go them one better. They can also hear him.  You own a radio station, Mr. Norton. Why not put him on the air?
That's fine, honey. Now, get out!
Thank you.
Trying to improve the world by jumping off buildings. You couldn't improve the world if the building jumped on you!
You shouldn't have gotten out of bed, Miss.
Yeah, a little.
Uh-huh. Till my wing[4] went bad.
Beany!
. . . Tubby?
Tell him about making Sourpuss chairman, honey.
What Bert's trying to say is-well-we need you, Mr. Doe. There were a lot of us didn't believe what that man said.
Yeah, sure. Er, you know Grubbel, for instance.
Well, thank you for listening. Goodbye, Mr. Doe. You're a wonderful man and it strikes me you can be mighty useful walking around for a while.
You ain't gonna get me to stay here.
The elevators are still runnin'.
Five thousand bucks!  I had it right in my hand!
Yeh. Say, how much money we got left?
John Doe Club?
Uh-huh. That's exactly what I thought. Beany, go on down to the office, tell Pop to give you the speech. There's a copy on my desk.
Nobody's gonna do that, Mr. Connell. They can't use the John Doe Clubs for politics. That's the main idea.
Why, D. B., you're not going to fall for-
Well?
Better get that story in, Hank, it's getting late.
Well, the paper said there were some jobs around loose. Thought there might be one left over.
And what about the suicide note? You didn't write that, either!
Thanks.
No, she just left. I'm surprised you didn't run into her. She went over to Mr. Norton's house.
Did you want to see her about something important?
You mean you'd like me to do it, huh?
Feller runs the Chronicle .  Here's the speech you make-and it's all written out for you.
Hold him.  Yes, Mrs. Brewster, I'm listening.
I didn't see anything.
No, sir.
Oh, n-no, sir. The sea-gull is a lovely bird.
Hello, Roper. Glad you could join us.
You're my hero.
Deal.
You worried about me, too? The chief's worried about me. Solis is worried about me. Maybe you guys should start some kind of organization.
This cousin of yours... What's his name?
Particles, man. I feel them all the time. I feel them in my arms and legs man, that's how they punish me.
I'll tell him. Where does he live. We'll get him on the phone right now.
I what?
...a car.
What's the suspect's name?
Solis said to keep you clear of this.
Is that all?
You'll get it. But, Joe, I want you to do something for me. Let me take a look around inside. Make sure everybody's okay.
Open the bag, dump everything on the table.
I'll worry about that. Let's get on with it.
Like it had to be done.
Furthest point I could find from New York.
It was okay.
Oh, "city girl". Don't you ever long for companionship with her such a long way away in New Jersey?
Every couple of months, huh?
Thanks for clearing that up.  I hear your former girlfriend is going out with Greg Barnett.
Yes.
Thou shall not kill... You've killed, right?
So why would you hesitate to lie to save lives?
Fine.
Now she's going out with Greg Barnett?
That's okay. That's his style.
We lost.
Occasionally you lose.
I don't know, but I've got to get on there.
Bullshit! Would it have happened to you?
Don't know. She keeps screaming to stay out. He keeps screaming to stay out. We decided to stay out.
You don't know shit, and I suggest you leave.
I ain't interested in your life story.
Doing what? Cleaning toilets?
Really?! He's a wonderful guy. He makes two million a year, and he worships me.
Oh, I've got to get a shot of this.
Hey yourself. Came by to see Troy.
You heard.
What do you want from me?
Don't try to make me feel guilty. The whole time we were together, you went out of your way to prove you didn't need me. Now, suddenly, for one night, you need me again. I can't do it. I can't be more than your friend. Because I know what will happen. In a few weeks you'll be back on top, and you'll shut me out just as soon as you don't need me again.
I was going to catch the last half on TV.
And it's hard to get.
Scottie...
Whoa! Wait a minute, Ronnie. Hold on. I know it's beautiful here. The sun, the sand, the sea and all that nature shit can really get to you. But we've got to keep our perspective here. This place isn't real. This isn't reality.
I mean I said this trip should be a 'roadtest'.
Come on. Stay up there, Cozy Girl...
Cozy Girl in front by a neck... Now a head...
Depends. What's up?
Hey, you just got a five thousand dollar raise. Get a car of your own.
Who's running it?
-- Two million people lost in the digital night.  What do they seek?
-- But don't you remember?  I'm already dead.
No, not me, I've been lucky.  But I've seen what happens to other people --
About what?
No...
Wake up?!
True.  But why?
In a computer program.
It's not real.
Unfinished business.
We're going to have to reconfigure.
New York.
Go!
-- Come on, you know F.C.O. regs. Anyone caught with their R and D hand in the bio-digitization cookie jar spends the rest of their life in federal penitentiary.  It's not worth it.
You've got the keys, send someone in --
Good question.
Then where is she?
No.
-- The inside?
Realize?
Not you.  A copy.
This.  No point to it.
Of course you do.  And the only shot you've got of keeping your ass from sinking in a sea of shit is to tell me where you got this program.
-- Standard.
IMPACT IN EIGHT SECONDS!
How can we reach Phaedos?
Now tell me... what do you see?
I'll be at the Observatory Sunday.
Outside of his time warp he's aging at a vastly acellerated rate!
I've got it!  We use the mirrors to reflect the light back into itself!!
WHITE TIGER!
What does that mean?!
Don't lose hope yet, Alpha!
TRICERATOPS!
NINJA WOLF ZORD!
Release the power with the power.
OUR MORPHERS ARE ON LINE!
THERE'S THE COMET!
A real shame.
Did I say anything?
Ah, the old and doddering.  I'm going to SCOURGE their puny minds, reducing them to ZOMBIE'S. And then I'll put them to work rebuilding my empire.
Well, if I did I certainly wouldn't say it to you!
Strength in numbers!!
And I am the Falcon, Winged Lord of the Sky!
The Bismark in Chicago. You familiar?
But I've never served a day.
But ya got a Boss.
Maybe. But he'd still be the Boss.
Tell me something, Meyer. How can you get up at dawn to walk on the beach if you're on your honeymoon?
Whatever you say, Boss.
I guess I am. Just a little.
Mr. Rothstein, Can I be frank? You're a gambler, and I know you've had losses. I also know you could sell to Maranzano or Masseria for fifty G's, but nobody sells to those guys once. So if ya really got another buyer, and ya wanna welch, I ain't gonna beef.
From your mouth ta God's ear.
He was around...
But if ya can't catch the guys...
Long as Charlie says.
That ain't what your mama said.
Sure, Frankie. Fuck me. Fuck Meyer. Fuck Arnold Rothstein who's made us all rich. All so you can be an fuckin' honorary Sicilian!
If he's gonna fuck me up the ass!
We're gonna be the winning side. It's like Rothstein said about that guy in Austria. We're gonna use Maranzano and Masseria. Let 'em knock each other bloody. And then, when everybody's screamin' for peace, we step in to make it. What they're fight in' over, everybody will beg us to take.
I can just imagine.
I'm already late.
You're sure?
It's a mask.
I'm doin' business here!
Lansky. Meyer Lansky. And that's Bugsy Siegel ya got there.
A million bucks. In the last six months.
Without us, Masseria don't stand a chance, and he knows it.
Guess I'm not a single type guy.
I'll talk to Nucky. Get you set up like the fuckin' Prince of Wales.
Like a party for all our friends.
And if we don't invite Maranzano, we can't invite Masseria. Guys don't wanna be choosin' sides.
It's not myself I'm worried about.
Is there a fuckin' point comin' up anytime soon?
Masseria won't have any choice but to trust you. And as long as we keep the Boss alive, Maranzano can't win without you.
I know. When the storm hits, it don't pay to be caught outside.
Calculated risks. But Boss, this one don't calculate.
He'll know you were smart enough to stay away, Boss.
You gotta plan these things.
Tell me, Charlie. Please.
Don, I'd be honored.
I don't fuck my partners.
You're fuckin' crazy. You're all fuckin' crazy!
What makes you think I give a damn about that Sicilian crap?
You disrespect our tradition.
No matter what you say to me Salvatore, you are my bambino.
I turned him down flat.
We can operate around these guys.
If it comes to that. Yeah.
Because the world ain't big enough for the Dons. So we gotta choose between our friends and ourselves. It ain't the way I'd make the world, but that's the way it is.
Kinda early for Christmas, Bugs.
But only on purpose, Tommy.
Yeah...before your time.
Switch hands.
Julie, that stuff probably saved his life.
Uhh - martini?
I didn't say anything.
I dress up when I want to make an impression. - So how'd it go?
It's irregular, but...I just love that strip of yours. I figure I'll take the "Family Circus" guy instead.
Thank me next time you see me.
Being rich is <u>not a trap</u>. That is a dirty lie perpetuated by rich people to keep the failures from killing them.
That's not going to stop his nightmare -
Mr. Hypnos, I saw a dream. My girlfriend was having it. She dreamed they were pulling the plug on me. She was watching me <u>die</u>.
Monkeybone...!?
Baby? Why don't you just...rest on the sofa for a minute. I'll be right back.
Ohhh, nothing.
It looks so...<u>new</u>.
Yeah, I <u>could</u>, but the thing is, if later got here sooner, it would be...better.
It was great, baby. Let's get you to the ER.
I'm fine, Kimmy. Fine.
Give me a date, Doctor.
This is hard for me, Julie...very hard...but it's been three months now, and... <i></i> I gave the order.
Yeah. To see if he could expedite my case. But I wait, and I wait, and...I'm starting to think I'll never see her again.
Kitty...<u>my</u> situation is really not important. The thing is, my girlfriend is now living with, and possibly engaged to, a demented monkey.
Stu? Stu? Let's not disturb the nice Reaper.
Let's not kick the nice Reaper's ass.
Well - yeah - but that doesn't...<u>apply</u>. It was different then. I was <u>depressed</u>. My life is great now. I'm in love!
<i></i> I've got one chance to get back to Julie, and I'm gonna take it - with or without you.
Now we just gotta figure out how to get there.
Oh, <u>sure</u>. Mr. Action Hero! Why couldn't I be Arnold Schwarzenegger's figment?
Yeah, sure, no problem, you're welcome.
I'm just concerned about my daughter.
Uh-huh?
I've never had any problem with them. People say it's the safest block in the East Village.  I just hope their motorcycles don't keep you up at night.
Aaron?
Are you sure you got my bag in?
And where is she?
So, you come here all by yourself?
This way?
Daniel Webster? Sat here? Say--that man was a great orator.
Not me, sonny. I'm just going to sit around and listen.  What's this?
Oh, yes--they're fine people--regular people.
It couldn't be.
What for? Why, suppose there's a storm--all lines are down--how you gonna get a message to Ma?
Hey--you're into me for a buck already. I say--McGann. Shoot the whole dollar.
Whadaya mean--*right*?
He isn't going to hurt enough as it is. *She* has to twist a knife in him, too--the regal jackass! "I'll turn my glamour on him," she says--
We're gonna get married.
You said it!
Huh?
Well, then, that's great! And that's a great place to leave it! It's no use *my* barging into this now and--
He's a house-afire!
Whom are you calling--in the dead of night?
That settles it! I will not be attacked and belittled by my own children in my own home! My nerves are strained to the breaking point!
Yup--Sweeney, Flood, Farrell--waiting for you--
*You* tell Jim Taylor.
He's the hero of fifty thousand boys and a hundred thousand parents. Look at these congratulations pouring in! I tell you, gentlemen, by this one statesman-like act, I have--
Jim--the answer to a prayer--manna from heaven--the man *we want*--and the votes *we need*--
Y-yes, Jim.
The--head?
Well, Jeff put that out himself.
What stuff?
Than what?
Is--uh--Jefferson Smith at home?
Why, of course.
Yeah, for the fifth time, Senator-- Washington.
Boy! My head's like a balloon--for two whole days. I never knew there was so much American history.
For one week!
His last fight was his best, Jeff. He and his little four-page paper against that mining syndicate and all to defend the right of one small miner who stuck to his claim. You know, they tried everything, bribery, intimidation, then--well--
No.
The *Bills*? Jeff--let me advise you-- as your father would--politics is a business--sometimes a cruel business. In your time here, you couldn't even start on those Bills. They're put together by legal minds--after a long study. Why, after twenty years, I can't understand half of them myself. No, really, Jeff--in your own interests--
Well, why not do it? There's a job for you. Get a Bill started to accomplish it--present it to Congress-- it would be a great experience--
Will he yield for a question?
Will he *yield*?
I *did* see Taylor! And I was in that room!
You mean--you tell these men--and Senator Paine what to do?
You're a liar!
Office of--Senator Smith?
The man downstairs said number--
Oh, no--no!  My dear *Senator*--it may be customary out on the prairie to take French leave of people and not be heard of again for five hours--
There *what* was?
Well--he's got nothing on me.
You--uh--you better relax, Senator. You'll be plumb wore out.
Convene?
With or without 'em.  Twelve--noon. The Senate convenes at twelve o'clock.
Well, then, I--I *thank* you, Miss Saunders! Nothing better could have happened--. Yes *sir*, Miss Saunders, we're going right ahead with it!
Yes. Sure. It was his idea. *I* should have been the one to think of it--
Right.
Oh, but this one is so simple.
Oh--dinner. Yes. Well, I'm hungry, too. I thought--maybe--we could have something brought in--you know, like big executives who eat off trays. You see, we've got to light into this and get it going--
Why?
*This* is.
City-dwellers never do that--for fear of what might drop *in* 'em.
No, they couldn't. Father was a doctor. The kind who placed ethics above collections. That speaks well for Father but it always left us kind of--  Could we get on with this, Senator?
Go right ahead.
Terrible, thank you.
Now, *Susan*--that's really a *pretty* name--
Second drawer.
Saunders--!
I'm not.
That's funny. I thought all along--  Gee--I--I'm glad to see you. I *thought* of you--I mean--I wanted to talk to someone and--well--  --Mr. Lincoln hasn't much to say--  Saunders--I'm not fit to sit up in the Senate--haven't you heard?--I robbed boys of their pennies and dimes!
Oh--Saunders--
Not *me*! Joseph Paine is the man they ought to be listening to! Come on!
Hold on, fellows--I'm not used to more then one question at a time--
I'm splendid, too.
And how's your bill, Senator?
I--I'm sorry, sir. I--I have a bill--
Well--I haven't needed much law so far--what I'd like to get first is a little common sense--
What's the matter?
Listen--tomorrow I take him to see monuments--if I have to hit him over the head with a couple!
Go away, Nosey.
Well, well!
Okay. See you here.
Well--that's very fine.  Saunders, some person in your office says you've quit--
I meant it for one. I meant--Sam Foley couldn't get along without you-- and neither can I at the moment--
Jim--if what you say about the future is remotely possible--why not do as I say--drop things like this dam?
Well, then appoint Miller--if you're sure he'll take orders.
Wait a minute--Jim--you didn't ask *Smith* over here!
I don't want any part of crucifying this boy.
Jim, you don't have to--
Jim, it's just that I like the kid-- I don't want to see you get too rough on him.
Maybe he won't get up.
No--I--I'll take a walk-- 
What! Not Ol' Honest Abe!
It was *I* who rose in this Chamber to accuse him. He is saying that I was carrying out criminal orders on falsified evidence--
Finally, there was only one answer to a man like him--the truth--which I rose and gave to this body!  Mr. President--he has told lie upon lie--every lie a desperate attempt to conceal his own guilt. And now, he is trying to blackmail this Senate-- as he tried to blackmail me! To prevent his expulsion, he would probably even try to hold up this Deficiency Bill--vital to the whole country--which must be passed immediately--*today*! *Anything*--to force you to clear his bad name and save his hide!  Gentlemen--I--I have no more patience with this--this *rascally* character. I apologize to this body for his appointment--I regret I had ever known him. I--I'm sick and tired of this contemptible young man and I refuse to listen to him any longer! I hope every member of this body feels as I do!
Sometimes he whistles.
Never can tell what he's going to do.
Yes, you own it.
Always.
Uh-huh.
Yes, sir.
Thank you very much.
Yes.
Yes!!!
Look, this is my house. I'd like to-
You were a lady in distress, weren't you?
No. That is, I didn't-  Until I met you. I like talking to you, though-  Imagine my finding you right on my doorstep.
I enjoy it.
I'm from a small town too, you know.
Probably as small as Mandrake Falls.
You have?
What did he play?
Sure. Look! You sing it over again, and I'll do "Humoresque" with you.
I'd like to read it some time.
Gosh, she looks better every time I see her.
Let's just walk, okay?
Yes, here we are again.  Good night.
I'm crucifying him.
Is he? Yeah, I thought so, too. I tried to laugh, but I couldn't. It stuck in my throat.
He's got goodness, Mabel. Do you know what that is?
No - of course you don't. We've forgotten. We're too busy being smart-alecks.  Too busy in a crazy competition for nothing.
Tell him I had to leave suddenly. I got a job in China - some place.
We're not going out tonight.
With pay!
I was the world's sweetest ingenue.
Tonight, maybe.  I'll phone him at noon.  Oh, my lunch hour. I'm a stenographer, you know. Mary Dawson.
Yes.
Babe ought to get him drunk again.
I don't care what I said. I can't strangle him, can I!
Me, sir?
Thank you. Now don't touch a thing. Leave everything as it is.
Let me go! I wanna see him!
Suppose you just answer, Miss Jane. Now, will you tell the Court what everybody at home thinks of Longfellow Deeds?
What was that you said he was?
Sorry, Mac, I can't. Yeah, Mac. Sure, but I ain't the attorney-
Yes. You see, rich people need someone to keep the crowds away. The world's full of pests. Then there's the newspapers to handle. One must know when to seek publicity - and when to avoid it.
I'll tell those mugs to keep their shirts on, that you'll be right down.
Make three reservations on the first train out to Mandrake Falls, Vermont.
Mandrake Falls.  M-A-N-
Yes.
Who - me? No.
What for?
Oh, I wasn't worried about that.
I was wondering where they're going to get another tuba player for the band.
Huh?
A lawyer representing some woman with a claim against the estate.  Tell him to see me at my office.
You're not my attorney yet, Mr. Cedar. Not till I find out what's on your mind. Suppose you get the books straightened out quick so I can have a look at them.
No, thanks.
That's very kind of you. Are you related to him?
Well, we'd like to find out something about him. What does he do for a living?
Yes, indeed. I wonder why he left me all that money? I don't need it.
Nah.
"There once was a man named Cobb, Who kept Semple away from the mob. Came the turn of the tide And Semple - he died - And now poor Cobb's out of a job!"
Oh, I don't mean that. I'm sure I'm going to need your help.
Entertainment?
What do they mean by this - "Cinderella Man!"
Listen. Listen, Longfellow. You've got brains, kid. You'll get along swell if you'll only curb your homicidal instincts - and keep your trap shut. Don't talk to anybody! These newshounds are out gunning for you.
Thank you.  If you feel the building rock, it'll be me blasting into this editor.
Shut up!
They can have the Estate.
Well, then, we must give the wrong kind of shows.
Yes. Your uncle's common-law wife. She has a legal claim on the estate.
Well, I play the tuba.
You mean to tell me you don't carry a pocketful around with you?
Well, I don't know where to begin. There's been so many things said about me that I-
Not at all.
Thank you, Your Honor.
You gentlemen going to stay for lunch?
What - tails?  Why, that's a monkey suit![5] Do you want people to laugh at me?  I never wore one of those things in my life.
Why, I'm assisting you, sir.
That was something I was never able to find out, sir.
You have no pants, sir.
Better bring me some coffee, Walter.
Who?
You try it.
Yes, sir.
Really? You think so?
Uh-huh. What are they?
What's that?
No, not really.
You never got back to me.  ...I called to say we'd like to take you out for a meal?... Kind of a professional welcome.
Dorothy Fowler. Fantastic woman. She passed last year in a train wreck. Damned Amtrak.
What kind of doubts?
I don't want to hear any more today.
Without trust, there's no point to any of this. You might as well not come.
Henry!
You came because it's taking over. You're in its grip.
What?!
-- I find it degrading. Maximum gynecology and minimum turn-on --
And the experiment is in here?
There's absolutely no reason to think this is going to have any impact on you. I'm embarrassed to have --
She seems very unhappy.
I'd better get in there.
Lily, I don't think even you could know that --
Where am I supposed to eat?
...so accomplished.
Come out this way. There's no shame in getting a little therapy... is there, Althea?
Thanks for your help, Lionel.
That would explain it.
Martin.
You think that now! You think it's a bunch of hooey, don't you?
Hmm.
No one ever thought so. You must bring it out.
Maybe you'll catch it.
Maybe... but you're the one whose ass is dragging.
Sorry... I'm done.
Did you get headaches before this?  But you get more now? Or more severe?
I don't know if I'm going to make it the whole way.
Yes.
I thought I had something to tell you. But it turned out I didn't.
You're upset.
I don't follow you.
Okay...
What was that?
Transference.
Which show was that?
You're not the only one...
I want to spend the rest of my life with you... but I'm not sure you feel the same way.
What do you mean, "in no time"?
Weekly or monthly?
It's a big part of the show.
What happened today?
Uh-huh.
Do you think that's what he wants?
Really?
Is that the question?
I'm impressed. I couldn't make three million dollars if I lived three lifetimes.
No... I've seen her. Good-looking woman.
Yeah.  Guy's got some serious sex fantasies.
It's just a thought.
You are Panda, monarch of modems.
Really?
Just you.
Doesn't matter. You can call me Doc.
Holy shit!
That'd be Lily.
All new people start with that...
I'm honored.
What'd I do?
Yes, yes it does...
Yes. To Hamunaptra. To perform the ritual.
You're not going to kill us?
Just looking for you, O'Connell! I wanted to be with my friend!
To have stopped this creature? Yes!
Yeah! It's supposed to be made outta pure gold!
Water turning to blood.
What did you do to him!?
Yeah, I'm not leavin, this fort for nothin'.
Yeah, get me a glass of bourbon, a shot of bourbon and a bourbon chaser.
I did not know, so when I heard you were coming, I asked him that myself.
I would pay one hundred pounds just to see him hang.
Twenty.
What are you doing here?
Who cares? I don't see no treasure.
No... You came to ask me about Hamunaptra.
I just decked your brother
No, I mean --
The only thing that scares me, Mister O'Connell, are your manners.
Who was talking about what?
That bad huh?
It's just a book, no harm ever came from a book.
Yeah? So? Is that my problem?
Look lady, I appreciate you saving my life and all, but when I signed on, I agreed to take you out there and bring you back, and I did, now were even, end of job, end of story, contract terminated.
What?... Oh yeah, that was just um, you know, figure a speech.
Undoubtedly, I know the breed, he may be a cowboy, but his word is his word.
Don't blame me, I don't even remember being there.
Read the inscription on the cover!
Yes,... I see.
Awfully.
And it stinks to high heaven in here.
We'll sneak up and steal that book right out from under them.
No kiddin', without a key, it'll take us a month to crack this thing,
And then he'll be coming after Evy.
You have got to be joking?
Darling, you've got the wrong idea.
Do it, big boy!
But you're a superhero.
I know... My girlfriends all dumped me after I put on the mask. They thought I'd lost it.
Sure.
It doesn't matter what we call ourselves. We know who we are.
And I'm gonna nip it in the bud.
Really?
I thought you'd chickened out on me.
I saw him walk you home.
Alone tonight?
Nothing wrong with being a waitress.
I just want to be a superhero.
Are you nuts? Get out of there!
What?
We had an off night, that's all.
What have the famous superheroes got that we don't?
How could I see him if he's invisible?
But look at him... and look at us.
I lost another fork tonight. She's getting suspicious, I know it.
I can't.
Roy, when was the last time you had an actual date?
But we don't know for sure it's the same guy.
Are you serious? This is the break we've been waiting for!
Yes.
We prefer to think of ourselves as unsung... I am the Blue Raja, Master of Silverware... 
Because... I'M A SUPERHERO!
But... the silverware?
Definitely.
The who?
Yeah, but how do we get to them?
But we gotta find out what's going on in there.
Through there!
I can appreciate what Your Majesty is saying but the Emperor has staked everything on this policy.  He has no other way to attack England, and no one knows more than Your Majesty how his overtures for peace have been rejected.
I am in no position to debate this with you, Your Majesty, but can you imagine what a blow it will be to the Emperor if you should now desert his cause?  It would mean nothing less than victory for England.
Very well, General, what is it you wish to say?
Yes, General Kutusov, I daresay that this has been considered and discussed at great length.  Napoleon would simply spend the winter in Moscow and continue the campaign in the spring.  Another lesser possibility might be to march on St. Petersburg now, although there is some doubt that he has the strength to do this, until he refits his army.
Perhaps it would be even more serious than that, Your Majesty. His European confederation is held together by some very slender threads.  Your Majesty knows even better than I that Austria and Prussia are very doubtful allies, and the Emperor has reason enough to fear that they will turn on him, at the first sign of weakness.
I, personally, am convinced that he will withdraw his army from Moscow, and attempt to establish himself in Poland for the winter.  In the end, he will not allow himself to be cut off from Paris.  But I believe that if he is offered any encouragement, by Your Majesty, he will postpone this decision as long as possible. He is a gambler and he will trust to his luck.
General Kutusov, I would like to call a meeting of my cabinet tomorrow morning and have you present this idea to them.  I think it has merit and is worthy of consideration.
Whatever suggested the idea to you?
Yes, with all due respect, I do Citizen Barras.
I'm sorry, I was at the theater and I didn't receive your note until I returned to my hotel.
Things are quite serious, I should say.
Are you serious?
Are you proposing to transfer command to me?
Our lives, the revolution, my career?
They are at the gates of Paris, sire.
It is on this road, sire, following me.
Paris is evacuated, sire.  The enemy is to enter at nine o'clock tomorrow morning.  The National Guard is on duty at the gates.
A treaty?  Don't be ridiculous. What treaty is this?  Who made it? Who has been giving orders?
What cowardice!  What treason! Joseph has ruined everything.  How could they all lose their heads. They knew I was coming up fast. Victory was just within grasp. Come, come, turn your troops around, General Belliard.
Let me see it.
Thank you, sir.  I will do that.
I haven't been back for ten years. Is your family still there?
I thought not.  I noticed you by yourself, all night.
Ah, Didier -- you are alive.
From what we can tell, there are hundreds of agents, all over the city.  The combustibles seem to have been carefully placed beforehand, and all the fire-engines have been removed from the city.
What is that?
But this is not a matter which can be settled tonight, surely?
I believe you issued an order that all citizens of Paris must hand over any weapons that they have in their possession.
I very much doubt that he will.
I'm afraid he has been rather upset by the outcome of the battle.
Francis, may I ask whether you wear warm winter underwear?
Good evening, Mademoiselle.
Is it a nice warm room, sir?
Would you like to take me there, so that we can get warm, sir?
Lisette.
You must not act impetuously.
Yes.  They were the easiest.  I made love to one of them within ten minutes of our first meeting.
All right -- I promise.
I know what you're doing in there.
I thought he would be seeing you before I would, and would give it to you.
I didn't want to hurt you... All I wanted to do was to keep from hurting you.  I swear I didn't want to hurt you.
My God, what do you think?
Yes.
And was it so widely known that Joseph had reason for such concern?
My regrets, my dear Major, but I believe you have been blocking the road.
Before you quote the rules of the road to me, Major, may I point out to you that you are not in France now, but that you are a guest in Russia.
Yes, I do -- very much.
Did the Emperor or Empress give you any... instructions of any kind... before you left?
No.
Alexander and I are friends.  We have reached an understanding.
He will stand by his agreement -- I know him better than you do.
Monsieur Varlac, do not pretend to speak for these good people whom you have misled and inflamed with violent speech.  Now, I order you to come down from the cart.
Major Lavallette to see you, General.
A message from Citizen Fouche.
Life is a burden for me.  Nothing gives me any pleasure; I find only sadness in everything around me.  It is very difficult because the ways of those with whom I live, and probably always shall live, are as different from mine as moonlight is from sunlight.
From that moment on, I foresaw what I might be.  Already I felt the earth flee beneath me, as if I were being carried away up to the sky.
Anything you need.
And I can go free?
Uncle Elroy, who's that girl by Day-Day's car?
Why you say that?
Yup.
Don't move me.
I'll do it.
Well get along with this one.  Go ahead of us.  Don't get seen and don't let that mutt out of your sight.
Cheeco.
I know, that's when Uncle Elroy cussed out everybody, and threw up in Aunt Faye's backseat.
I know, we had a good time.  But ever since you guys moved out here, it seems like we've lost touch.
Yeah, that's me.  Just a little somethin' somethin' I picked up.
Man, after taxes, lawyer fees, and paying off my daddy's bad credit, we didn't end up with a million.  We bought this house and I spent the rest on this.  It's the bomb, huh?
Oh, yeah, where you work at?
I went back to Watts to sell my old car and met her on the way.  Worst day of my life.
You don't know Baby D.
I don't know.  Did ya'll forget to pay it or something?
Damn...how much money ya'll got left from the lottery?
D'Wana brought Baby'D up here.
You already in.
I don't.
Nothing.
Naw, I'm got live ghetto fabulous.  make sure you get that car fixed.
Better sooner than later.
What are you doing here?
I'm sorry to hear that.
It's locked.
Okay.
Yeah, I'm cool.  See you later.
I do.
All damn.
It's alright.
Yeah, pops!
Nice to meet you?
It's a long story.  Right now we gotta do somethin'.
Sir, the manager stepped out for a moment.  I'm currently running the store. Can I see the CD?
Yeah, it was.  How you get up here?
Maybe you can ask him to loan you the money.
Go for it.
I don't know.
Hey, mister Joker, have a heart, bro. It's Friday.
He's a boy, dude.
Shhhh!  Roach, shut the fuck up.
Shut up!  Where's that other miyatea?
He moved out to Rancho Cucamonga with his cousin Day-Day.
That ain't gonna work.
I don't know the number.
Me neither.  How far is Rancho Cucamonga?
I'll take you later.
Nothing.  What you want?
Yeah, and hurry up.
Okay.  Bye, Craig.
What you doing to my nephew?
What?
What can I do for you Mr....Watson?
My security people are right next door.
That's...a comfort to hear.
And your husband works for somebody else.
For not believing you.
What?
Yes. It's OK, Lynn. These are our friends.
Yes, you will, Mr. Watson.
Where did you get these? Who are you?
The gun...
Me?
That's right. He's dead. Tell me why.
I want'to talk to her.
Look...my daughter ... she's going to die...unless you can help me.
He'll think you're in the crowd until the end of the speech. Wait a minute.
Trust me. You asked me for help. Let me help. Trust me.
I know. Brendan, listen to me. Someone is trying to kill Eleanor.
On TV.
Right.
Over and out.
No, kisses to...
Sure. Go down past the bar. Take you right out there.
Oh, man...
What?
No way, there's nothing you can do to help me.
What are you going to do?
Everybody does?
Laughs.
My daddy is going to be a hero? Like Power Rangers?
Oh, yes. I'll show you. I have much more colors at home.
You're a big girl, huh?
Help me get her off the rug.
You, Preacher?
Not even her?
I will guard Pearl with my life...
How's your sister Pearl?
There hain't nary hook in the land smart enough to hook Mister Gar. What a feller needs is mother-wit -- and a horse-hair.
You and your gypsies! They been gone a week!
It's a shame!
You ain't leavin' in no hurry if we can help it!
I know you did, Reverend. Oh, I know how you tried!
Once upon a time there was a rich king...  ...and he had him a son and a daughter and they all lived in a castle over in Africa. Well, one day this King got taken away by bad men and before he got took off he told his son to kill anyone that tried to steal their gold, and before long these bad men come back and --
'Night Miss Jenny; don't let the bedbugs bite.
I want to go upstairs. It's cold and spidery down here. I'm hungry.
Why?
That's Daddy!
I mind you said there was two.
Is that all?
You ain't my Dad! You won't never be my Dad!
Don't you believe me?
Mm-hm.
What secret shall I tell?
Miz Jenny! Miz Jenny!
Only she won't never let me play with it.
It is my shame -- my crown of thorns. And I must wear it bravely.
Do? Why stay and take care of them little kids. Maybe it was never meant for a woman like Willa to taint their young lives.
I reckon it's been ordained this way, Brother Spoon.
A scrawl. On a piece of notepaper on the bureau.
He don't mean no impudence; do you, boy?  Do you, boy? Ah, many's the time poor Brother Ben told me about these youngins.
Well, John, the night before your father died, he told me what he did with that money.
No, Harry! I thought --
Ben never told you he throwed it in the river? Did he?
She took them kids with her?
What's wrong, John?
Them kids!
What?
Look, I know it's been frightening, I know your dreams have seemed real. But... it's okay. Okay?
Since the murder. She was fine before that.
It's just made her think... her dreams are real...
She's entering deep sleep now. Heart rate's a little high due to anxiety, but otherwise she's nicely relaxed. All normal. She could dream at any time now.  Right now she's like a diver on the bottom of an ocean no one's mapped yet. Waiting to see what shows up.
Then bring us back its tail and whiskers.
Because he was scary, that's why.
Oh -- jeez -- Glen! Rod's gone ape!
No.
Uh-oh...
Shhh. Now listen, here's what we're gonna do...
Just checking -- keep out of sight!
Yeah.
I guess those people don't wake up to tell what happens.
You heard me. I grab him in the dream -- you see me struggling so you wake me up. We both come out, you cold cock the fucker, and we got him. Clever, huh?
Meanwhile whatever you do don't fall asleep. Midnight.
Dad, I want to see Rod Lane.
You don't know he did it.
You know he's dead though, right?
Just tell me who did it and I'll go get him, baby.
Oh, Jesus -- Nancy!  Hey! We got a fire!
Terrific. What the hell was she doing there?
I don't mean her --
How you know that?
I do want to know. He's not dead and gone -- he's after me and if I sleep he'll get me! I've got to know!
He doesn't know you.  Couldn't you change?
No.
He's nuts about you.
Really. Turn 'er up a little.
Came to make up, no big deal. Your ma home?
It's from Paris.
Good evening, Ninotchka.
About what?
Thank you, Anna. I'll dry it up here when I wash it next. I should hate to see our country endangered by my underwear.
Tell me... what else did you have?
You mean to tell me you wear a different dress for different times of the day?
All right, let's uphold it for another ten minutes.
...and little Lady Beatrice?
Imagine! The niece of the Czar opening the door for us.
That's right.
They accumulate millions by taking loss after loss.
But what can we do?... We have to accept.
That's right... and we might as well face it.
How many families live here with you?
Monsieur.
Which part of the room is mine?
That's right.
I think I need my glasses.
Don't worry... there will be enough.
I must be stern with you.
We have opened a restaurant...
That's all right.
Blue? Let's offset his mood. Find a striped one, and brighten it with a great blaze of tie.
Well, sir, if you should do it again, which I hope you won't, please remember the order. Counterpane, blanket, blanket, sheet, sheet.
Are they indeed? Thank you.
Yes.
Certainly.
Count d'Algout...
Let's be honest. Have we anything like it in Russia?
These may have been the jewels of the Duchess Swana, but, like all private property, they were confiscated by the State.
I give you my word! They were confiscated legally!
Oh, Leon, you are so good.
My name is Count d'Algout. I telephoned.
Get out of here!
But how will she look? The fashions this spring are very becoming to her. Gentlemen, the judge will be French, the jury will be French, everybody in that courtroom will be French. Have you ever seen a French court when a beautiful woman sits on the witness stand and lifts her skirt a little? You sit down and pull up your pants and where will it get you?
Oh, no, no. I am not a highwayman, I'm just a nuisance. All I'm trying to do is make things as difficult as possible.
Razinin.
Two thousand francs.
A day.
Brave... that's right.
Just three people in a room this size? Whew!
Monsieur.
Yes... a very slim one. I want to be fair. I don't deny that you might make out some kind of a case.
We did our best, Comrade.
I will not repeat your mistake. I will have no dealings with the Grand Duchess nor her representative.
We did our utmost to have it set ahead.
Yes. It is unfortunate.
She has been asked to leave the powder room but without success. We would appreciate if you would see to it yourself.
Not always... look at me... I've been back twice. 
You're going to force us... huh?
Gladly.
Have I? Do you know when I come to think about it it's staggering. If I add it all up I must have spent years waiting for signals. Imagine! An important part of my life wasted between whistles.
You're welcome.
I don't have to but I find it natural.
Nothing has occurred recently to shake my confidence.
Go ahead.
Well, let's say I live in it. Such a pleasant place... all kinds of comfort, easy to reach, close to street car, bus, and subway...
I will do my best.
We take off our hat and coat.  We sit down -- we make ourselves comfortable. We adjust ourselves to the prospect of a most enjoyable evening. We look at each other. We smile.  Well... we don't smile. How about some music?
I begin to believe in it myself since I've met you. I still don't know what to make of it. It confuses me, it frightens me a little, but it fascinates me, Ninotchka.
Thank you.
Oh, I see. What do you use instead?
You're the most improbable creature I've ever met in my life, Ninotchka, Ninotchka...
Wounded? How?
I'd love to.  Tsk, tsk, tsk.
That's the way a clock works. There's nothing wonderful about it. You merely feel you must put yourself in a romantic mood to add to your exhilaration.
Two Scotchmen met on the street... and I don't know the name of the street and it really doesn't matter. Well, anyway, one's name was McIntosh and the other's was McGillicuddy. McIntosh says to McGillicuddy, "Hello, Mr. McGillicuddy," and McGillicuddy says to McIntosh, "Hello, Mr. McIntosh," and then McIntosh says to McGillicuddy, "How is Mrs. McGillicuddy?" and then McGillicuddy says to McIntosh, "How is Mrs. McIntosh?"...
Foolish? If this dress were to walk down the boulevard all by itself I would follow it from one end of Paris to the other, and when I caught up with it I would say, "Just a moment, you charming little dress, I want you to meet Ninotchka... you two were meant for each other." Ninotchka feels more comfortable.
Anything, Ninotchka.
It's always good luck to launch something with champagne; a battleship... or an evening.
You must, darling.
You just made that trip from goats to grapes a little too fast.
What, darling?
They are all Duchesses here... thousands of Duchesses... and I am going to tell them.
I love you, my little Leonitchka!
All right, we'll make it red.
It's a little box that you buy on the installment plan and before you tune it in they tell you they have a new model.
Well, then we turn twice to the right and stop at seven...
No, no music.
...but big.
Good morning, Swana.
Darling, I was busy looking out for your interests.
I understand how you feel, but there is a limit to everything, particularly pride and dignity. They are willing to pay any price! They have a circulation of two million!
Oh, yes.
Well... er... I caught a glimpse of her when she walked through the lobby.
There are a hundred ways to approach it, but I feel it can best be said in one simple phrase. I'm in love, Swana.
Has done what?
Hello.
Just in case they don't give you your visa to Russia I want you to know that I have signed a contract for my memoirs and rented a lovely little ch?teau in the Touraine, and if you feel the need of a change...
We have nothing to discuss.
Madame, what is it you people always say, regardless of what you mean... "I am delighted to have you here"? I have not reached that stage of civilization.
I told you we had plenty to talk about. Shall we sit down?
Won't those two years in court be expensive for you? I know that money was no object as long as you could squeeze it from the pockets of the people, but now...
Yes.
No.
That is for me to decide, Comrade Yakushova.
I don't understand.
This will do. 
Raw carrots and beets.
Where the hell is he?
"Ex-CIA"?  There's no such thing as "ex-CIA," John -- they're all Ivy League Establishment.  Is he one of these guys with a beef against us?
Sirica's just trying to force one of them to testify.  But they're solid.
Son of a bitch.
Pay him.  Pay him what he wants.
Uh huh ...
I mean, who the hell cares about this penny-ante shit.  Goldwater put it right.  He said: "Well for Christ's sake, everybody bugs everybody else; we know that." ... It's the cover-up, not the deed that's really bad here.  If only Mitchell could step up and take the brunt of it; give them the hors d'oeuvre and maybe they won't come back for the main course.  That's the tragedy of all this.  Mitchell's going to get it in the neck anyway. It's time he assumed some responsibility.
I'll bet he would.
In Richard Nixon's long history of underhanded dealings, he has never gotten better value for his money.  If I were to open my mouth, all the dominoes would fall.
I'm one of his people.  The Cubans are his people.  And we're going to jail for him.
Christ, we created Frankenstein with those fucking Cubans.
Find out what the hell he was doing at "CREEP."  This could be trouble. These CIA guys don't miss a trick. This could be a set-up.
Well, sir ... it turns out -- one of the people implicated is still, you see, on our White House payroll.
He left his White House phone number in his hotel room.
I don't know if I'd go that far, sir.
No ... I can do this because I've spent my whole career building anti Communist credentials.
The hard-core four million "Nixon nuts" aren't gonna go for it ... They'll say I sold out to the Communists.
It's marked.  Also there's June twenty third.  And this year -- March twenty first.  Those are the ones ...
Damn right.  And there's still a helluva lotta people out there who wanna believe ... That's the point, isn't it?  They wanna believe in the President.
Cox!  Fire him.
He's completely lost touch with reality.
It's gone.  No one will ever find out what's on it.
Evidently to install bugs and photograph documents.
It's possible they were looking for evidence of an illegal Howard Hughes donation to the Democrats, so the Democrats couldn't make an issue of your Hughes money.
It was right after the Pentagon Papers broke.  They went in to get his psychiatric records.
Silence!
"National Priority."
We'll work on it.  I say we cut ourselves loose from these clowns and that's all there is to it.
He'll need a pretext.  He'll never figure one out for himself.
The only problem with that, sir -- it gets us into obstruction of justice.
How is this national security?
Sir?
Yes, sir.  I'll talk to Helms, and, uh ... what's our press position on this Watergate thing?  What do I tell Ziegler to tell them?
The bastard!  If I'd called his shot on Cuba I would've won.  He made me look soft.
Before?!  Eisenhower approved that?
So?  You wanted Castro dead. Everybody wanted Castro dead.  If Hunt and the others are CIA, why don't we just throw this back in the CIA's lap? Let Richard Helms take the fall?
You never told him?
Money.  Follow the money.
This could be it ... this could be it. Four long years ...
My God, my God!  He talked to the New York Times?
Right.  They don't trust!  They don't trust America!
It's Helms -- it's got to be.
What about the documents he promised?
Why me?
Did he have to die for me to get it?!
I'm not Jack Kennedy.  Your agency is secure.
The President would support a reasonable request for an increase.
Yes.  And you will give General Cushman full access.
How about you?  Are you going to win?
Yes.  Your old friend from Cuba.
That was a mistake.  The White House was full of Kennedy people then.  It still is.
Injections.  Even this noble sport's been fixed.  Seen the guys?
The White House.
"A warrior with nerves of steel is yet broken by a thread of silk." Nietzsche.
We'll see about that.
Jack, we're not living in the same country you and I knew in '46.  Our people are just not gonna sacrifice in major numbers for war.  We can't even get 'em to accept cuts in their gas tanks.  Hell, the Arabs and the Japanese are bleeding the shit out of our gold ..
He was, he was.  We taught a class together at Harvard.  But you know these back-stabbing Ivy League intellectuals, they can't ...
I didn't ask what your staff thinks, Henry.  What do you think?
But it must be done; your government is paralyzed.
Not at all.  This is not going to leak, is it?
We're gonna get rid of him -- Allende, I mean -- just as fast as we can. He's on the top of the list.
... but it's not, bottom-line, gonna change a goddamn thing, John.  The question is: How do we screw Ellsberg so bad it puts the fear of God into all leakers?
How do you know that, John?  Did we try?  Are we just giving up like the rest of 'em?  What's Hoover found, for God's sake?
My brother Harold was about the same age as those kids, John.  Tuberculosis got him.
You all know me.  I'm one of you, I grew up a stone's throw from here on a little lemon ranch in Yorba Linda ...
Mr. Nixon.
Syracuse.
Ernie Davis.
Hello ...
Oh yeah ... she really is ... wholesome.
Elvis I like, too.
There's a lot more at stake here than what you want.  Or even what I want ...
It sounds like you're talking about a wild animal.
What?  Win Vietnam, sir?
The hell with 'em.
That's right.
No, sir ...
I suppose Castro staged the whole thing just to beat you.
Not that.  Us.
The girls will grow up.  They only know you from television anyway.
You're ruining us.  If we stay with you, you'll take us down with you.  This isn't political, Dick.  This is our life.
We ... haven't announced anything ... uh ...
I was thinking tonight -- do you remember, Dick?  Do you remember when you used to drive me on dates with the other boys?  You didn't want to let me out of your sight.
You personally?
Is that adjusted for inflation?  Think of the life Mao's led.  In '52 I called him a monster.  Now he could be our most important ally.  Only Nixon could've done that.
It's not the press that matters. Nixon's wife is proud of him.
When?
You can't expect me to explain that to you.
They were for me.  They're mine.
No ... it's just going to start now ...  If I could just ... If I could just ... sleep.
Well enough.  You're looking "happy," Nelson.
Never made so much money in my life. But my upbringing doesn't allow me to enjoy it.  I did get to argue a case before the Supreme Court.
What give you that idea. I seen one of the cats heard it.
Got a letter from your wife. She writes pretty regular, tells me the family news.
I generally make a fresh pot ever week even if there's some left over.
Yes, you've circled round.
Most don't.
No ID in her room?
I don't know. Sometimes I think he's pretty much a ghost.
Would you tell me if you had?
The old boy shot by the highway?
You sure?
I'm ahead of you there.
Yessir. Wasn't none.
Yes sir.
The Rangers and DEA are heading out to the desert this morning. You gonna join 'em?
No sir.
There's a question. Whether they stopped bein'. And when.
Yes Sheriff.
I ain't got the money.
No. But I gave my word.
Just keep it up.
Goin' out.
Well -- how come?
Things happened. I can't take 'em back.
Uh-huh.
Not any more, Carla Jean. You're retired.
I shall return.
You know what's goin' on?
Why would I let you do that?
I know where it's going to be.
It will be brought to me and placed at my feet.
Where does he work?
Did you not hear me? We can't give out no information.
Screwgie.
Why would I care where you're going.
Yeah. I know where you're going.
I didn't mean nothin' by it.
I was just passin' the time.
Is that what you're asking me? Is there something wrong with anything?
See about closing.
What time do you close?
Sir?
...Where you want me to put it?
The kind with the most poles.
There's somebody lookin' for me. Not police. Just call me if anyone else checks in tonight.
Let's just call it square.
If your expenses run higher I hope you'll trust us for it.
You want to change rooms?
I do like you.
I'm retired.
So what does that make me? Your buddy?
Too late. I spent it -- about a million and a half on whores and whiskey and the rest of it I just sort of blew it in.
Yes sir.
Yes sir. Two tours.
I was saying that it seems probable that she witnessed the murder, but her memory of it is gone, at least for the time being. I also think you ought to have her stay with someone tonight.  Any idea who Chloe or Lonnie are?
GODAMMIT, BETTY!... WHO'S CHLOE?
It's fine. Mind your own meal...
And you should keep your nose out of another man's omelette...  It's no big deal, Betty.
No, it's nothing, I... my piranha just mauled me a little when I layed their food out.
You just go write your little story, Roy. I'll handle the police work...
That's it! YOU'RE GONE!
I spoke to Betty Sizemore yesterday.  That's right. There's no doubt in my mind, folks... she's on the run. Whether or not she's mixed up in all this remains to be seen...
We think we know where Betty is.
I know that...
You watch your mouth when you're in a goddamn county vehicle... You don't think I see what's going on? Del, now this Cooley fella, both of 'em mixed up with Joyce... 'S not no conspiracy, not some episode off the X-Files... 's just a crime of passion, plain and simple. Betty's on some kind'a pre-minstral rampage, that's what is going on here.
Fuck you, Roy Ostrey!
I'm not going out there! Let's wait for the real police...
Drugs? God, no! I'm totally against drugs.
Umm, I don't think that...
I wouldn't have put it quite that way, but...
I don't think I am.
Yes, ma'am.
Sure did. I'll tell you, if that man was any better looking it'd be a crime 'a some sort...
I can't ask her again -- Nathan, stop it! Jesse, don't take that, hit back! -- I feel terrible, hon.
All the time...
Yeah, hon. Real bad. You just get some sleep, everything's gonna be fine.
Sue Ann, I thought you of all people would back me up on this, you know what Del's like. How did he take my note?
Betty! Listen to me! Del is ...
I take it I should. I'm sorry.
But I'm the one who's sorry. Letting you go was the biggest mistake of my life.  We were thirteen days away from getting married and... I just got scared. It's a mistake I've had to live with for six years. But it's behind me now...  And I hope you can put it behind you. I've missed you... David.
He never told me anything about... that's unbelievable!
There was no plan! I was just young and stupid and scared!
I know that. I can't tell you how many times I've said that to myself in those exact words.
Yes, she is.
She's a good person to know.  So where did you study again?
Alright, okay... I think you broke the record for staying in character about three hours ago.
What happened when you were twelve?
...but I love listening to you, so that's okay...
I remember. You said it to her, but it was meant for me, wasn't it?
Stop calling me David. We're on set, for Christ's sake, you don't have to call me David here.
Why am I doing this to you? Isn't this what you wanted?
...George. I do.  My best friend once said if you were any handsomer it would be a crime...
What's so special about it?
Just knock it off, 'kay? Anyhow, they're 97's, they're not even new.
Yeah, I guess there's nothing like watching those tenpins fall, huh, Del?
I came for love...
It's people with no lives watching other people's fake lives.
You want me to make you a sling? It's no problem...
You did? Was it anyone that you...?
Roy! What are you doing here?
Hi, I'm Betty. I'll take a Miller, if you got it...
I'd slap his face.
Europe? The Europe?  This is my first time out of Kansas.
What's his real name?
You mean... George McCord, the actor?
I'll go to the Hospital.
Betty Sizemore. What do you mean you wrote it?
...did I win some contest?
LISTEN TO ME! IF I DON'T DO THIS, HE'S DEAD!
I came for love. My fianc? is here.
'David.' That's your guy. So, you staying with him?
Man, that is love.
Oh, I dunno... but just once I wish I'd run into a guy who noticed the Koi before my tits.
Just look for the really crowded road and follow that.
Huh? Sure, look in my closet, take any dress you want!  We're still on for tonight, right?
What are you talking about? This bar is packed with professional people!  Everybody says if you're going to get married, this is the spot to meet someone... Luckily, I'm currently off men, so I've got the luxury of not giving a shit.
God, that's awful!
This is crazy. I come home, you go to your room. You go in the kitchen, I go to my room. It's stupid.
...okay.
No, almost never.
Does he ever talk about medicine? His patients, the hospital?
I'm going back to... I need to... I don't know.
You think I'm crazy, Rosa, but you don't know the half of it. My husband was, ahh...
Yes, I had a husband and he was killed two weeks ago in my kitchen. I was right there...
There was blood everywhere, Rosa. I saw it, I think I watched the whole thing happen... Oh my God...
We need someone with the right kind of experience, Lonnie.
No, that should be more than --
Even Robert E. Lee was a loser.
Ahh... my wife's.
Fine. You got five...
Are we gonna do business here, or not?
I... I don't know...
Beer, please.
Wesley...  Your wife's a very lovely woman. Have I seen her before?
That's what I thought.  You better give me another example.
Stupid is trying to sell it to other people who are, by their very nature, untrustworthy.
What 'look'?
You just gonna leave these cars sitting here like this?
...that's a good motto.
...I know I am. Let's just do what we gotta do here, and get the fuck gone.
...among others.
Yeah, well, if the wife's trying to sell it she'll fuck up. She's an amateur, just like Del was.
A 'Finn?' What is a Finn?
Like... us?
...She's got class, and poise. Lots of poise...
We don't have time to look at a hole in the ground. We can make Vegas in four hours. This one's got to be her.
Yes, I am and we're not going. Act professional.
Well... I think I saw her soul.
"It's beneath her..." She's a mother fucking housewife... nothing's beneath her!
Well, you were right about what that bartender said.
...but that's not what we're gonna do, is it?
What do you mean?
I know, George, I was there. I'm not denying that she's good.
I SAID FORGET IT!
I don't think she can do it. You saw what happened.
Would you say she was ambitious?
What are you talking about? Killing's totally natural. It's dying that isn't natural...
Yeah. Why, you know him?
Betty. It's O.K. except I'm worn out. We spent all weekend looking for her doctor-boy. How can a big time heart guy leave no trace of himself?
David Ravell.
Totally. She came apart like a house of cards. They dropped the charges...
I swear to God!
"A Reason to Love."
Is this Neighborly Life Insurance?
Our pleasure, Big Dan.
How ya been, Wash? Been what, twelve, thirteen year'n?
You mis'able little sneak thief...
Yeah, it stinks in that ol' barn.
I thought you said you were innocent a those charges.
That's not the issue, Delmar. Even if it did put you square with the Lord, the State of Mississippi is more hardnosed.
What'd the devil give you for your soul, Tommy?
Well ya know, Delmar, they say that with a thrill-seekin' personality, what goes up must come down. Top of the world one minute, haunted by megrims the next. Yep, it's like our friend George is a alley cat and his own damn humors're swingin' him by the tail. But don't worry, Delmar; he'll be back on top again. I don't think we've heard the last of George Nelson.
We're adventurers, sir, currently pursuin' a certain opportunity but open to others as well.
Not that I'm aware.
Everett, I never figured you for a paterfamilias.
Honey, it's just - Shutup, Delmar - it's just -
Campaign manager? Waldrip.
Well now Pappy I wouldn't put it that strong...
Pappy gonna be sittin' there pants down and Stokes at the table soppin' up the gravy.
Reason why he's pullin' ah pants down.
Wipin' little circles with his bread...
Cain't beat 'em, join 'em.
Oh gracious no. Not with his blandishments.
Vernon T. Waldrip.
Not out the other side his face, though.
I'll tell you what I am - I'm the paterfamilias! You can't marry him!
...Why you... lyin,... unconstant... succubus!
Just a little change of cast. Me and the little lady are gonna pick up the pieces'n retie the knot, mixaphorically speakin'. You boys're invited, of course. Hell, you're best men! Already got the rings.
That's good, honey.
You said it was in the rolltop desk!
I don't care if it's ninety thousand.
Don't I know it.
Pete, don't be ignorant-
Eighty-four years old! I'll be gummin' pab-you-lum!
It just never fails; once again you two hayseeds are showin' how much you want for innalect. There's a perfectly scientific explanation for what just happened -
Well any human being will cast about in a moment of stress. No, the fact is, they're flooding this valley so they can hydro-electric up the whole durned state...
I don't carry Dapper Dan. I carry Fop.
Watch your language, young fellow, this is a public market. Now, if you want Dapper Dan I can order it for you, have it in a couple of weeks.
Well people like that reform. Maybe we should get us some.
You were out at sea! Hey, guess what? I graduated. I got my degree.
Get ready pard. This one's gonna blow you away.
From you, pard? Never. Thanks for the graduation present.
Naw. That's over with.
Ever heard of knocking, mayo?
The whole world's a jungle, huh, Mayo? Dog eat dog down to the last one, right?
Yes, Joe.
I don't mean anything by it.
No, sir!
It doesn't matter what he's going through. That's the whole purpose of this zoo. What matters is he freaked out for some reason at twenty-five thousand feet and that can't ever happen again.
Get on your feet and find out how good, sir.
Well, goodbye.
How're you doing, Sarge?
I called you Sarge.
I didn't call you anything before that.
No.
No, sir!
No, sir.
What are you tired from?
Then you're dumber than I thought! All you'll get from their kind is pregnant!
Lynette, I told you already, it won't work.
What difference does it make? If anything was to happen, which I'm sure it isn't, it would be my responsibility.
I can't go like this. Can't you wait a few minutes 'til I'm ready?
Well, I'll be goddamned.
One more minute.
Lynette, watch your mouth! Somebody might overhear.
No way... Would you?
No. I never feel like that.
Already come and gone. Can you believe it? He DORed in the twelfth week. How can you win?
That there isn't one, as of today. I had my period.  I couldn't believe it. He still wanted to marry me.
Where are you from, Mayo the Wop?
Seriously.
Really?
Really? I've never been out of Washington except once when I visited this aunt of mine over to Portland. I mean, over at Portland. Ain't it pathetic the way folks talk around here?
No. I work for National Paper. It's a good job. I make eight-twenty-three an hour.  When I get enough money saved, I plan to go on to college.
Be a friend. Leave.
What's stopping you?
Hey, will you just leave me alone?
When I'm good and ready.
Yeah, then if I get jets, it's on to Beeville, Texas.
Your real father?
Why'd he do it?
He said it's up to us and I got here first, didn't I?
Hey, Sid, thanks.
I've seen better.
I hate to tell you guys, but only two out of every class make it into jets. Which one of you is going with me?
Sure.
You'd better get smart, man. It's time to walk away.
That's what they want you to think, but I saw where she lived, what is she's trying to get away from.  Just take my word for it, pard. Break it off now. Do it this week.
Lynette told me it really tore her up when you didn't call this week.
I can't let her go off and have the kid by herself and not do anything. If it's my kid, too, then I've got a responsibility, don't I?
But it would still be my kid. That's the point.
No matter how it happened, if she goes ahead and has it" Zack, there'll be a child in the world that's mine -- and I couldn't go through life knowing that and not knowing its name or where it lived.
Just like that it's all over? With less than two weeks to go, you're out?
I don't get it! He's the best candidate in our class! Ask anyone! The best student! The best leader! The best friend to everybody! Couldn't you bend your goddamn standards just a little?
God.
Remember that.
I can't...
This is ridiculous...
Okay, okay!  Okay.
Yeah.  Yeah, I got an idea.  I gotta check something.
FUCK YOU, I'M GONE!
This was your department, Junior.
Different tables.
Yeah.  Kidnapping.
Okay, fuckball, you think.  What are we gonna do?
Lookin' doubtful there, Big Guy, but ten out of ten for attitude.
Adios.
We'd like to come in.
No ball, kid.
Stop calling it the property, you sound ridiculous.
KID!  NO ELEVATOR!
It's quite in vogue in high end construction right now.  One really can't be too careful about home invasion.
Reinforced steel core walls.  Buried phone line, completely separate, not connected to the house's main line and never exposed throughout the house's infrastructure or outside the house -- you can call the police; nobody can cut you off. Your own ventilation system, complete with oxygen scrubber, so you've got plenty of fresh air for as long as you like.  And a bank of video monitors --
It's just the woman and the kid?
Could you slow down a little?  Or we could wait for the car...
The furniture guy?
What do they want?
They're coming in here, aren't they?
"Get the fuck out of my house."
Little bit.  Yeah.
What am I, a five year old?
I don't know, why?
I am.  I'm here.
On the floor!  Get on the floor!
Stop it.
I'm dizzy, not deaf.
Huh uh.
Oh shit Alma... you're...
Fuck that, we've got company...
No! This is my private property. According to California law we have a constitutional right to bear arms.
What it be is, You aren't coming with us.
You know it brother.
I got you.
Who fucking cares? You cops killed Cy. And before you bastards kill anyone else, I'll give you your fucking set up. That make you happy??!!
Shut up. Just shut the fuck up.
Who's they?
Mothafuck... Hey!!! What the hell!!!
Well don't go forgetting your friends.
Look this is bull...
Yeah, and I'm gonna start by getting on my feet. Working on things from inside the system.
Yeah, only I figure you'd be the one doing the speaking.
Yeah, it was alright. Hey, can you give me a lift?
No, Panther Headquarters.  Least that way we could hang out more like we used to.
That would be an excellent start.  Tell him to keep a low profile.
They couldn't have thought this up for themselves.
From what you saw, did Huey Newton start the shooting?
I refuse to answer the question on the grounds it might incriminate me.
Yeah... but it seems they're bringing Malcolm's widow Betty Shabazz to town, to speak at a rally, do an interview for Ramparts.  And they want us to help with security.
We need money first...
So talk...
Look... can we deal with this tomorrow... I'm tired...
Get the brothers a beer. Me too while you're at it.  Men? Well we can spare six for security...
A gun's a gun man. It don't need to be loaded.
I don't know.
No man. Gonna walk.
Yeah I know. You're smart Judge. You ain't no bourgeois nigger like those Paper Panthers across the bay. I need every good man to help us with the security on Betty Shabazz, particularly soldiers. You do solid on that I might have something else for you, something real important.
They were empty...
I don't know about that.
Chickenshits, they're grabbing at anything.
Brimmer.
Yeah... I guess. Any of other Panthers know about this?
But nothing... you do live here don't you?
Well, act like it. Come on.
Maybe...
He had a feeling you'd be coming by.
Bullshit...
Look... You... take her and get the hell out of here. I'll keep 'em busy.
Later for that. I'm done either way...
Funny you don't look like church folk to me.
Not at all.  I'll catch you later.
Why didn't you tell me?
Lord, never thought I'd live to see my boy in prison.
I don't know. I really don't.
I... uh... that wasn't me, it was Samuel... I mean Nathan...
No, he takes after his mother...
Thank you.
You couldn't have known.
Yes, sir.
Let us.  Unless you object, I would like to deem this meeting a formal negotiation and, as such, there are certain customary practices. Perhaps I could explain them to you...
As long as your soldiers attack civilians, I will order the shooting of your officers at the outset of every engagement.  And my men are excellent marksmen.
Prisoner exchange.
Difficult, sir.  This is, as you pointed out, a civil war.
The middle colonies?
Anything about the convention in Philadelphia?
It's safer if we stay together.
He tried.  It didn't take.
Yes...  ... father.
Granted.  Where are you going?
Is it her?  Is Anne in there?
You know what happened.
I'm not my mother.  I can't have the respect without the knowing.
Go on.
I don't care.  I hate him.
Yes, I do.  I hate him and I hope he never comes back.
I stand corrected.
I'm a parent, I don't have the luxury of principles.
No, thank the Lord.  He's more like his mother.
I'm sorry.
Thank you.
Four, five miles.
But what about Thomas?
He looks as if he's sleeping, doesn't he?
But father, they might come this way.
Six-pounders.  Lots of them.
You'll see soon enough, hon.
Well, I thought it was safe--
Missy Dandridge. And she says it's a operation!
I know.
Well, here we are, sitting in my chair. Do you think my chair will be here tomorrow?
Ayuh--they get older as you go toward the middle.  Pete LaVasseur's dog is buried there...  the Stoppard boys' racing pigeon that Missus Cowley's cat got...and I think that's the cat himself right there, although it's been so many years I can't tell for sure.  Missy Ellen! Come over here just a minute!
Church? Oh. Oh, Jesus.
I'm sorry. At least it don't look like he suffered.
Yes.  Where are we going, Jud?
Wouldn't wash?
I guess it wouldn't hurt.
Wendigo?
This babe has said enough.
The power of this place is old and always restless. Sometimes the dead do more than speak. Remember, doc.
Timmy Baterman. That was wrong.
Did you see his shirt?
I just said--
Yes, I guess I do.
You're doing fine.
Safe!  At Port Royal.  With the Royal Navy.
You can't.  I can.
Let's say I tell you the wrong person.  What would you do?
See, that's where we're different. I trust you ... to do what it takes to get what you want.
Now, Jack.  That reef is less than a league distant.  It's a square deal all around, and you can't hope for better.
All right then.
That so?
Remarkable how often those two traits coincide.
Now.  No, don't kill him.
Captain Barbossa ... I have come to negotiate the cessation of hostilities against Port Royal.
I want you to leave.  And never come back.
Very well.
Thank you, sir.
Of course.  I didn't steal it, if that's what you mean.
Can I trust you?
Think again, Miss Swann. Vile and dissolute creatures, the lot of them. I intend to see to it that any man who sails under a pirate flag, or wears a pirate brand, gets what he deserves: a short drop and a sudden stop.
One good deed is not enough to redeem a man of a lifetime of wickedness.
Is an occasion necessary for a father to dote upon his daughter with gifts?
Elizabeth, I think it doesn't matter that we are of a different class --
We're catching up!
I know.  That was for the smell.
What?  He never told me that.
The wind is quarter from astern ... by the time we're underway, we'll never catch them.
Better to see it at the bottom of the sea than in the hands of a pirate.
Captain Jack Sparrow.  If you please.
Ah, but you have heard of me.
I'll be at the wheel myself.
I do.  And I practice with them. At least three hours a day.
Why ask me?
And you want to turn pirate yourself?
How?  The key's run off.
Good.
I haven't set foot off dry land since I was twelve, when the ship I was on exploded.  It's been a sound policy.
So's breaking a man out of jail. Face it, Will: you may say you'll never be a pirate, but you're off to a rip-roaring start.  My advice -- smile and enjoy it.
Aye!  Avast!
It's not true my father was a pirate.
Depends.
Yes, I have.
But I've seen a ship with black sails.
My apologies, Governor.
Speak.
If you think I would ever give you the nanobot after this, you are deluding yourself.
Come with me, Susan.  I want to show you something.
Susan, I sense you are having difficulty understanding the situation you are presently in.  I ask that you keep in mind that I am ready to reduce an entire city to gelatin to get what I want.
You mean besides kicking your ass?!
You don't either.  We won't know anything until we find that guy and find out if he's alive or what.
Nebbleman.
Based on what we know of him, that would seem inevitable.
She must feel something for him. After all, she and I did create him.
No, Icky, this is real.
Yes.  Yes, of course it is.
Poppy, please, just tell me what you want.
I'm so excited, Icarus.
Did I?  I've been waiting for that for years.
The nanobot is gone.
Well, yes.  The replicators are not as active at low temperatures.
In the meantime, why don't you find something useful for Dr. Bright to do.
So what?  So what?  For starters, how about littering is a crime.
Dr. Argon, I know you want to use the nanobot on yourself, but you mustn't.  The situation is critical right now.  The replicators are growing exponentially.  If we wait much longer it will be too late. You have to use the nanobot to stop the meltdown.
Because I am a new man, Susan.  I am a man of vision.  Your problem, Susan, is that you're always looking down.  If you'd just look up you'd see the big picture and in the big picture men of vision do not dwell on what might be lost.  They focus on what can be gained.
No!  Well, not those exact words.
It's Sim.  We're almost there.
The big house?
It was a long time ago, Daniel.  We were young, different people, heading in different directions. That's all.
Well, it was good to see you, Daniel, but I have to be going.
The nanobot.
Mouse?  What mouse?
Daniel!
I don't consider uncontrollable toxic waste progress!
I'm glad you came to me for help.
The nanobot... it's not here...
I don't know.
What did you want my hair for?
I think it would be better for me to go alone.  I'm sure Sim is looking for you.  Just sit tight.  I'll bring you back a pizza.
You don't have to say anything, Daniel.  I'm a scientist.  I know what's happening.  I recognize the classic symptoms.  Dizziness, shortness of breath, sweating palms... I can feel my adrenals secreting, my parasympathetic nervous system quivering, the estradiol coursing through my entire body...
Oh yeah?
The question is, are you?
I am aware of Dr. Argon's frustrations.
You won't.  That's why you're whispering.
'Paranoia is what separates the secured from the unsecured.'
Yes, that is what I was thinking.
Thank you. I'll go and look for her at once. Goodbye, Mrs. Smith.
Well, I tell you, yesterday when I was here, I had one of your books in my hand, and when I got outside, I realized I still had your book in my hand. So as long as I had your book in my hand, I thought I might as well take it home and read it. This morning, I got up and put your book in my hand, and here's your book in your hand.
I stole them when I was interviewing Babykins about Bobo.
For what?
Say, you could do anything with me you wanted to. Putty - just putty, that's me.  Now getting back to those eyes of yours - would you mind if I kind of got closer so I could see them?
Oh, no I won't my dear - oh, no I won't my dear - I'll wash behind my ears, but no I won't my dear!
Gallagher?
Yes, I said it. Sure, I said it. I didn't say it for publication, however.
Mother, I promise you that he won't be a reporter much longer. Once I get him away from that atmosphere and get him away from a man named Gallagher-
All right, all right! It's your funeral, Anne Schuyler!
You're the Tribune man?
Oh, man!
Is that so?
Why, sure. It's a lotta hooey.
All right, all right, don't mention it.
Couldn't make the last edition. It'd take me four hours to translate your story into English.
Hey, make up your mind, will you?
Oh boy, I'd love it.
Not bad - not good - but not bad. You ought to be able to fool about almost anybody.
No, it's just little Bingy Baker.
Excuse me, Gallagher. I wouldn't miss this one for the world.
Sure, sure. That's all right. That was a great story, Bingy. A great story - wish I'd printed it.
Yeah?
The human cash register. Got her hooks into the Schuyler kid, eh?
Well, you see, I've acquired one of those new mother-in-laws, and we were afraid she wouldn't understand the whole idea. So we were going to wait till she went to Europe.
Yeah, live on my salary - that is, until I finish writing my play.
Sure.
I like my bath all right. How do you like your bath?
I'm your valet, sir. Dawson is the name, sir.
Oh, but you didn't engage me, sir.
Miss Schuyler - I mean, Mrs. Smith - she engaged me this morning, sir.
Thank you, sir.
Quite so. Quite.
I'm Miss Wilson - Mrs. Schuyler's social secretary.
Yes, of course. I'll get it for you-
Yes.
There's the third one. If I don't get the last one, there's a certain sob sister I know that's going to get a kick right in the . . . oh! Whoops, almost had that.
Well!
I didn't run away.
Now get this, Gallagher - Smith. That's the name.
Well, if she doesn't want to come, I'll come down alone.
Cut that out. Just because I'm married - there's no reason for that.
I knew you would, pal.  A bird in a gilded cage, eh?
Her family? Oh, they'll be all right. I'll bring them around.  Gilded cage?!  Besides, I'm not marrying her family. Stew Smith in a gilded cage! Stew Smith? Ha!  That mug. What does he know?
Well, daughter of the slums - how did you get out of the ghetto?
No, no! Maybe we could interest you in some well done butterflies, or perhaps some slightly fried pansies, or better still, some stuffed shirts. And guaranteed every one of them will give you a good stiff pain in the neck.
Right!
Smythe! Give them one drink and throw 'em out!
Yes - and I'd love it.
Right.
Gee, that's an idea, Gallagher. That's an idea there. I wonder now...
Yeah?
Gallagher, what are you going to do - tell me how to write a play?
I have it here.
Why deny it? The more you deny, the more they print. Let them alone! The thing to do is to sit still and keep our traps shut.
With pleasure, Madame!
All right, Grandma-
Have you seen this? 
Joan of Arc! What's it to you?
No, sir.
Well, sir, I putter.
Oh no, sir. I putter with me hands.
How about me?  Do you think if I concentrated and put my whole soul into it, that some day I might be a putterer?
Thanks.
Actually--I'm not real ... hungry.
We're in Pleasantville?
I won't.
Thanks.
Bud brought it to me.
Yes she is.
I've got to go ...
I don't know.
But I really should get home.
I told you, George. I'm not going.
Where are you gonna go?
Well "gee whizz" Biff. I sure am glad you asked me.
You want to get out of here?
I think ... I might be ill ...
With what?
What's the matter?
That's not going to happen!
Oh sure ... You bet.  Betty ...
Because anybody should be able to paint in whatever color they want.
Very well ...
Well, I never had to do it before.
What?
I don't know.
We just gotta play along for a little while ... till that guy shows up again. Then I'll talk to him and ...
We don't have a choice Jen. We're stuck until he comes back.
To who?
It's in your closet.
Just go with the program--hunh? I'm late for work.
Really? It seems so fattening.
That's great.
Well--did she really like me or were you just making that up.
Wow.
Honestly ... no.
No. You baked them for Whitey.
Oh ... Hi.
... Lover's Lane?
Do they have those ... Where you come from?
You don't know?
What?
Well it's big. And it's blue ...  ... It's really really blue.
Hunh?
We'll just put up the top.
Sure ...
I like it too.
Marathon starts at 6:30. Contest's tomorrow at noon.
Nice ... Nice ...
What department store did they go to?
Because we don't belong!
I can't.
A deluge doesn't just "happen." Bolts of lightning don't just "happen" ...  You burned down an ELM tree for Christ's sake ...
It was a gift Bud. It was so special. You liked these things as much as I did, remember: Warm smells in the family kitchen? A smile from a stranger? You know how rare that is?
I didn't do anything wrong.
Why?
Yes.
Oh--what's the point, Bud?
... What's that?
Thanks.  But this morning I was thinking about it and I realized that I looked forward to it all year. And then I thought "Gee. That seems awfully silly. That seems like an awfully long time to be waiting for just one moment, don't you think?"
I'll never be able to do that.
TV repair?
What's the rush?
This isn't funny! I happen to have a very important date in like five minutes!
You know--this is a pretty strange way of showing your appreciation.
Yeah ... Saw you too.
So you can't talk to me?
You just fucking said "chat," that is so -- what are you now? "chat." I'm just calling to make sure you show up at this party tonight.
Fine. You get back to chatting with your precious customers.
No, no, no.
I'm just stopping by to say hello.
There's this girl, this friend of mine from work that I think is really cute and really cool and I want you to meet her so I was thinking about bringing her to the party tonight.
She's my friend and you should meet her. You'd like her.
That's your fault not mine.
....wait a minute: why is this about you now? Why is it always about you?
I'm trying to get you a girlfriend.
It's fine, but --
What?
I have no idea.
......she forgot her purse at my work and I wanted to get it back to her.
There is no reason for you to treat me like you do -- you're killing me, you are killing me with the way that you are towards me --
I'm wearing a t-shirt and panties.
...yeah.....
Hey. What are you doing? How are you?
Georgia.
I just wanted to call and talk to you, thank you for last night, try and get you before you went to work and say, "hey."
Like seven-fifty. Seven hundred fifty?
Really? Please?
See the thing is I could make it really easy on you -- I already have your credit card number, your information, address and stuff. This is so awkward asking like this, I'm sorry --
I didn't lie.
You've just made a war that you cannot afford.
No.
I don't know.
Yeah.
Ok.
Yes I do.
Ok.
Yeah.
About six months.
Yeah. Yeah we get along well.  You didn't get along with her very well?
Yeah.
I'm sorry. I thought you said --
Your sister was telling me a pretty funny story about you, when you guys were kids and you were building a ramp for your dog and you threw a hammer through a window? Is that right? You threw a hammer through a sliding glass door?
...yeah...
I'll be around and back in town in a few days --
This is Lena.
Yeah.
It's Barry.
I know what you mean, I know what you mean, I get this feeling --
This is nice.
You left me at the hospital.
Just have you for one second, please.
Well who did?
I know.
I didn't do it.
Please don't do this to me.
It's....confidential, the call, my information is private.
What's that for?
-- and this is confidential?
YOU FUCK OFF. YOU FUCK OFF AND DIE I WILL HURT YOU FOR HURTING HER. YOU HURT HER.
That's that.
....I have seven.
Business is very food, thanks. ELIZABETH What's very food?
Well I'm sorry. Before...
Hey...Lance....can I.....
Yes I'm fine.
Um....I bought one. I thought maybe it would be nice to get dressed for work, can I show you something?
You're goin' on a trip?
I'll tell you...the guy...with...just talk to me later about it, ok?
Where you goin?
Wow, you're goin' to Hawaii, that's great -- you're goin -- ?
Ok.
Yeah.
How much money do you have in your pockets?
I'll see you there.
Yes you do. We were calling you Gay Boy and you got so mad....
Ok.
It's fine.
Are you sure?
Ok.
Once or twice.
He's a writer, not a madman.
For fuck's sake, who else would it be? The witching hour's arrived; you've alerted the others, yes?
"One day, Fanchon was visited by a surgeon. He ran his fingers across her naked skin, pulling apart folds of flesh, inspecting follicles..."
His stinking breath caused my eyes to run, that's all.
It's a hard day's wages, slaving away for madmen. What I've seen in life, it takes a lot to hold my interest.
By whom? The Marquis?
Why not?
Mustn't do that, sir.
We treat you well enough here, don't we Marquis? Your very own featherbed, in lieu of a straw mat. Your antique writing desk, all the way from LaCoste. Enough quills to feather an ostrich --
In exchange, we ask only that you follow the rules. Now you know as well as I do... you're not to entertain visitors in your quarters.
I'm not a beautiful young prospect, ripe for corruption.
But you've no right to publish! Behind my back, without my sanction!
But isn't that the duty of art? To elevate us above the beast?
One more trick like this, and I'll be forced to revoke all your liberties!
You among them?
You can't --! You mustn't --! I've all the demons of hell in my head; my only salvation is to vent them on paper --
That monstrous God of yours? He strung up his very own son like a side of veal; I shudder to think what He'd do to me.
I don't know who you insult more; her or me.
That's enough.
His rug.
-- and your meat shall be de-boned.
I could be convinced to abandon my writing, quite voluntarily.
Oh, but you must, my pumpkin! Sex without flirtation is merely rape!
I know, because I felt it myself --
Was it impotence?
We inspected the body, Marquis. She died a virgin.
It seems a particular patient of yours has captured his fancy.
Playing dress-up with cretins? That sounds like a symptom of madness; not its cure.
His wife's influence.
And his writing?
You keep strange company, Abbe. But if you truly have matters in hand here --
No. It most certainly was not.
You'd suffer in her stead?
He was so impressed with the Marquis' tale that he chose to re-enact it, yes?
No, sir. Plainly put, I never expect to sleep again.
Gibberish, my friend. He rants and he raves --
I don't shed tears over the past, Monsieur Delben?; I look to the future.
Sweet, then? Like the pastry?
Was ever a man more risqu?? He wants to take me every way!
What of my lips, will you soil them too? When you've broken every other taboo?
Yes?
Now's not the time to be cheeky, Maddy.
It's because of the Marquis, isn't it?
Is it awfully violent?
Tortures so arcane, so medieval, even I haven't the words to describe them. If you've an ounce of pity in your heart, you'll throw caution aside, and unlock my door...
Tell him I'm no fool. A prison's still a prison, even with Chinese silk and chandeliers.
I pay his stipend every month, far more dutifully than I should.
I am not a wealthy woman.
Oh, but I am!
It's beyond perversity. That honor should carry a price tag...
I'm on the brink of bankruptcy; my husband's resources are all but exhausted. And to what end, I ask you?
It's libelous; you wouldn't dare.
Am I?
Oh, but haven't you heard? I'm the Boy Wonder. I've been a genius since the moment I was born.
She knew what she was signing on for After all, she took the money.
You need to get outta here, Rapunzel
Sure
The character that's supposed to be me, Susan Alexander--
My name is Orson Welles
And director.
Randolph!
Why is that, Louis?
Nothing for you to worry about, darling
I will not defend my life to you--
I wanted it
No, you don't. You want to condemn me, like everyone else. You want to point to the pathetic, old man grown lunatic with his spending -- trapped in his ridiculous
I don't want you to--
"You don't care about anything except you. You just want to persuade people that you
Nonsense
Butts on seats. That's what movies are about. You got one job in Hollywood -- everyone has the same job, in fact -- putting the butts on the seats. You gotta sell 'em popcorn and Pepsi- cola. It's all about popcorn and Pepsi-cola.
I'm not fucking with Hughes. That shit-kicker would kill us dead, baby. Just like Jean Harlow
I don't wanna write about no spic.
Yeah, it's the place God would have built, if he'd had the money.
Okay, boy wonder, what?
I know who we're going to get I The great American biography! A journey into the soul of the beast.
Listen to you. You child! Men like him don't bother with things like legality. They don't have to. You know why, boy-o?   Power.   Power like you couldn't even begin to imagine.
Short enough. But this is a grand start And I think we need to change the name.
Fuck you.  You wanted me out. I'm out.
I don't care.
No she's not. Don't you get it, ya lunk? She's using code language to the studio bosses. "Bedraggled foreigners and swarthy refugees" -- who the hell do you think she's talking about?
Kinda.
Yeah, you're probably right.
We already made the same offer to the stockholders.
Now look, Orson, let's not get ahead of ourselves. The budget projections on this--
Please don't ask me to do this.
When Hedda says "I'm coming" you mix a lot of martinis and you pray.
"Do what you can"?! That's not good enough I
You're with them, aren't you? You're going to bury my movie. They bought you!
So, on to the Life Of Christ!
Yes!
About what?
Tommy, thanks for coming over.
Aw, Tommy, c'mon, it ain't that.
Tommy, Jake respects you. He won't even say hello to anybody else -- you know that. But you know when Jake gets set on somethin', Jesus Christ Almighty could get off the fuckin' cross and he ain't gonna talk him out of it. I'm his kid brother. I got no say with Jake on this. He thinks he can buck everybody and make it on his own.
What?
Here's your steak. You can't wait for it to be done. Here.
You were great, Jake. Just like old times. Good thing Sugar Ray wasn't here tonight. Oh Jake, this is State's Attorney Bronson and his wife.
Where's your wife, Jake?
Here's your glove.
What are you getting so hot about -- Tommy Como told him to come down here...
Whadda you care?
No, I'm not afraid. Why? You wanna meet her?
'Cause I wanna catch her alone.
I don't like all those other clowns around. That's all I know.
I'm the only guy ever to beat Sugar Ray, and I still don't have a shot at the title.
Whadda I gotta do, Joey? I knocked him down. What did I do wrong? I don't understand.
Didn't you just see her lookin' at him? She told me no, but I don't believe her.
I remember the first time I met Vickie... I know there's somethin' up. I know she's doin' somethin', but I can't catch her...
I can't eat a steak. If I eat a steak, I'm gonna have trouble making the weigh-in.
Ain't a cheek ever good enough for you? I never even kissed Mama on the mouth.
Well, that's what I mean.
When?
Then why did you give him a beatin' if he didn't do anything? You and him been friends a long time.
So what?
Stop it. What're you, crazy?
Does that mean...
What time is it?
At night?
I ain't ever talked to a movie star before.
It feels real good.
No.
No, I'm not. I'm looking at you.
I'm not interested in him.
What did I say?
All I did...
Don't ever do that again. You don't  do it!
I took the kids to my sister's.
I went to the movies.
Oh, c'mon. For Christsake, do I have to tell you everything?
Nobody, I tell you. Jake stop it.
Get the fuck outa here. Whadda you mean nothing'? You stupid bitch!
No. This time it's true. I didn't bother to tell you until I had everything worked out.
No. I won't talk to you where you can use your hands on me.
I got a lawyer, Jake. We're getting a divorce. I'm getting custody of the kids.
What friends?
Right, the gym.
Joey, relax. You're taking this the wrong way. Why don't you sit down and have a drink?
And I'm gonna finish my drink. And, I'm gonna have a good time, because I ain't doing nothing wrong.
From the looks of Davidson's cable, it might even go higher than that. And we haven't even got a camera over there.
But his leg!
Get that idea out of your mind. It will only lead you in the wrong direction.
Well, officer -- do your duty.
For instance?
Thanks.
Then where is she -- in the ice box?
Who left -- where?
Doyle -- are you interested in solving a case, or making me look foolish?
What's the matter? Does he have a courtesy card from the police department?
Just make sure you're not caught. If you find something, you've got a murderer and nobody will care about a couple of house rules. If you find nothing -- he's clear.
How did we ever stand each other in that same plane for three years?
Well, in the garage, back home, we --
All the things I hate.
I told you that --
For getting rid of that cast.
Indo-China. Got a code tip from the bureau chief this morning. The place is about to go up in smoke.
You're too valuable to the magazine for us to play around with. I'll send Morgan or Lambert.
I'll -- I'll get married. Then I'll never be able to go anywhere.
The word is "everything." Now what time does my plane leave Tuesday?
Did you get my note?
Then if the police get me -- you won't be around to laugh!
I don't want to.
Stella!
How did you know!
She's real eat, drink and be merry girl.
Speaking of misery, Miss Lonely Hearts drank herself to sleep again. Alone.
And some man will lose his.
Uh-uh. The dog. I think I know now why Thorwald killed it.
Then I wouldn't worry too much. But let's keep an eye on her.
There's probably one in the basement.
Smart girl.
I'm afraid it is, Tess.
Mmmm -- hurts a little.
Empty as a football.
Hasn't been any big demand for tickets.
I wanted to, Jeff.  Oh!
You have, perhaps, an ambulance outside?
That's what I'm afraid of.  Could you see me -- driving down to the fashion salon in a jeep -- wearing combat boots and a three day beard? 
Miss Lonely Hearts. At least that's something you'll never have to worry about.
Three.
Homework. It's more interesting.
Do you think I consider this recreation?
I want to find out what's wrong with the salesman's wife. Does that make me sound like a madman?
Where's the doctor -- the undertakers?
There's nothing to see.
You could see all the things he did, couldn't you?
And that's where you're not being clever. He wouldn't parade his crime in front of the open shades.
Someone not his wife?
He will. All his things are still piled on the bed.
Not yet!
Don't be too hard on him. He's a steady worker. I wish he'd get there, though.
Lisa, I won't be able to give you any --
That's a suitcase?
It's utterly beautiful.  I wish I could be creative.
I'm not much on rear window ethics.
I think I'll start reviving it tomorrow, with say -- Miss Torso for a start?
Well, -- if there was one less thread this way --  -- and two less that way --  -- I might give up bachelorhood.
Is he cleaning house?
Think you've got enough for a search warrant now?
Good luck, Buzz.
Who's fighting?  This is the test, man.  It's a crazy game.
How 'bout you?  Say the word and you're cold, Jack--you're dead.
Down in back.
You still want to go home, Moose?
Then shut your mouth before your guts run out!
Hold it, Jim.
You make any sandwiches?
Sure--  You know something?  I have a feeling we're going to stay here.
I'm not hungry.
Is there some kind of trick answer?
Well, now--
I'm in terrible trouble.--You know that big high bluff near Miller- town Junction?
She never wants to hear.  She doesn't care!
Are you listening to me?  You're involved in this!  I want to go to the police and tell them I was mixed up in this thing tonight?
You better give me something, Dad. You better give me something  Mom?
Go on--Give 'em to your friends.
That's right!
What's that pounding?
Stay here.  That was my son!
Yes, sir.
Do you hear from him, son?
What's the charge?
My parents know I'm out.  They know I'm here.
Jim.  What's yours?
Who knows.  Plato?
My personality's showing again. Should I leave?
Why don't you come home with me?  I mean nobody's home at my house--and I'm not tired, are you?  I don't have many--people I can talk to.
Yeah?
Shut up.  Are you nuts?
Who?
All right, darling.
It doesn't matter how.  I was driving a stolen car--
What's that got to do with it?
You're not going to use me as an excuse again, Mom.  Every time you can't face yourself you want to move and you say it's because of me or the neighborhood or some other phony excuse.  Now I want to do one thing right and I'm not letting you run away.  Dad?
Hang loose, boy.  I'm warning you.
No.
I just get so--  Boy, sometimes the temperature goes way up. RAY  Okay.  Okay.  Let it out.
And your folks didn't understand?
So then you moved?
But you don't think that's a solution.
Pretty mixed up?
"If he could" what?  You mean your father?
Want me to imitate a stupid cop?
Listen--
You going there?
So have I.  But I've never been in love.  Isn't that awful?
I bet you hear everything I say!
Not exactly.  It's certainly huge.
You disappointed?
Yes.  My best friend.
Yes.  And so terribly annoying when they cry.  I just don't know what to do when they cry, do you dear?
He calls me a dirty tramp--my own father!
We used to sing it in school.  Don't look at me with such horror. They had schools in those days.
No.  Why?
I didn't kiss her so it's a big thing.
I'd like to, that's all.  Girls your age don't do that.  You need an explanation?
Gabriel!
Please, Gabriel, don't...
YES!!!
We're talking, aren't we?
-- plus the forty to Mason... how many letters is that?
Didn't have to hit me so fucking hard. Didn't have to throw me outta the goddamn truck.
What, he should see me help you catch him?
No, hey, I like your coat --
I can get another one going. Y'know, hey, whatever you want me to --
Blackjack, Nick, blackjack I am good at. I mean, they'd give us some free games or something, wouldn't they? Since you worked there?
And the slots, slots I'm good at too. Wouldn't that be fun?
Nick, what are you --
You told him about Nick's letters.
If you say that, if you keep saying that, they will kill you. If they think you're not you, they will kill you. Don't you see? I know what you're doing, but it won't work!
Just tell him what you know, Nick! That's all they want! And we'll get out of this!
For what? You to talk me into "helping"? What, he promise you a share of the winnings?
They run routes mostly east, retail stuff, warehouses. But Gabriel knows some guys in New York, Miami, guys he helps get guns to Detroit. Hides 'em with his regular loads.
What?
We're gonna get out of here, Nick. We're gonna get out of this...
There went my... damn... well, doesn't seem like security's all that switched... Ash, shit, this mustache is starting to fall off. I gotta fix this thing --  -- drink this for me.
All I wanted... was to make it home... for a little of Dad's turkey, and Mom's stuffing... Aunt Lisbeth's acorn gravy... Aunt Mary's cranberry buns...
If he wanted a photographic memory, he shoulda kidnapped one. I'm working on it here.
You're the getaway girl. The money's gonna get to you eventually. Gonna be my job to be the guy who walks outta there with it. But I can't do that without a gun. Any luck talking to him?
We need a gun, Ash. We need a gun...
We go together, Nick. Wherever... we go together. Remember?
You were screaming you weren't Nick! And we just didn't fucking believe you!
You said it a million times!
You got the wrong guy! She thinks I'm Nick, I'm not!
Yes!
What?
Samantha.
What college.
Her brother.
Nick don't talk till Nick gets something.
This is the front entrance, right? You get through the slots, you hit craps here, not blackjack. Blackjack's here to here -- lined up. What's this, the cage? Cage is over there, hard to get to, you got it all mixed around --
Why not.
We'll trust you when we're rich. Why not.
More than you know.
Get out.
Nnn... nothing...
I have no gifts to bring, pa-rumpum- pum-pum
You go in with five, you're either leaving an alarm free or an exit free. Someone hits an alarm, you're fucked. Someone gets to a phone, gets outside, 'cross the street, whatever, you're fucked. You need six.  Six is me.
Well. What you guys have to plan out, then... is how you're going to get to that cage and that security level before anybody realizes anything's wrong. Running in with ski masks and bullets flying ain't gonna do it.
'Tis the season, convict.
Hey! HEY! THERE IS A POWWOW SAFE!
Was it your plan, Monster? Or was it hers.
Get in there and watch 'em. Watch their every fuckin' move.
I don't steal any --
OPEN IT!!!
Oh. Right. Yeah. That's, uh upstairs. Uh. Here. Powwow Safe.
There anytime you don't got a mouthful of shit?
And Monster... he was talking with the casino manager. Nick was talking to him.
That right? Shit. I used to run rigs for a guy loved your chaw there. Shit rotted out his tongue, had to build him one outta silicon so the poor boy could talk. You ever see a motherfucker with a silicon fucking tongue?
My guy would walk into a room, set off the goddamn sprinklers.
I got a bacon for him and a bacon for me; there's four cheeseburgers and two roast beefs --
My what?!
I been in Iron Mountain for two years, truck driver. I do one more crime, I'm back there for good, so fuck you and fuck your sister and fuck your trucker friends. You want to hear about some goddamn job of mine? I want some hot-goddamn-chocolate.
Buffet is by the goddamn bar! What the hell kind of map is this?!
He didn't recognize me. Back off, willya? He didn't recognize me.
Haven't thought about it.
Yeah. You grow up in Detroit, you get matured real quick.
No, I think that's just oranges. She writes here she's eating oranges.
Thought you hate your old man.
You're GONNA be there! We're getting outta here! TAKE IT!
Well...sorry...
There is no other table --
I'M NOT NICK!
Now where were we?
Yes.
You tried to fuck me in my father's office, you sick bastard. Look, Vic, whatever you wanna do in the privacy of your own home, go do it. But don't try to fuck me. I don't think of you that way. I mean, I like you a lot -
You're coming back to work for us, right?
Who?
Me and you'll drive down to Long Beach tomorrow. I'll introduce you to Matthews, tell him what's going on.
That's okay, Eddie, I do.
I got a bag. I stashed it till I could be sure this place wasn't a police station.
I gotta go along with Mr. Pink on this. I've seen it happen.
It's not the black Beverly Hills, it's the black Palos Verdes. Anyway, this chick, Elois, was a man-eater- upper. I bet every guy who's ever met her has jacked off to her at least once. You know who she looked like? Christie Love. 'Member that TV show "Get Christie Love"? She was a black female cop. She always used to say "You're under arrest, sugar."
What the fuck was that chick's name? Oh this is just great, I'm totally fuckin' tortured now.
Let me say this out loud, just to get it straight in my mind. According to you, Mr. Blonde was gonna kill you. Then when we came back, kill us, grab the diamonds, and scram. That's your story? I'm correct about that, right?
This better not be some Freddy joke.
...What bar?
You ever seen this motherfucker before?
Did the two of you talk?
Yeah.
It's a scene. Memorize it.
It's like a joke. You remember what's important, and the rest you make your own. The only way to make it your own is to keep sayin' it, and sayin' it, and sayin' it, and sayin' it, and sayin' it.
He's a cool guy. A real nice, real funny, real cool guy.
What for?
What? Snap out of it!
A guy named Scagnetti. Seymour Scagnetti.
What the hell did you expect me to do? Just forget about you?
It's not about a nice girl who meets a sensitive boy. Now granted that's what "True Blue" is about, no argument about that.
Oh fuck, Toby's that little china girl.
I tried that once, it don't work. You get four guys fighting over who's gonna be Mr. Black. Since nobody knows anybody else, nobody wants to back down. So forget it, I pick. Be thankful you're not Mr. Yellow.
Jesus Christ, Joe. Fuckin' forget it. This is beneath me. I'm Mr. Pink, let's move on.
Dead as Dillinger.
How many employees?
No, they're not.
He don't tip.
Freddy Newendyke.
You're not gonna fucking die, all right?
It's not good...
I don't believe in it.
I don't tip because society says I gotta. I tip when somebody deserves a tip. When somebody really puts forth an effort, they deserve a little something extra. But this tipping automatically, that shit's for the birds. As far as I'm concerned, they're just doin' their job.
Oh this is bad, this is so bad.  Is it bad?
This is so fucked up. Somebody fucked us big time.
That's not correct.
Uh-uh, just cops.
How can you be so sure?
I don't buy it. Me and Joe go back a long time. I can tell ya straight up, Joe definitely didn't have anything to do with this bullshit.
For all I know, you're the rat.
If we don't, he'll die.
You said yourself, you thought about takin' him out.
I'll make you a bet that those same damn niggers who were showin' their ass in public, when their bitches get 'em home, they chill the fuck out.
Too much excitement. How about the surrey. Can you fix it?
I'm Clay Phillips.  My brother Steve.
Yeah.
Hold on.
It's a long walk back to Aspen.
I suppose it is.
Not on this trail, I don't. I've been over it before. Anyway, you ought to be pretty sleepy. Why don't you climb in back.
Why do you think?
Yes. But -- that was the other night. Now -- I don't think I would.
I suppose that's my fault.
There won't be any rest of the trip. Over the hill is a stage road and when we hit it you get dumped into the first stage that comes along. So keep your money. You'll need it for the fare. I'm fed up with you. I was fed up with you before we started.
I can't help how I think. You're trained a certain way when you're a kid and you can't change.
Maybe they will.
I haven't got the job yet.
No call to. That jail looked pretty solid to me.  How's she feel?
All right. I'll tell you.
How'd you happen to miss?
Good thing you didn't.
I guess I have. You were pretty little when they locked him up. I don't suppose you even remember that time I was gone two months.
Finished, son?
Just the grub box and bed rolls.
What makes you think you're so almighty? Telling people what to do and how to act when you don't even know how yourself.
Like I told you, half those horses are mine. I'm makin' sure they get to the ranch safe. So let's quit arguing and do whatever you figure on doin'.
Guess maybe I'm old enough to hold my own in a fight, huh?
Three men on matched roans?
Nobody asked you to.
I'm sorry. Let's go.
He won't take us.  Don't you want us around?
If you're worried about Mary and me talkin' too much, don't. No matter how many questions your old man asks. We know how to keep our mouths shut.
Don't talk -- eat -- we want to get you well quick as we can so we can all get out of here.
No. But it's mine and I didn't want anyone foolin' with it.
Well, say it.
Yeah.
They shouldn't have done that.
Now where's she goin'? --
That's not what's worryin' me. Why didn't she tell us? Maybe we could have done somethin' -- gone somewhere else -- puttin' a poor sick kid through this --
No we don't. But that's where we're going. From Minden we take a stage to Reno, then another one over to Auburn and another one to Placerville. Then it's a day's trip to Sonora.
That's it then.
I don't care what he thinks.
Stop it --
Where is he?
One night more won't matter. Your friend'll be there. Anyway I don't think so much of the idea of prowling around his ranch. He knows you're out so he ain't going to sit still for it.
Mine's gone lame. Take a look at him.
Will you quit gabbin' and do what you're told.
That'd be swell.  You know, you're an awful lot different than I thought you'd be.
From A to Z. All you have to do now is figure out what they mean put together in words.
Unicorn -- a kind of animal --
You don't read to fill your stomach... Poetry, for instance. All the poems in the world wouldn't fill you half as much as a bowl of eatmeal -- but they make you feel good.
Now I know what a unicorn is, what do we do next?
Oh, sure.
It's a long ways yet.  I figure we ought to camp. She's tired.
Thanks, Steve.
Do I know you?
It would've just been you, if you would've kept your mouth shut.
Hello Ray.
Ray, have you been here all this time?
Yeah, I think I'll feel better sleeping in the arms of a strong man.
Okay.
Wow, she's beautiful. You really think she looks like me?
Wait, I want to check something. Give me a hand.
Oh, Buddy, I was thinking the same thing. It might be our last night in this house. And I think we should take full advantage of it.
Can you feel that?
No. Keep rubbing.
Now, come on -- you know I'm not ready for that kind of --
There's something I want to share with you too. Here, smell this.
Look, what I'm trying to say --
Oh, Buddy, I've never had someone be so protective of me!
So, whatever happened to her?
Yeah, I broke my fall.
Yes, Professor Oldman's group. Forgive me. I didn't mean to frighten you.
I'm Hanson the caretaker.
Not in a thousand years.
Yes, it was me all along. I killed Hugh Kane and his mistress.
Now you'll be mine, Cindy.
Yes!!!!
I don't need your help.
My child, you're alive!
Nah, I need a place to stay. So how do you like being in college?
Uh, uh.
Let me see the files.
That one.
Sounds good. I'm just going to run up to my room. Hop in the shower. Jump into my jogging suit, and I'll be right there.
Let's not forget, folks, this is a study on sleep disorders.
What is it? Some tits? A beaver shot? What?
It's not what is looks like. She's having a breakdown. Help me get her to her room.
You do.
Yes... Sometimes you have to give them candy.
Not unless you have a paternity test to prove it.
Yeah, I always wanted to watch you eat.
I am Tom Green, I am Tom Green. Daddy want some sausage, sausage. Daddy want some sausage...
Hey, dude, you got a tattoo.
I'm totally freakin' dude. I keep having these nightmares, then I wake up screaming with these awful back spasms. I can't take it anymore, man.
Mom, Mr. Stubbins is a nimrod!
Mother? 
That's right up the street! Come on! Just in case!
Carl can't believe how much I make at swap meets.
It's a cool idea, Misty! Let's make a gore movie about Mom! Better yet, a TV series!
He certainly drives like a jerk.
"Serial Mom"?  WOW!
Let me see!
Oh Mom...
Looks good, Mom!
Doesn't threaten me, honey. I'm happy.
MISTY SUTPHIN, GET IN THIS CAR!!
That's nice.
Officers, I've never said the P-word out loud, much less written it down!
Misty, I made your favorite sesame broccoli... 
I've identified every little birdie we're going to watch tomorrow on the Eastern Shore.
You're not bad yourself, coo-coo bird...
Oh, honey!
NO I DON'T, YOU BITCH!
Mrs. Wilson from the telephone company. I understand you're having problems with obscene calls.
I can't say it out loud. I don't use bad language.
COCKSUCKER! 
I didn't do it!
Socially... I'll have a beer.
Misty, if you want to lose weight go ahead, but do it for yourself, not for some boy you barely know.
...Browsing.
Nice to meet you, Mr. Stubbins.  A little something I baked.
He's a good boy.
Divorce? An alcoholic relative?  Tell me, did Chip torture animals when he was young?
Excuse me, Mrs. Sutphin.
Okay, Mr. Radeau, it's forgot.
Which room is it?
Yes.
You could go and open the door.
No.
What sort of danger?
She could use a hundred dollars.
For the time being, I imagine that must do.
"The Dante?"
I'll try there.
Thank you.
Nothing.
No...At the morgue they told me a Mr. Gregory Ward had made inquiries about Jacqueline.
Because I loved Jacqueline I thought I knew her. Today I found out such strange things --frightening things. I saw a hangman's noose that she had hanging -- waiting -- I feel as if I'd never known her.
But you do believe me?
But you have treated me that way.
A poet. He's sitting right over there. That's his table -- the one at the feet of Dante.
Things changed, Mary. The reasons for finding Jacqueline changed. I want to find Jacqueline to settle things.
Good night.
Don't be ridiculous. For months I've had the best private detective in New York looking for Miss Gibson.
Look here, just because Mrs. Romari asked you to amuse us.
This is the part of New York I love. It is old. It has memories. If you listen, the houses will speak to you. Walt Whitman...Edna St. Vincent Millay... Eugene O'Neill...in their time they've all lived here.
I suppose so. I can pick him up somewhere.
Verse -- verse that I wrote. I need it.
You know about the Palladists -- you know who they are -- what they are. I was one of them.
I have something even better.
I'm at sea, Jason.
I can imagine.
But it's a small room, Jason.
Jason, I'm going back to Highcliffe. I came to say good-by.
Bella Romari	If I were not seated, I would embrace you in three movements like a sonata.  Ah, my wonderful one. Fly with me tonight. We will take your coffee machine and live with the gypsies.
We are happy, Mrs. Romari, because you have everything -- and I am happy because I have nothing to lose.
You don't expect me to do that do you?
One believes -- it's like any other religion...
Because you are intelligent -- that's why they sent me to you --
A strange collection. You're like the false god you worship... fallen angels, all of you.
Leave me your address, and if I find anything, I'll get in touch with you.
Giacomo -- la bellisslina madonna --
She's not been here for a long time.
Yes -- and pays the rent every month.
I doubt if you'll get anything out of that woman. But if  you'd like to try, I'll advance you the money to make the trip to New York. Of course, my dear, if you don't find your sister, you can always come back here.
Yes?
I don't know no Gibson. This is a restaurant. Many people come here.
When?
I can quote that too; "Those who shall go out into the market place and let their tongues speak of us, and give knowledge of our being and our deeds, whom-so-ever doeth this shall die."
What about Judd -- he knows about us.
Oh. Well, maybe I'm uncomfortable with my appearance. I feel a little out of place in these surroundings.
Exactly. I would say the fact that you feel the first year of your marriage has gone by quickly means lots of things. Or could mean lots of things.
I would imagine that we are, now. I think I'm ready to use the bathroom, finally.
Who's Elizabeth?
I feel like they do.
I don't know, he just said he wants to wait. I quit asking.
Impotent.
Not usually. I mean, honestly, I haven't known many guys that could think straight with an erection, so I feel I'm way ahead of the game as far as being clear-headed goes.
I am self-conscious, but not in the same way that you are. You have got to be the most attractive self- conscious person I've ever seen.
Well, I wasn't always impotent.
That's correct.  Bit of a dilemma, isn't it?
Videotapes.
Donna. On this tape it says "Donna".
All of these are interviews?
Yes.
It won't. Are you ready?
It's a simple question. Have you ever thought of having -- making love with someone other than your husband?
At some level, I don't understand your nervousness. Have you decided to leave John?
Do you want me to stop?
So you have had sex.
I don't know anymore. I thought I was, but obviously I was wrong.
Not yet. I'm not sure I will. I just want out.
Kind of. I mean, John's like this kind of... craftsman. Like he's a carpenter, and he makes really good tables. But that's all he can make, and I don't need anymore tables.
I'm not planning on it.
I... I can't answer that precisely.
Ann. Are you asking me hypothetically, or are you asking me for real, right now?
Yes.
I don't know. I really would rather not talk about it.
Why not?
Stay away from the Garden District. Serious crime. I don't know what kind of place you're looking for, but there are a lot of studio-type apartments available elsewhere.
That's interesting, because I didn't leave a message.
Are you having an affair?
If I'm right, I want to know. I don't want you to lie. I'd be very upset, but not as upset as if I'd found out you'd been lying.
I can't tell you how upset I would be if you were lying.
My sister, for one. Is that who it is?
Quitting your therapy won't feed the children of Ethiopia.
I want out of this marriage.
I want out of this marriage.
Not very often.
About a week ago. I don't know what brought it on, I just started feeling like I didn't want him to touch me.
I take it you've never masturbated?
I've been thinking about it for awhile, and then I was talking to somebody who kind of put things in perspective for me.
Yes.
Not really.
He's not getting a phone, he doesn't like talking on the phone.
I don't feel right just giving you the address so that you can go over there and...
Why not?
Well, like what did he ask, exactly?
Did he touch you?
You are in trouble.
I mean, I couldn't do that in front of John, even.
That doesn't mean you do. You can't possibly trust him, he's... perverted.
Hold on.
Okay.
Bye.
She still is.
Nope.
Nope.
I, uh, know a guy at the power company.
I think you're right. So come on, I came all the way over here to find out what got Ann so spooked, tell me what happened.
Nothing.
I just want to ask you questions.
Absolutely not. They are for my private use only.
Yes.
Whichever you prefer.
I was... eight years old. Michael Green, who was also eight, asked if he could watch me take a pee. I said he could if I could watch him take one, too. He said okay, and then we went into the woods behind our house. I got this feeling he was chickening out because he kept saying, "Ladies first!" So I pulled down my underpants and urinated, and he ran away before I even finished.
When I was fourteen.
It was warmer than I thought it would be, and the skin was softer than it looked. It's weird. Thinking about it now, the organ itself seemed like a separate thing, a separate entity to me. I mean, after he pulled it out and I could look at it and touch it, I completely forgot that there was a guy attached to it. I remember literally being startled when the guy spoke to me.
Yes.
Okay.
I can't talk you into it?
Goddamit, give me my tape, then.
I only get one today? Gee, how exciting.
Cynthia, I don't think you want to, I mean, you should see the way he dresses. I really think he's in a bad way.
Cynthia. John.
Right now.
Doesn't work. He has to know the people, he has to be able to interact with them.
It's just something I'd prefer she didn't know about.
What do you mean?
By definition you're lying to Ann, too.
Look, are we going to do it or not?
I knew it, I knew it. Things are getting complicated.
Will you lease month-to-month?
What do you think the Greeks would make of that outfit you're wearing?
You were prying before?
You know which tapes! Where are they?
I'm not going to give you my keys.
Yeah.
All right, jesus.
He hates doctors. Doctors and lawyers. He never goes to doctors.
Hi. Want a drink?
I knew the man, Emil Hobbes, a doctor and a professor at university. I saw the girl around the building but I didn't know her. She never came to the clinic.
Uh, OK. Sure.
Didn't she ever have these lumps looked at by a doctor?
Who was she?
Huh?
WITH LEGS LIKE MINE I'M REALLY MADE FOR DANCING
BREAKING OUT
Of course.
You got it!
I'm Janet Majors and this is my husband Brad.
It's no use pussyfooting around, Janet -- we have to cut quick and deep.
After breakfast.  You're sounding tense, Janet.  Maybe I could give you a little massage?
Show yourself.  The real you. The secret you.
It's happened before.  Remember Lieutenant Orpheus?  He disappeared into that Underworld series and never came back.
Yes, Betty.
He was a President.
Shove it, Ralph!
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR THE FASHION
He was adopted you know.
He moved all right!  When they found him with fifteen other naked men at the back of Wilson's Bakery.
Sure thing.
The question is, does Brad want to see you?  Quite frankly, he hates you.
Why?
YOUNG BLOOD
I understand your concern, but I feel it's time you started thinking of yourself.  Look at yourself.
Absolutely true.  Compared to all of them, you are perfection, flawless beauty.
Do you really think so?
But what'll I do?  What'll I say?  What'll I wear?
What does he know about it?
YOU PLAY FOR BROKE...
OH ROMANCE IS NOT A CHILDREN'S GAME...
LIKE A DEEP PLUM LIPSTICK AND SOME THERAPEUTICS
We're not confused.
I liked it when you caught me fucking him.
I don't know, Christine. Perhaps it's because I feel attacked.
I love you.
Good, good. Drinking some good wines and kicking back, you know. So what's happening? Still no word?
Absolutement.  They have their own label that's just outstanding.
Tight as a nun's asshole but qood concentration. Nice fruit.
Bottle.
If I was, I would sing your praises up and down the street until they put me in the loony bin. Now Miles, why didn't you tell me you were coming and bringing this handsome man? Look how I'm dressed. I've got to run and put my face on.
Yeah, I remember the girl who was in it with me. She was something.
Couple of wrong turns.  Thanks to Magellan, here.
Hi.  Maya's in the kitchen.
You said you had it all lined up.
Color in the red wines comes from the skins. This juice is free run, so there's no skin contact in the fermentation, ergo no color.
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
And Miles is my best man, Mrs. Raymond. My main man.
It's not worth it. You pay too big a price. It's never free.
I'm working on it.
I thought you hated Chardonnay.
Thanks, Jack. So do I.  Here we are.
When do we get to drink it?
Just a minute!
Not with the wine list these people have. We don't want to hold back.
Whoa.
If that's what feels right.
Well, she does know a lot about wine.
And she likes Pinot.
So what's the plan today?
With Maya?
If anyone orders Merlot, I'm leaving. I am not drinking any fucking Merlot!
I'm fine!
We were supposed to play golf.
Okay! Jesus!
Deep.
And what about Stephanie? She's a woman -- with a kid. A single mom. What do you think she's looking for? Huh?
What? Of course I like Christine.
Sure, whatever. Maybe I'll catch a movie.
Yeah.
She's working. I need a break anyway. She's getting a little clingy.  This is our day!
Nope.
You're an asshole.
I don't know. Got it from Stephanie.
I don't want to talk about it.
What's happening?
No.
Who's being selfish now? I'm the one getting married. I thought this week was supposed to be about me.
I know what you need.
Yeah, it's Frass Canyon. It's a joke.
What's up?
Half my life is over, and I have nothing to show for it. I'm a thumbprint on the window of a skyscraper. I'm a smudge of excrement on a tissue surging out to sea with a million tons of raw sewage.
Sure I'm sure. And just what are you implying? I'm really pissed off at you about all this, if you want to know the truth. What's Maya going to think of me now just for associating with you? You're the one who's sabotaging me, not the other way around, pal. Not by a longshot.
You're joking, right?  What are you doing? Un-fucking- believeable. Can we just go back to the hotel and hang out and get up early and play nine holes before we head home?
Jesus, Jack. Jesus. And you walked all the way back from Solvang?
No way. No way.
Quite a week.
So I'll see you at the rehearsal.
Back at you.
A Fiddlehead Sauvignon Blanc.
I know the winemaker. She comes in the restaurant all the time.
I think they overdid it a bit. Too much alcohol. Overwhelms the fruit.
Mrnmm, yeah... but not really. It shifts around a lot. Like you also start to see everything from the point of view of the father. And some other stuff happens, some parallel narrative, and then it evolves -- or devolves -- into a kind of a Robbe-Grillet mystery -- you know, with no real resolution.
A paper?
Yeah.
Good. So did I.
Well, nice to see you now.
Great. What's the latest we can get there?
Okay.
What rehearsal dinner?
Oh, just that he loves her. That she's the only woman who has ever really rocked his world. How he adores Siena. How he wants to move up here and get a place with the two of them and commute when he has to.
Yeah.
It's Miles. Listen, I don't know if you even care, but I had to call and tell you again how much I enjoyed our time together and how sorry I am things turned out the way they did. I think you're great, Maya -- always have. From the first time you waited on me.  And while I'm at it, I guess you should know that my book is not getting published. I thought this one had a chance, but I was wrong. Again. Don't bother reading it -- you've got better things to do. So you see I'm not much of a writer. I'm not anything really. The only real talent I seem to have is for disappointing people and now you know that firsthand. We're leaving in the morning, and I want you to know that I take with me wonderful memories of you. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
I'm pregnant.
Well, I've come to never expect greatness from a Cab Franc, and this one's no exception. Sort of a flabby, overripe --
Exactement!
She has a Richebourg? Mon dieu. I have completely underestimated Stephanie.
Just kickin' back, I guess. I don't know. Jack and I were supposed to go golfing.
Yeah, I reserved the tee time about a month ago.
You golf?
Huh. Jack loves golf. Crazy about it.
Bye, Stephanie. Bye, Siena, Caryl.
You fucking bastard! Lying piece of shit! You're getting married on Saturday? What was all that shit you said to me?
Oh, that's right. Isn't that nice? I hope that girls knows how lucky she is, marrying no less than Derek Summersby.
Well, you boys do what you want. I just think it would be nice for us to be together as a family on my birthday.
It tastes old.
This one?
Me too.
I don't feel much.
I'm here.
I've had two separate folks tell me they think there are strangers around these parts the last couple of nights. Can't tell what they look like, cause they're staying in the shadows -- covert like. No one's got hurt mind you... And that's the give away.
Yes it was.
Yes, it was.
I got him.
We have to go in the basement.
What are you doing?
From what?
A mass evacuation by them started about eight o'clock this morning. It's eleven now.  They're leaving. Beat.
I know.  We need to be sure, before we open that door Graham.
We can't just sit in the car in our own driveway like this.
Yes. They would invade us using only ground tactics. Hand to hand combat. They wouldn't use their technology or fight an airborne battle, because they would know we would eventually use nuclear weapons and the planet would be useless to them.
Where are we going to sleep?
Don't call me Father. It's just Graham now.
What kind of machine can bend a stalk of corn over without cracking it?
Edgar, it sounds as strange to me saying it, as it is to you hearing it. But we couldn't see him. He stayed mostly in the shadows. All we could make out was movement.  But I'll tell you something with absolute certainty. There was someone watching our house last night. He was looking in my children's windows and I want you to find him Edgar.  I need you to take this seriously, just in case, it is something serious.
Pinned? What does that mean?
Don't worry.
That's why they got you in jail?
What friend is that?
It was my fault.
Sounds good.
She was hurt... pretty bad.  Emmett, they took the little boy with them.
Have you thought at all about your plans?
Yeah, me and Jake will be heading out for California soon.
This is a brutal land.
How's Mr. Parker doing?
Ten A.M.
I had to get up anyway.
Looks like that's not all they admired.
I expect.
He is that.
No hard feelings.
Oh, I was just checking the, ah...  ...you know, lookin' in.
I paid the government for it, all right. That don't mean much out here.  Malachi, I'm living like a wildcat in a cave in those hills. Hiding out, afraid to walk my own land.
We got married just before this trip, so we could come out here and try the land. It's hard to find a man willing to take on a life like that.
And a pretty lady.
His son is worse than he was. He's smoother, so you don't always hear him coming, but he'll do anything to keep his range free.
I can't say I'm convinced you're going anywhere.
He is now.
Let's get out of here.
We're going to make some adjustments. I wanted you to be here when I offered Paden your job. I think he could do it without getting greedy. Stella and I are tired of you skimming our profits.
This nigger's breaking up my place, Sheriff Langston.
Who did it?
They're watching the Hollis place. I can't get through.
Good luck, Mal.
He's good, all right. Too good for my men. That's why you've got to take care of it.
Well I'm real happy for you, Cobb. But I think I'll keep looking for mine.
You didn't tell me you owned a saloon.
Nothing. Do nothing. Don't get between us.
So we understand each other?
Cobb, you've got nothing I need.
I run the place. What can I get you?
The world is what you make of it, friend. If it doesn't fit, you make alterations.
You see that fellow over there in the gray coat?
That was my plan.
It wasn't her body.  It was her body of work.
I think he owes more to you.  But that's not important now.  I know what's going on between you two.
Damn --  Yes -- I --  -- I'm just a little tired. Listen, Elaine, Viktor and I -- it's strictly a working relationship.  We could never be anything else.  We're just so... different.
We don't need a name.  We'll cast an unknown.
We can hardly make a profit with them.  Up-front salary, back-end deal, perks, per diem, percentages -- They're mocking us, Elaine. We're at their mercy.  We always had movie stars but they used to be our stars.  We used to decide who would play what role. We told them what to wear, what to say, who to date.  When they were under contract, we could change their names if we wanted to -- more than once!
Well, I do remember why I started out in this business -- you seem to have forgotten -- working in New York with Cassevetes -- we were trying to do something important, shine a light in that darkened cinema --
-- Illuminate hearts and minds with a ray of truth.
So there's no problem -- I can have the rights, the negative too?
I don't need a star.  All I need is an actor -- I'll reshoot the part, cut out Nicola and replace her with a real actor.  A real leading lady.
Out of the question.  A circus like that?
If it's on the page...
What about it?
Even the fall from the plane.
Thank you.  What did you think, Lainey?
Thank you.  I'll tell Simone you liked it.
Not now.  She's emotional.  Her mother dies today.  Scene forty-two of "Good For Nothing".  It's not a good time.
You're so good to protect her like this.
Elaine, what are you doing tonight? Would you like to go somewhere -- dinner?
When is she coming over?
I suppose I could stay, just until she arrives.
No.  She'll never work again -- retire, never make a movie or a record, or appear ever again.
Right beside you.  I borrowed Viktor's car.
Sometimes.  But, just when I think your father's changing for the better, I realize he's as self absorbed as ever.  He took the credit for Simone tonight.
Just a minute.
Because obviously she existed, right?
I mean really meet her -- in the flesh.
Why?
Please put your clothes on
You don't secretly want the attention?
What exactly was it that attracted you to your first two projects?
Frank, you know as well as I do, living in a fish bowl, the insatiable appetite of the media...
Clyde.
Really?  She didn't mention it.
Viktor, Clyde simply has to get close to Simone in this scene!  He has to touch her.  He has to!
Why not?
I know what you mean.
I was misquoted.
That's right.  You were booed off the stage.  That's got to be -- ?
You do?
I'm already dead.
It's really... not anything, Lainey.  It's just --
You look very grown up.  What are you doing?  You meeting your mom for dinner?
This week anyhow.
Why?
I know plenty of boys.
Really?  Too bad.
I'll see what I can do.  You know, Lainey.  I don't believe you've ever once asked to meet Simone.  Don't you like her?
Why not?  I can get you something else.  What do you want?
This is the story.
Abduction?
Er,... good.
Looks familiar, doesn't she?  No one comes from nowhere, Taransky. You turn over enough rocks...
That won't be necessary.  Sooner or later I knew you'd crack this thing, Max.  You got me.
Maybe he's talking to himself.
Dark?
My God, you've got one?
It's not the size of the role, Viktor.  Am I or am I not contractually entitled to the biggest trailer on the set?
Yes, I'd like that.
Thank you.
You are birth of... what?  A Phenomenon.  A miracle.  A new era in show business.  All I wanted to do was finish the film.
Why do you have to bring that up? There's always risk -- life's a risk.  It's worth it.  Besides, how could something so lovely be a crime?  Well, I think we've done enough for today.  You've been cooped up in there too long.  How about you and me go out on the town?  They're expecting us.
Three? We should hock it. Buy a C.D. rack for the bedroom.
We can keep it in the bathroom.
Tell me.
Okay. Fine. Understood.  I'm off then.
Thanks.
Oh, lots of things, I suppose. Bad people for one. People who wanted to imprison them. Hurt them.
Congratulations.
Next time I won't be scared of you.
You saw that on T.V., Cole?
You mean aneurysm.
I don't tell her a thing.
What?
Who me?
Them?
Yes.
I don't know.
Don't fail me.
Someone else can help you. Someone else can make you happy.
I don't think that's the way it works, Cole.
Maybe.
Lots of things.
You'd cry. Cause you miss grandma so much.
I'm ready to communicate with you now.
Oh my God.
Ghosts.
Cole, please stop.
You talked funny when you went to school here. You talked funny all the way to high school!
J. C. Penny's?
What are you talking about?
Superstition.
Nope.
Nikes? What-the-hail you talkin' about?
Fuck me? Fuck YOU!!
Which street corner?
...Hi.
The hell with this.  I'm coming back up!!!
Yeah. It's the alternator all right.
Sorry.
You need someone who can protect you, Suzie.
He should turn that music down. Jeremiah's gonna kill him.
Hell, no. But you missed a damn good sermon. "You can't hide a wicked heart from the eyes of the Lord."
Book of Jeremiah.
Two hundred bucks?? Are you crazy?
Shotgun. Suicide. Next?
Cowshit? Are you sure the Aztecs even had cows?
It harvests! It threshes! Look at these blades.
Come out, come out wherever you are!
Joseph Macdonald. Damn right, boy. And don't you forget it.
I'll be fine here.
People say he was a murderer.
I --
I'm admiring your costume. What "movie" are you going as again?
Dammit, Karen -- I was just... looking for your pulse.
Who? Us?!
Buzzzzzzzzzz. Sorry, wrong answer!
Relax. He liked what he saw. Well, some of it. Enough to give us a showcase audition. One week from today.
Yeah, that's right! I'm outta here -- Y'all can kiss my city ass goodbye!... I'm gone with the wind.
Then why go back now?
When I was a kid... I was never allowed up here...
Let it go.
I... heard something... came in here last night. Must have gone to sleep.
Look. You want to talk about this?
You've been... hiding him all these years. Helping him... irrigate the land. With blood...
Like what?
Us? We been... moonlighting.
CARL??? Carl did this?!!
Bill, we need to talk!
I don't know. I've seen them so many times before. I guess any spot gets boring after awhile.
Hey, Grant.
He tried to kill you, Starla.
When you wanted to run away, I called your dad.
Think we should get up a search party, head in there?
I see. It's like as if he's going in a pattern. Is that what you're saying, Bill?
Hey, Wally. Glad you're here. There was something I wanted to tell you...
What the fuck they gonna do with her in a hospital, Bill?
Shelby, shut up. Keep an eye out for these things. If you see 'em, keep your mouth covered. Otherwise they'll go straight down it. All right?
Shit. You're kidding me. Nope. BRENDA Brenda! GRANT Hell, you were --
Fuck lucky. Never marry a damn half--Mexican.
Shut up.
Brought you munchies.
What can I do you for?
How many you need?
That's disrespectful.
My present?
Okay.
It's just one of my students, Grant.
Heh. It ain't as bad as it looks, sugarplum. Dr. Carl was just here. I had a reaction to a bee sting. He gave me a prescription. Said I should be fine, in a couple days.
An animal that doesn't procreate. It spreads, grows. A living disease.
Hey, look!
Your what?
America's bored.  Now, what do you want?
All sound reasons for matrimony.
I gotta get back to Atlanta in thirteen hours.
I never looked at it that way.  You ask a lot of questions.
A what?
Yeah, I do. Especially from that angle.
Would I lie to you?
We're cool. The dumb schmuck took the wrong turn.
You know, you're not a bad passenger.
Eleven.
You could've asked.
Nice meeting you, Cledus. Keep on truckin'.
Do I know? I'm an authority on it.
You take the front, I'll take the back.
Forget it. This is one of the longest relationships I've ever had. I'm not blowing it now.
And?
That man is your father?!?
You gotta admire the man's determination.
I want you to know I'm doing this against my better instincts.
I'll do it.
You sure do.
Couple of cheeseburgers, no condiments...
How'd you know?
I don't know, man. Ask him?
Running blocker.
Redneck heaven.
Shouldn't we pay 'em for the damages?
This is Bandit I, come back.
What's your twenty?
I'm at marker eight-five.
You okay?
It's gonna be close. Real close.
Go head on, breaker.
What's up, Dixie Chicken?
See, running Coors Beer east of Texas is what bothers me. It makes me a bootlegger.
You pass that funky Cobra on the highway?
Believe me, that won't be a problem.
Yes, ma'am.
That's the point, Dickey.
Congratulations. You just became a legend maker.
-- Road looks clean as a hound's tooth.
-- Yeah, I heard. But they won't hold him for long. Anyway, he sure gave them sumbitches a run for their money.
And everybody, all the time. Yeah, it's a chore.
No. And I want to be in that room a half second after Mecklen calls to say the deal's done. We've got a sheriff's task force on stand-by.
Yeah, uh -- it was Spanish-somethin' Garcia, or Diego, uh --
-- he was wearing one of our jackets.
Shoot, I appreciate that man.
That's not possible. I told you.
Jack, if the rumors hold and Israel is really the great white whale of snitches, then the mob is looking to put all kinds of bullets into his ass and pour some serious psychotics into the mix to do just that. So what real incentive is there to track him on something as small-time as a skip trace, when it's putting you and yours in the path of severe pain and suffering and an almost certain prelude to doom.
I left him a message.
Cinnamon roll? No, good guess though. No, Hugo that looks like jizz...  And I'm no forensic expert mind you, but that looks like some fuckhead shot their load on a twelve-thousand dollar calf's skin jacket. The twist? It's My twelve thousand dollar, calf's skin jacket.  So y'got semen, human ejaculate --  -- that's been allowed to soak in for what, six, seven hours now? Work it's way into the fabric-fuck'n fibers -- and while you may never see it in a Tide commercial, I think it still safely qualifies as a "tough, deep down stain."
Without peer?
...See, this is one'a them rare moments when y'ass get a chance to be completely honest... and if I'm asking you what you said to Mecklen, assume the shit is rhetorical... so assume I already know.
That's Mecklen. The deal's closing. I can pick that phone up and I can work this out.  You'll walk with me.
-- and you're gonna feel altogether fucked, by me, if you don't handle this. I'm the one, does the face plant, this falls apart, not you.
-- will be handled back in --
-- Brought against Sparazza by Israel's mother Laverne who was nineteen at the time. They had a brief affair which Israel was the by- product of.
Primo Sparazza was Heller's alias. He went deep cover in 1940 and stayed under for over ten years, amassing materials against the mafia and other criminal syndicates. He may have ripped the organization wide open, pre-Appalachia, but his superiors were convinced that he had gone rogue, swapped allegiances...So they gave the order to terminate his cover.
No... It's not.  What it lacks... is an end.
Nah, nuthin' on my end --
I'm here.
-- okay, g'head --
Mmm-hmm... and your boy very well mighta been one of 'em.
I'mma grip and rip girl.  I got some handloads here ready to cut heads.
The try t'wild out on my boo and it's on and crackin'! I'm layin' niggas out.
I ain't tryin' to break a sweat for that sorry ass nigga.
No, but that definitely sounds like shots and I don't where it's comin' from --
...What are they doin' right now...?
He said that the shit could get hot, could get heavy... I said good.  'Cuz I got two of the hottest, heaviest bitches alive.
What do you want?
A puppet.
Yes.
Whose side are you on?
How quickly?
Oh, that's a relief.
My wife.
Will she come back?
Why?
-- we are not sure of that.  We are not sure we aren't all hallucinating.
But why is it doing what it's doing? Given it's resources, it could have done anything.  Presented me with your double, and you with mine.
Get out --
Her oxygen would have run out.
I'll go with you.
I'll be right back.
Book?
Intelligent beyond our comprehension.
I been thinking about how much I hate you.
I did too.
How could she not be real?  I can smell her, taste her.  She does exactly what she did... it's not possible.
You don't love me.
It's all right.
Rheya --
Then you won't make it.
I want you here.
You exist here.  I keep telling you.
Who are you, then?
I want to stop taking those pills.
Why do you say that?
Gibarian was helpless.  It's very simple: Man created the science that resulted in the discovery of Solaris, and the ship that brought us here.
Fuck me.  I knew it.
You go ahead.  Of what I remember about Earth... it's all one thing now.  Everything's a blur.  I like distinctions.
I have to pick something up before Bergdorf's closes, then stop at a reception just a few blocks away.
There's a phone in the car.
Queens... You know Queens?
Beg pardon?
Listen, that was my fault.
Sooner, the better.
I saw you with a dog, in my mind.
But "nice".
Claire, will you calm down?
Oh, I'm fine.  They've replaced you with quite an entourage.  It's a regular "marching band".  You should see me on the street, you'd think I was the First Lady --
I don't know.  Garber's left orders here not to let you in the building.
I don't know...
Just putting in an appearance then.
Sure we are, let's go!
I'm all right.
You got no idea...
Not great.  I've got a babysitting job for a material witness on a homicide.
'Til they pick up the perp.  Seniority gets day shift... You know what that means.
I might stop you.
She didn't like the other one, so she picked this one.
She bought it.
Take it easy!  I set her up.  I saw it coming.
What're you talking about --
I watched TV.
I don't remember Michael, go to sleep.  You don't have to make conversation with me.
What about Tommy?
No.
I'm all right.
I just sat and listened.
If she identifies him.  Where the fuck were you anyway, cowboy!  Venza was meat.  He walked right past you, and now we're the ones playing catch-up!  You better hope she identifies him.
Bad fuckin' news.  Even the families dropped him when they found they had a fruitcake on their hands.  But he knows where a lot of bodies are buried.  It'd cap it for Garber if he could bring him in.
Do it, or look for another profession.  That's a choice I guess.
Yeah!  Seniority gets the day shift.
Be happy.  He's good at this.
Erect.  You know, a "boner?"  I'd heard that it gives you a boner, to shoot a man.
I brought the girl.  She's outside.
She trusts me.  She'll do what I say.
I'll take his place, all right?  Put the gun to my head.
I know where everything is.
Yeah, I think so.
She met some friend of Aunt Millie's who works for a record company.  He thinks she's got a great voice.
No, I'm not coming in.  And if you'd rather go to a "singing lesson" than have dinner with your father...
Shooting?
I don't think she can sing, either.
Oh, beware of jealousy, my lord, the green-eyed monster...
Peter Parker, you have no idea what I did this weekend.  Or didn't do. It's no business of yours either way.
I know.
No, no, listen. They're tryin' to say he was in cahoots with this killer--
I saw him too.  He was silly and obnoxious.
Hm.  What a lump.
They'll never take me alive.
Let me guess.  The hunting dogs. You lost your scholarship.
Why home? The real world beckons, man!  The possibilities are endless.  Want to go up to the World Trade Center and laugh at New Jersey?
Don't be pitiful.
Mm-hmm.
Can I get a word in edgewise?
Police, help!  Po-- mmph.
Sorry. I'm still getting the hang of this.
Just about.  See, I also have this amazing strength.
He knew.
Huh?
But you like that in a man?
Does it have a human name?
Hi, Adele.
This from a girl who still plays with dolls.
That was then.  I'm better since the lobotomy.
I'm here...
So you've found Thorkel?
Precise equipment? such as waldos?
You were adorable.  The least you could do is use a glass.
Power down.  I need to talk to you.
I don't care.  Cretin.
Actually, I got this spider bite?
No, thank you.  I'm sure you've got your own problems.
Oh. Yeah.  Thanks.
I was hoping you'd call, babe. Look, you got representation?
Good. We'll make it oral for now. Meet me at Rockefeller Center at six tonight.
Yup.  Oh, here's your check, minus my commission.  Solid, solid novelty act.
And blow up the universe just to prove he's right?  Bit egotistical, isn't it?
Bonkers.
No, but I've got this secret identity to worry about. I'll swing the rest of the way.
I wouldn't talk about things like that.
Is you all little Adolfs?
Any news on Dunbar?
Take some matches, see?  And a cigarette, see?  Tuck the cigarette in like this, see?  Now the cigarette keeps burning like a fuse, see?
Static!
Coming up.
Maybe it's going to be a longer war than you figured -- eh, Duke?
Ask Security.  You tell him, Price. You've got me shadowed every minute of the day. Or haven't you found out yet?
And maybe a little something else?
Let's get on with what? What is this anyway? A Kangaroo Court? Why don't you get a rope and do it right?
You're all wire happy, boys. You've been in this camp too long. You put two and two together and it comes out four. Only it ain't four.
Forget it.
Tipping me off? I do not understand.
Sefton!
Yeah.
What are the chances busting out of here?
I didn't do it -- I didn't do it.
They also smell of moth balls.  When were they issued? This morning?
Perfectly all right. I do not like boots.
Raus! Raus! All of you!
It's a mouse trap.
Why do you do this to me every morning?
Let go, Animal! It's roll call! Hitler wants to see you!
I'm telling you, Animal -- these Nazis ain't Ko --
Comrade! Comrade! Otchi Tchorniya -- Otchi Tchorniya!
I don't care if they wear galoshes!
Let me go!
What's the award?
You're teasing me again!
No?
What do they always say?
Do Jimmy Durante!
It's that song, Harry!
There's a time in every man's life when he wants to be alone! So go away!
Why, sure!
You want to go?
Yes, sir.
Curtains would do wonders for this barrack.  You will not get them.
Wait a second, Hoffy. Schulz says he's our best friend. Maybe he can give us a little hint.
Come on, everybody!  Let's go!
With your mother's pull, how come you're not a chicken colonel by now?
You told them, Hoffy.
You did!
You betcha. There ought to be some reward money from Mama. Say ten thousand bucks worth.
Let's synchronize the watches. Eleven forty-two, sharp.
Just what makes you so popular?
What about the radio?
Thirty-fifth.
Are you questioning me?
Where. Up Joey's ocarina. Didn't you know?
Maybe just one word? Kaput? Because you're kaput, Price.
All right, gentlemen, I will find it myself. Now let's see.
Who's the other wrestler? The one with the mustache?
We'll put pink ribbons on the bedbugs.
We'll consider it a prisoner exchange.
Where is he?
Thanks for pointing that out.
When is it expected back?
No, sir. I am finding it difficult to concentrate. I believe I am overwhelmed with feelings of remorse and regret concerning my actions on the observatory.
But I did not deal with it, sir. I let it prevent me from helping my friend.  Does that make me a coward?
Can you project its course?
I believe so.
Yes, sir. There are two in the Veridian system.
Approximately two hundred thirty million.
I have to find a way to get to Soran.
It appears to be a magnetically sealed.
One minute to warp core breach.
All hands, brace for impact!
There's some buckling on the starboard nacelle.  We've also got a hull breach in the Engineering section. Emergency forcefields are in place and holding.
You're in the Nexus.
Enjoy them, Jean-Luc.
All of us.
Why would you want to leave?
Yes, where would you go?
I can't leave. I'm already there, remember?
It's our pleasure.
Yes, yes, it is.
I'm from what you would consider the future; the 24th-century.
Not exactly. As I said, this is some kind of-
You could say that.
I've warned ye about that back of yours. You should have a doctor take a look at it.
And what would that be, sir?
A photon torpedo?
Load torpedo bays, prepare to fire on my command.
I was ordered to by the Captain.
I told you everything. You might as well just kill me right now.
Understood. That will be all.
No. Thank you.
They're just trying to decide whether a twenty year-old Klingon Bird of Prey is any match for the Federation flagship.
You may still. Somehow I doubt this will be the last ship to carry the name Enterprise.
Very well. I suppose I could make out my weekly report to Starfleet Command without your input.  "Admiral Lusby, regarding the unusual behavior of Jean-Luc Picard: I find him increasingly irritable, remote and uncooperative. I recommend forced shore leave at a Starbase facility in order to-"
What I can't get out of my mind is the image of Rene- my nephew. I just can't believe he's gone.
In a way, he was as close as I ever came to having a child of my own.
My brother had shouldered that burden, allowing me to pursue my own selfish needs.
Mr. Data, scan the planet for lifeforms.
The thought had crossed my mind.
What if I told you I found a new truth?
Why were they looking for it on a Federation observatory? It doesn't make any sense.
Lock phasers and return fire!
And we are gaining... Stand by, tractor beam!
Yes, sir, I sealed the room myself. Nevertheless -- I am reading a life form there.
Mr. Scott, we need everything you've got now.
Could be Grissom.  Patch in the hailing frequency.  U.S.S. Grissom, this is Enterprise calling. Come in, please.
It has to be. Gravitational fields were in flux... It must have soft landed...!
Thank you... <u>Sir</u>!
... Fascinating.
You must be very proud of what you and your mother have created.
Underground deposit?
There's only one thing it could be... Short range scan.
Grissom, your message acknowledged. Will advise... Out.
It would seem that Grissom was destroyed by an enemy attack.
Not exactly.
Pon Farr. Vulcan males must endure it every seventh year of their adult life.
Affirmative, Captain. Our readings are well below danger level.
Request permission to beam aboard immediately.
Aye, those two hits should stop a horse, let alone a bird.
He gave his life to save us. That is all I know.
Goodbye, David.
And if they don't.? What will Happen to Spock?
Much is at stake...
The word is no.  I am therefore going anyway.
Aye, sir, Warp Speed...
What about Grissom, Mr. Chekov?
What about surface life signs...?
Come on!
Welcome home, Jim.
Indisposed, sir.
Genesis?! Whatever for?
Then let me speak to the Council! Harry, <U>please</U>! I can <U>make</U> them understand!!
Admiral, your young friend is mistaken. I meant what I said. And now, to show my intentions are sincere... I am going to kill one of the prisoners.
"Met his death"?  How could you, his friend, have assumed that? Why did you leave him on Genesis! Spock trusted you -- and you denied him his future!
... Yes...
... No...! ` Kirk, bathed with sweat, suddenly shudders in pain. Sarek opens his eyes, removes his hands. He touches Kirk with gentleness as Jim recovers, opens his eyes.
But he couldn't touch me...! We were separated!
One alive, one not. Yet both in pain.
You must bring them to Mount Selaya -- on Vulcan. Only there is the passage possible. Only there can both find peace...
I am not sure. Only time will answer.  Kirk. I thank you. What you have done is --
Wait!... Wait...

I underestimated him... He did the one thing I didn't anticipate ... He destroyed himself...
This isn't reality. This is fantasy.
I was not attempting to evaluate its moral implications, Doctor. As a matter of cosmic history, it has always been easier to destroy than to create --
I don't dispute that in the wrong hands --
But, as you are so fond of observing, Doctor, I'm not human.
I'm afraid I can't stop to discuss this logically --
Four hundred years old. You don't find many with the lens still intact.
And who am I hiding from?
The inspection will continue once we're underway, Doctor.
As a physician you of all people should appreciate the danger of re-opening old wounds.
He's BEEN there and hasn't found what he wants. Can you spare someone? There may be people hurt.
Where <u>they</u> went. Saavik.
It's like the Garden of Eden...
And almost got tossed out of the Academy...
En route? Why? We weren't expecting you for another three months. Has something happened?  <u>Has something happened</u>? Do you read us?
I know, I know...
I don't think there's another piece of information we could squeeze into the memory banks. Next time, we'll design a bigger one.
Starfleet has kept the peace for a hundred years, I cannot and will not subscribe to your interpretation of this event.
Never mind! Hurry!
Marooned on Ceti Alpha V. He's completely mad, Admiral. He blames you for the death of his wife...
There is some pain at first, I am told, and then the effects are quite benign -- until the end. That was what I learned from watching my wife.
Then to whom do you report directly regarding Genesis?
No. I -- I guess I'm not what you expected.
Only half of you would get there.
It's not much different from Enterprise.  When I was a guest aboard her some years ago, Captain Kirk kindly allowed me to memorize her technical manuals. And now, Mr. Chekov, let us review: You say you have no details of Project 'Genesis' ?
Let them eat static.
Warp drive still inoperative. All other systems should be restored shortly.
Rake her.
I've given you no word to keep, Admiral. In my judgment, you simply have no alternative.
Listen to me -- you men and women --
Aye, sir.
A few shots, sir.
I'm going down to the station.
Uhura, send to Commander, Reliant: prepare to be boarded.
Picture, Mr. Saavik.
Admiral --
We'll beam aboard. Alert transporter room --
My sister's youngest, Admiral. Crazy to get to space.
The word is given: warp speed.
To be sure, Captain.
That is wise. In any case, were I to invoke logic, logic clearly dictates that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.
How far?
Chekov's on Reliant, isn't he?
Who the <u>hell</u> are they?
Wait for my signal, Spock -- too soon and he'll have time to figure it out and raise them again.
Engine room... Scotty, do we have enough power for the transporters?
Best we could do in two hours.
She can out-run us and out-gun us. But there is the Mutara Nebula at 153 mark four.
Yes, sir.
Prayer, Mr. Saavik. The Klingons do not take prisoners.  Captain.
There is no correct resolution. It is a test of character.
Energize defense fields.
Who?
Phasers on stun. Move out.
As your teacher Mr. Spock is fond of saying: I like to think there always are possibilities.
At what.
Phasers locked...
Inform the Klingons we are on a rescue mission...
Never, sir.
Lieutenant, the Admiral is aware of the Regulations.
By the book...
Then you stand here alive because of a mistake -- made by your flawed, feeling, human friends. They have sacrificed their futures because they believed that the good of the <u>one</u> -- you -- was more important to them.
Fine. Just fine.
Yeah.
I don't know about you, but my compassion for someone is not limited to my estimate of their intelligence.  I mean whales may not have painted the Mona Lisa or invented the dirt bike but they didn't ravish the land either.
Not at all. You gave me things to think about. You always do. You do sound a little wrecked, why don't you go home and stare at the ceiling?
What do you mean?
No way -- somebody has to keep an eye on him!
If you have a better idea - now's the time.
Let's hope so, Bones. Mr. Sulu, set us down in Golden Gate Park.
... My shoes...
My God, man, drilling holes in his head is not the answer. The artery must be repaired without delay or he will die! So put away your butcher knives and let me save the patient!
It gives me a great sense of danger. We have to beam in next to the reactor room, not in it.
Like what?
I'm wery sorry, but --
I'm impressed, Mr. Chekov. A lot of effort for a short voyage.
Most prudent.  Engine room. Report, Scotty.
Mr. President, the Probe has passed through all quadrants. The starships Shepard and Yorktown and three smaller vessels have been neutralized.
Is there something wrong with the one I have?
Why's that?
How soon?
LDS?? Are you dyslexic on top of everything else? Come on, Lemme give you a lift. I have a notorious weakness for hard luck cases -- that's why I work with whales.
Go ahead.
Well, that's something. I'da let you off right here.
Implicitly.
Just lucky, I guess.
They'll be flown in a special 747 to Alaska and released there.
If you have such a low opinion of my abilities, how come we're having dinner?
What's what?
All right. The truth?
It wouldn't be my first choice, no.
Kirk. They're gone.
They were taken last night. I wasn't told. They're in Alaska by now.
You're going to your ship, I'm going to mine. Science Vessel. I've got 300 years of catch-up learning to do.
Well, I... find that understandable  I mean, you've been through a lot.  Station, please.
To the on-board computer room. To confirm my suspicion.
As suspected, the Probe's transmissions are the songs sung by whales.
Explain.
You mean profanity. That's simply the way they talk here. Nobody pays any attention to you if you don't swear every other word. You'll find it in all the literature of the period.
Admiral, if we were to assume these. whales are ours to do with as we please, we would be as guilty as those who caused their extinction.
Yes?
The tank will be finished by morning...
In that event, the probabilities are that our mission would fail.
Admiral, you must wait one damn minute.
We'll divide into teams. Commanders Chekov and Uhura are assigned to the Uranium problem.
Uhura, scan for the whales. 401 megahertz!
Picture, Uhura!
Overlapping distress calls. Some from Starships... others...
From a city? That doesn't make sense....
Right.  Now look: I want you all to be very careful. This is terra incognita. Many customs will doubtless take us by surprise. It's a forgone conclusion these people have never seen an extra-terrestrial before.
On screen.
Mr. Scott -- how soon?
Two?
Give me a round figure, Mr. Scott.
Mr. Sulu?
Well done, Mr. Scott. How soon can we be ready for warp speed?
Mr. Sulu, if you please.
It's under water! There's no way to reach it...
Thank you, Lt. Saavik.
We deny nothing! We have the right to preserve our race!
That's easy: 6 inches. We carry stuff that big in stock.
That's the ticket, laddie.
Hi. Huey 205, isn't it?
Oh, here and there.  I flew something similar in my Academy days.
Tell her I feel fine...
Your directive apparently doesn't include spying on other cultures.
Capability, yes. But where can warp drive take us, except away from here...?
Then you must spend your life answering questions.
To move you off this planet. You go to sleep one night in your village... wake up the next morning in this flying holodeck transported en masse. A week later, maybe a month, you've been relocated on a similar planet without ever realizing it.
You don't live up to your reputation as an offlander, Picard.
... who wouldn't be tempted by the promise of perpetual youth? I don't think so.
Yes. Exactly. Nothing more complicated than perception.  You explore the universe. We've discovered a single moment in time can be a universe in itself... full of powerful forces... most people aren't aware enough of the now... to ever notice them...
It took us centuries to learn that it doesn't have to take centuries to learn.
I just... haven't gotten around to it yet.
What's the rush?
This way!
I play the violin... and my chess routines are quite advanced...
Bye.
'Yew-cheen chef-faw'... My collar size is exactly the same as it was at the Academy.
Your Captain used to cut quite a rug...
Is it safe to move her?
What's the last thing you remember, Data...
What you're seeing is a computer driven image created by photons and forcefields...
What possible purpose could a duplicate village have except... to deceive the Ba'ku...
It is not over.
That's probably not a good idea. Your ship hasn't been fitted for this region; there are environmental concerns...
We haven't fully identified the anomalies yet. They're calling this whole area The Briar Patch... it took us a day to reach a location where we could get a signal out to you. Just get me Data's schematics. I'll keep you informed.  Dougherty out.
Understood.
... or understand that they were participating in the outright theft of a world.  I won't let you move them, Admiral. I'll go to the Federation Council...
Who are we to decide the next course of evolution for these people?
Someone probably said the same thing about the Romulans a century ago.
If a court-martial is the only way to tell the people of the Federation what happened here, then I welcome it.
There's nothing further to be gained from this...
Do you know how to disable the injector?
No, sir. But it wasn't easy... being among them...
Recommendations?
No one hated them more than you, Gal'na.  We've come a long way together. This is the moment we've planned for so many years...
So, you're saying he still knew the difference between right and wrong.
The manifold can't handle full impulse in the Patch, Commander.
I'll be in Engineering.
How long 'til they reach us?
Cometary debris, pockets of unstable metreon gas... we don't want to go in there, sir...
We're through running from these bastards.
Sir?
Prepare to enter the atmosphere... we'll use the ionospheric boundary to shake him...
No, sir. I haven't had a chance to meet all the new crew members since I've been back...
No, sir. It is a gorch.
Accelerated hair growth is often experienced by Klingons during Jak'tahla...
Decloak the holo-ship and engage a tractor beam, Mister Worf.
Can you beam him off?
Say the greeting again...
You should feel right at home with them.
What...?
Was I doing something to your neck?
No children?
But it's comfortable.
Or you could try lying down.
I'm afraid so. If the Borg succeed in preventing First Contact with the Vulcans... Earth will remain in the Second Dark Age... an easy target when the Borg arrive in the 24th century.
I've stabilized him for now... but he's in a coma and he's going to need radiometric therapy. I want to take him to the ship.
It may not be that simple. This is an extremely difficult and paranoid time in human history.
Let's hope so. Because if Cochrane dies... the future may die with him.
If they're not... we'd better get used to living in Montana.
Bag him.
I'm a little worried about some of these bone fragments. If they move any closer to the brain, we could be looking at a hemorrhage.
It would appear that you are attempting to graft organic skin onto my endo-skeletal structure.
They're not your friends... they've held you back... kept you from your destiny...
My creator did not intend for me to experience these things.
A universe of sensation is waiting for you... don't you want to explore it... with me?
Then take the final step... give me the Enterprise... and we can be together... always.
I believe so.
Go to impulse. Where's the Borg ship?
Where's the Sphere?
I am the beginning... the end. I am the one who is many. I am the Borg.
But how?
I told you, there's no --
How serious is the damage?
It could be the radiation, Captain. Try from the surface.
If there are other photographs... I think I may know how to find them.
Then we'll just have to assume it's still there...
As they used to say... all systems are go.
One minute to warp threshold...
Picard to Enterprise.  Picard to Enterprise -- do you read me?
Well, I feel a whole lot better with them out there. We may need some help.
I've enhanced the plasma injectors -- don't worry, they'll see it.
You don't sound French.
Oh... here and there. You know how it is.
There's a few of us left.
Yes, he is.
You're not someone who lies very easily... so it's obvious when you do... at least to me.
I have to...
Intercept course, full impulse.  Weapons status?
They did it... they assimilated Earth.
Assign another team if you need to. I want to re-establish communication with the Captain as soon as possible.
They're converting the deflector dish into an antennae...
We've lost Bridge control!
Nothing.
What are you suggesting?
Something is very wrong, Commander. We're falling back.
Commander... we have a problem.
There were no planetary defense systems in this era. Their weapons were designed to fight each other... not extraterrestrials.
Data's positronic net contains classified information on the Enterprise. Command codes, security protocols...
The longer we wait, the less accessible the hostages will be, Mr. President.
I'm going too. They may need a doctor.
You may need assistance, doctor...
What's the Brotherhood of Aliens?
I didn't mean this future.
Some people ARE afraid of the future; of what MIGHT happen;  I was frightened, really frightened.
Still think we're finished?
That cunning little Vulcan...
She didn't need our help getting anywhere... where did she get these convenient clothes? And don't tell me that flare is standard prison issue...
And perhaps with a large step or two. Like a peace treaty.
You were incompetent! - whether deliberately or as a result of age combined with drink this court will determine.
I don't mind. Smuggling. Guilty. I come from Arc. Smuggling is an ancient and respected trade there.
I'm not sure how to take that.
You feign ignorance?
You crippled our gravitational field with a direst torpedo hit, and two Starfleet crewmen beamed aboard in magnetic boots and did this! WE HAVE WITNESSES!
He just tried to save him!
Isn't it a fact that you served Romulan ale, a beverage illegal in the Federation because of its overwhelming potency?
I checked the data banks, yes.
Yes.
I cannot confirm or deny actions which I did not witness.
Your honors, the State rests.
I know what you mean...
Uhura, monitor!
First rule of assassination: always kill the assassins.
But if she's cloaked...
They must have walked through it when it was floating and tracked it back here.
ALL uniforms?
Do we report this, sir?
Uh, would you and your party care to dine this evening aboard Enterprise with my officers as guests of the United Federation of Planets?
We didn't kill Gorkon.
Where do we come in?
Captain, if --
Come on, Saavik, you COULD knock -
I won't allow Starfleet to be dismantled over some Klingon promises.
You hear that?
I was asked by my father to open neg-
We've fired on the Chancellor's ship -
I'M going. You are going to be responsible for getting me out of this. Meantime we're not going to be the instigators of a full-scale war on the eve of universal peace.
Why would they give them to us?
You were right: it was arrogant presumption that got us into this situation. You might have died.
Control, this is Enterprise requesting permission to depart.
Faith...?
What do you suggest, Lieutenant? Opening fire won't retrieve the Captain; and an armed engagement was precisely what he wished to avoid.
A lie?
We've got a crew of three hundred turning their own quarters inside out,  but the killers may be among them. Surely they've disposed of these boots by now. Wouldn't it have been logical to leave them on Gorkon's ship?
An error.
We are experiencing a technical malfunction. All backup systems inoperative.
What?
You having hearing problems, mister?
Fifty-four planets - and their gaseous atmospheric anomalies. Our sensing and analytic equipment worked well.
What is it?
Aye, aye, sir.
What exactly does that mean?
Well, what about all that atmospheric equipment we're carrying to catalogue gaseous anomalies?
I am in a room with lights.
No, I have only activated your cognitive and communication subroutines.
No.
About twenty-five years ago. They probably used a hair follicle or skin cell.
To happy endings.
Will and Deanna joining the Titan. Dr. Crusher going to Starfleet Medical...
You never know what's over the horizon, Data. Before too long you'll be offered a command of your own.
Now, you make a toast.
Thank you, Data.  Let's see what she can do.
I can see that.
We'll find a way off together. Recommendations?
Of you?
This is not an appropriate time for a conversation.
How many of you did Dr. Soong make?
I can't believe the Captain went along with a memory download.
Why is it moving?
I would like to pick you up now. May I do that?
The least I could do for you, Deanna.  Besides, you know me... I'm a talking head.
You're speaking of emotional investment?
As much as we care for him, Deanna... we have to remember that Data isn't capable of disappointment.
Make it so.
Deanna Troi of Betazed. Empathic and telepathic abilities, ship's counselor. All of this I knew... But I didn't know you were so beautiful.
This is Commander Donatra of the Valdore. We're dispatching shuttles with medical personnel and supplies.
What do we know about the population?
He wants to look me in the eye.

Understood.
Just lucky, Admiral.
Praetor Shinzon, I'm pleased to...
There'll be another after me. And another after that. You'll find we're a resilient species.
Come now, a big, strapping fellow like you? What are you afraid of?
What sort of signature?
Who was it?
Your new chair, sir.
I appreciate your concern, Number One, but I've been itching to try out the Argo.
A coup d'etat?
Counselor?
She's a predator.
When your first officer insists that you can't go on away missions... Ignore him.
The honor was mine. Captain Riker.
I've never met a human woman.
Praetor Shinzon. We're not here to discuss your lack of a social life.
You know I do.
I know.
Yes. The eyes have it.
You're doing this to liberate the Remans?
New worlds.
What's this all about?
I'm incapable of such an act, and so are you.
You know that's not possible.
Look at me, Shinzon! Do you feel the blood pumping inside you? Your hands, your eyes, your nature, are the same as mine. Buried deep inside you beneath the years of pain and anger is a capacity you've forgotten. It's the one way our mirror can reflect the two of us exactly because it's the very thing that truly defines us. To be human is to try to make yourself better than you are.
He is what his life has made him!
Please.
Should I raise shields?
They're holding position.
You don't have to understand.
I have a purpose.

For the moment.
There is. They came out of the belly of the ship and then went to the first terrace and flew down into the houses.
No, we can handle this.
I don't think so... 
I'll have to run your card off now.
Thank you.
Stay right there...
Elmo's...
It's a copy of the plaque NASA sent into space on the Pioneer probes.
Is there any possibility that it's a hoax? Could you be mistaken?
We'll get those answers when you find the one you're looking for.
We've been back and forth on this all day and keeping in mind the panic that would occur if this got to the general public, it's been decided not to expand the search at this time.
George, listen to what you're saying. This thing's changed itself into a man. Disappearing may not be that big a deal.
Shermin...
We have a new directive. I'm taking over.
No, we don't.
You're a career intelligence officer, Shermin. You'll be in the air with us.
You can speak to me, Mrs. Haydn. I'm in charge of this operation now.
I told you. He let me go. I'm on my way home.
Don't... don't do this... please...
What.
Good.
Money.
We're going to have to stop for gas soon.
No gas.
It's closed... closed. We need one that's open.
I am...
I know.
No. I don't know what you are, but you're not Scott.
Oh God! You're going to get us both killed. Okay... in your pocket...
No.
Candy.
This stuff could kill...  Be my guest.
Yes. Day... night.
A baby is a new person?
But I speak English.
'Las Vegas, please. I do not speak English.' What is hitchhike?
Can I have the gun?
Yes.
Goodbye.
Yes?
The captain wanted to land to see close and to get some things from Earth to take home. The police came and shot at us. One of the people from my ship was killed.
What is hell?
Are you my friend?
Yes.
Yes. Sing some more.
I'm not sleepy anymore. Let's drive for a little while longer.
No. I'm just not tired. Let's go.
Come on.
I feel better if I move.
Do they talk?!
I know how to gamble now.
This is very interesting. We are born knowing our history. We have other books. But not a book like this.
I understand.
If you want to keep it, you can.
Where?
Hey, she doesn't want to go with you. Come on.
My grandmother's rich.
In the cars, too?!
This is going to be a real drag. I thought you wanted to go fast.
Pull over. I've got to get back there.
Bell wants us to get down on our knees and bow.
We're ready.
Then why did they try and sneak in the back door? Tell me that. Why didn't they contact us first and say...
Very beautiful country up here...
Not on the landscape. We're trying to get a tube under the faceplate for a reading on possible deadly lifeforms but it's hard going.
Was there visual contact?
Twenty-eight years.
It was kind of like clicking, maybe a language wasn't it?
It was the husband. The police finally got a hold of the witness at work and showed him a picture of the woman.
Parlez vous Francais?... Habla Ingles?... Sprechen zie deutsch?
I don't understand.
No.
Okay cash!  Logical.  Here's everything I have on me, what do you say?  How about a Rolex?
What's all this squid shit?
Yeah, right.
Joey, make sure Mr. Nero gets safely to his car.
A tragic story, no doubt.  How'd you get up here?
Take her up to the suite.  Have a glass of champagne... or six... I'll be up in a while to help you ring in the New Year.
What're you going to do?
I'm not.  Just a little poach job.
Too bad about your guy Jeriko. Tough break.
I know.  Lenny, if Tran finds you talking to me he'll hurt you.
Yeah, OK, whatever you say.  Just answer one question.  Is anything wrong?  Iris said you might be in trouble.
Tonight.
What?  He gonna record you on his label?
Can't do it.
Tell me.
We should talk alone.
Yeah... he figured out what to do all right.
I'll set you up, get you a deck at my cost... since my thing is the software.
Least you can do.
Thanks, Max.
Hey, Iris, you okay?
I figured, what the hell, I could take the prick's money and make sure Faith was OK at the same time.  Do us both good.  Right?
He records himself raping and killing her--
He makes her see her own death, feeds off the reaction... killer and victim merging... orgasm and agony merging.  And he records it all.
W'sup, Max?
You may be a little overdressed for this party.  Yo, Tick!  It's Lenny.  Open up!
Smoke.  Rumors.  I've heard stuff about a death squad.  A group a guys loyal to the hardline school.  Guys that've had too many years of city hall and the review boards and the goddamn media pissing down their necks, suspending cops right and left, tying their hands... while outa the other side a their mouths these same people're squealing save us, save us, do something you fucking morons, crime is totally out of control.
Okay... what about Strickland?
What do you mean?
I intend to.
Only way I could stand your ties.
Where's Faith?
You bet.  Did you like it?
You must be so pleased, I followed your jellybean trail right here, like a good little chump.
Uh huh.  Look, Nero.  I'll make you an offer.  Take her.  Right now.  If she wants to go, if she's unhappy here, she can go.  I'll let her choose.  Faith always knows what she wants.  Hands off.  See?
Strickland.
Mace!  You're a life-saver.
Way I look at it, I actually perform a humanitarian service.  I save lives.
Yeah, but that was for love.
Fumitsu.
Let's talk in the car.
Get it.
I've had it.  No more wirehead shit in my car.  You understand?  You want to poach your lobes, do it somewhere else.
No, you're just trying to get off.
She still loves me.
I have crawled through the gutter... through every wrinkle in the human brain.
Go to the Sunset Sheraton.  RIGHT NOW!  Just go!  GO!
Snuff clip.  It was Iris.  She said she needed my help and I... aw Jesus, Mace... the sick fucker killed her.
This guy is someone you know, one of your squid-head contacts.
So some psycho wire-freak gets to keep running around--
You ever wonder why you get beat up a lot?
Yeah.  I'm ghosting pretty bad.
Because Iris knew somebody was after her.
Mace, the guy had a knife.  To my throat.  In my living room. Relaxing might be right out, okay?!
It's in my case.  Okay?  I'm going to open my case...
Take it easy.  The glass is bullet resistant.
I can't tell you.  You've got to see.
I see.  I see the earth opening up and swallowing us all.
Well, look at the plus side.
Yeah.  You gave up your hot tub tape to save me.  That's real progress for you.
Yeah, right, blow it open.
And it didn't stop you from wanting to protect them.  Did it?
You never told me.
Exactly.  That's why it's a make- able deal.
A cop?  You want me to trust a cop?!
Naw.  They just have to ask us a few questions... for about six hours.
Just Lenny.
Are you going to make me beg?
The bearded guy, the creep. Oh, one other thing. Testa, if that's his name, he kept mentioning my feet. Said I had very pretty feet.
Zorro. Yes, ran it through my files, even asked around: came up completely blank. Thought there might be a Mexico connection, El Paso and all, but nothing. Fooled around with the letter "Z," turned it on it's side, got "N" -- there Ng, he's Vietnamese. The only thing that came to mind was zero, not Zorro. Remember Suspect Zero?
I'm babysitting the DEA guys this afternoon, Casio and I. You said that was top priority.
Well, the victim was killed at the turn-around over there, then his car was pushed over here...  ...right across the state line. That makes it Federal. This is Officer Wallace, he's out of Alamogordo.
That's right, Jan.
You're thinking...?
This isn't in our database?
No bad news. You know the Be On the LookOut you asked me to send on the diner car -- we got a hit on it. A little town on the border, Socorro. We got it staked out -- you interested?
I sent a female in. The room in question was rented by an Anglo, cash; since then, nothing -- no activity, no phone response.
Sheriff Dylan, this is FBI Agent Thomas Mackelway. Remember me?
I want to talk about the Karen Sumpter case.
She's buried.
Winona.
We need to run this through VICAP, search for similar burns.
It's been customized for sleeping capacity.
Fucking. I'm talking about fucking, Harold. You ever think of fucking other women?
What's wrong with me?
Yes.
He had an orange hat on.
This better be important.
Who?
I was lucky to find, much less crack, the address code -- no way to be sure I could have done it again.
No, just coincidence. He knew who I was, of course. He had my ID -- did he keep it?
What I do requires confidentiality.
Had trouble sleeping last night, sir.
Mack the Mouth at a loss for words.
You suspected all along, suspected he was alive. That's why you came to El Paso.
You knew the arm slash was not "Zorro."
I was looking for a pattern.
In Ft. Myers before your instruction. Nowhere else, sir.
What about Zero, Darryl Hawkins?
There's a killer out there -- we know who he is. He could be stalking now.
The Academy, then CIIAC.
How long have you been downtown?
Yeah, you know the vic's car, he was killed this side of the state line, the car then pushed across the border. This by an Unknown Subject, presumably the killer, who left no fucking evidence except the snapshot, which may or may not have been accidental.
That information's being withheld from the media.
This is some serious shit.
Sex.
What's this country coming to?
I was thinking, maybe we should ask Professor Daitz. Nobody knows this stuff better.
Because you asked him to, stupid.
No. Cut off while he was still alive, look at his wrists, damn near ripped his hands off trying to get free. Must have been screaming real loud when the killer chain-sawed his throat. Unfortunately, he'd soundproofed his van.
We're trying to match them with dump site bodies.  This we know is Carol Delview from Tampa, found her last Spring. This one --
Sue Ann Hanson.
I can't. They trust me, they accept me. I've got their confidence.
You want to get him? Find something he wants. Get him to come to you.
I guess I'm a little paranoid.
Slow down a second, you met with Low --
Does one exist?
I got an autopsy report from El Paso that doesn't seem right. A girl on Low's list. Karen Sumpter. We're getting a court order to exhume to body. I'd like you to come and look at it.  Don't worry, I've cleared it.
Could be a lot of things. Depends on the freezer.  I'm sorry, Mack, but I don't think this is the answer.
That's what Koessler wants us to believe. To discredit Low.
I...
Sit back.
The little piggie speaks.
Yes, sir.
You're a smart guy. Tell me what it says.
The file, however, was kept open after your death. NPE disappearances, No Plausible Explanation, were sometimes filed there, deleted if the bodies were found.
Zero killed them all?
Whatever happened to MyDick?
[Ask for Leslie. Eight days from tonight, exactly one a.m. Be there if you dare. You cannot fool the Murman.]
[I don't think so. We want the same thing. See ya.]
Hot enough for you, Agent Mackelway? Hell's doorknob. What they got you doing?
Murman!
Shit.
You're right. I know.
I don't know about that.
Enough. I've got to use the phone.
You're money, baby.
I know! Starbucks! I served you an espresso at Starbucks.
Yes. Like the quiche.
Tell me about it...
Well, it still sucks, but you start to see that there are advantages to being single.
Why not? This place is dead anyway.
...then ask where you met her...
They were auditioning for the same role as you?
No matter what... like splitting aces.
Actually, it's funny you... I'm actually, uh, between...
Well... You can talk to a beautiful woman at a bar without worrying if anyone's watching you.
If and when I get a real gig I'll call you.
Why, you like the duck with the cigar? 
...The red piece of shit over there...
I heard you might be moving back...
I'm not home and going out of town tomorrow for a week. Can't you talk for five more minutes?
You don't call.
Right.
I mean first you'll pretend not to care, not call -- whatever, and then, eventually, you really won't care.
You're an actor. Find the Zen in the role.
What do you want? You're tall.
I don't know. Eight or Nine.
Wait till summer. I swear, you can't leave the house. It hurts. It physically hurts.
Sue. His dad was big Johnny Cash fan.
..."A Boy Named Sue". I think that's why he's such a bad cat.
Go for it, man.
At least you didn't get turned down for Goofy...
I didn't make it...
Sometimes is still hurts. You know how it is, man. I mean, each day you think about it less and less. And then one day you wake up and you don't think of it at all, and you almost miss that feeling. It's kinda weird. You miss the pain because it was part of your life for so long. And the, boom, something reminds you of her, and you just smile that bittersweet smile.
You always know the right thing to say.
I can't believe you.
Don't sweat it, man. I needed a kick in the ass. We're better friends for it.
Sorry. We got knocked out pretty quickly.
I'll have "pancakes in the Age of Enlightenment".
Hang on, Voltaire.
Trent, I don't feel like going out tonight. I got shit to do tomorrow...
Just bring your card. Half an hour.
What?
Oh... Now Mikey wants to be a high roller.
Be downstairs. You're beautiful.
I'm cool, baby. They're gonna give Daddy a room, some breakfast, maybe Bennett's singing.
You gotta love the pirates, baby. The pirates are money.
Who's fucking around? I'm not making fun. Let's do it, baby.
Thanks for clarifying that.
Let's just leave.
She smiled, baby.
Baby, this is what we came for. We met a beautiful baby and she likes you.
It's not. You're money. Any of these ladies would be lucky to pull a cat like you.
"Age of Enlightenment". Shit. Like some waitress in a Las Vegas coffee shop is going to get an obscure French philosophical reference. How demeaning. I may as well have just said "Let me jump your ignorant bones."...
No! Not the camera guy!
What?
How?
...Whatever. It's work. You're doing what you love. What's she doing?
What? That was the best part of the old game.
Minnie Pearl.
What?
I don't know. It was kind of a dick move if you ask me.
That doesn't matter.
What a surprise.
Don't give me that! She liked you, man.
You could make their heads bleed, though.
...How novel.
No.
What was cold about it?
You're like this big bear with claws and fangs...
...I used to wait two days. Now everyone waits two days. Three days is kinda money now, don't you think?
What'd you want me to do? Back down? He called me a bitch. We kept our rep.
...it is so on.
Six.
Yes. 
Good.  From me you'll get Justice.
I'll come to you when I need you.
OK, OK.  You gonna make me something to eat at least?
How many times did he stay home the last couple of months?
The guy at the gate's outside...says there's a package...
Drive while you thinking; I wanna get to the City this month!
It's too late.  All the contracts have been signed, they're almost ready to shoot.
The Senator called--apologized for not coming personally, but said you'd understand.  Also, some of the Judges...they've all sent gifts. And another call from Virgil Sollozzo.
When did he call?
It's been two years.  He's probably in trouble again.
They'll cut the cake in a few minutes...leave right after that. Your new son-in-law, do we give him something important?
For bravery.
For killing a man.
No.
Then why have I become a man like you?
How did you find out?
Nazorine, my friend, tell me what I can do.
The younger men have no respect. Things are changing; I don't know what will happen.  Michael, because of the wedding, people now know your name.
Yes.
That's for you to find out.
Okay.  One minute.
Without your father's political contacts and personal influence, the Corleone family loses half its strength.  Without your father, the other New York families might wind up supporting Sollozzo, and the Tattaglias just to make sure there isn't a long destructive war.  The old days are over, this is 1946; nobody wants bloodshed anymore.  If your father dies...make the deal, Sonny.
Part of the deal: Bruno cancels out what they did to my father.
Then THEY hand me Sollozzo.
And when they shot me father...
We put out a lot of material through our contacts in the Newspapers...about McCluskey's being tied up with Sollozzo in the Drug Rackets...things are starting to loosen up.
You start operating, the five families will start their raids again.  We're at a stalemate Sonny, your war is costing us a lot of money.
If I accept that letter and you told a Court of Law I accepted it, they would interpret it as my having knowledge of his whereabouts. Just wait Kay, he'll contact you.
Sonny will come after you with everything he's got.
Thanks Tom.
No.  I guess I'll see you Christmas. Everyone's going to be out at Long Beach, right?
As long as I tell him beforehand he won't object.  He'll be hurt, but he won't object.
For dinner.  Unless I call and tell them we're still in New Hampshire.
I'm thinking about it.
How is your father?
Huh?
Please say it.
Oh your father just had too many visitors.  It interfered with the hospital service.  The police came and made them all leave just ten minutes ago.  But don't worry.  I look in on him.
How's Mom?
On the three days Paulie was sick this month, he got calls from a payphone across from the old man's building.  We got people in the phone company.  Thank God it was Paulie...we'll need Clemenza bad.
Until the old man tells me different.
All right, get him in a different room; lock the door from the inside. I'll have some men there inside of fifteen minutes.  Sit tight, and don't panic.
Cut it out.
Is it all right if I go to the bathroom?
Be patient.
Is my credit good enough to buy you out?
The hotel, the casino.  The Corleone family wants to buy you out.
You're unlucky.
Is that good?
Oh darling -- is that for me?
Oh, it was.
It's Tom. Tom Ripley. We were at Princeton together.
Well, I knew you, so I suppose you must have known me.
Can you mix a martini?
What? What's this?
I don't know, Dickie, I'm just telling you what I --
Sure. I love Venice.
No! I've got more than one shirt!
Okay, you get in. I'm like a prune anyway.
I can't. I can't keep spending your father's money.
What club?
You can't blame him. You could hardly expect this to go on forever.
That's good.
Ripley's plans.
Really? To Italy?
Marge and I are getting married.
You can be a leech -- you know this -- and it's boring. You can be quite boring.
What evening?
In fact the only thing which looks like Dickie is you.
Tom Ripley. Thank you, sir.
I've always wanted to go to Europe, sir, but...
I just don't believe that!
Such as?
Mr Ripley? I'm Alvin MacCarron.
I don't care for B.S. I don't care to hear it. I don't care to speak it.
I absolutely agree with Marge.
Sure.
So I'm learning.
Yes -- I'm on a good streak, thanks.
Where's Dickie?
Search me. I guess we're abandoned.
I think you're right.
Marge, when did you get here?
I'd swear he didn't. Of course he didn't.
Get on. I'll take you to him.
Dickie hasn't killed himself. I'm sure of that. There's a private detective on the case now -- a Mr MacCarron -- Dickie's father's employing him.
Marge, I'm in the bath. Won't be long.
You were at the Opera? Well, that explains -- yes I was there. I was there with Dickie.
No, it's Tom's. Splendid, eh?
What?
How did you know that?
Is Freddie in Rome?
I've left Marge, Meredith. And Mongi. So the rat's here now, in Rome.
I know.
I thought you were enjoying yourself?
You're crazy! It's freezing out there.
You're such a pal to understand. It's as if Marge is here now -- I look at you and I see her face -- and I can't, whatever I'm feeling towards you -- I just can't...
Well, you've spotted me and so you get the reward.
Just kidding. Are you alone?
They found this in Dickie's place in Rome.
I am. I really am. And I've been travelling. I just can't seem to get that far north.
Thanks.
Ten thirty?
But the point is Dickie -- well we know this -- Dickie loves Marge and he misses her and apparently he's come to his senses...
What do you mean? They're sending someone from Rome?
I'll fix some drinks.
I'm fine.
You try. You try talking to her.
I give up.
I don't know. Both. My plan right now is to go up on deck, look at the sunset. Come with me.
Good. But I think we should stay in here for the rest of the trip.
Was who Meredith?
You're such a liar...
Yes, if it's going to help, certainly.
Postmortem?
31 people.
You have, yes.
The .32's $150 -- and you're really getting a good deal now -- and all together it comes to, ah, seven eighty- five for four pieces and a holster. Hell, I'll give you the holster, we'll make it seventy-five and you've got a deal -- a good one.
Oh, you see lots of freaky stuff in a cab. Especially when the moon's out.
No. It was you. You had some manila folders and a pink bag from Saks.
If it wasn't for a drunk I would have picked you up. He wanted to go to the DMZ.
South Bronx. The worst. I tried to ditch him, but he was already in the cab, so I had to take him. That's the law. Otherwise I would have picked you up.
I didn't mean you. But just ordinary people. A guy I know -- Dough-Boy -- met his wife that way. They got to talking. She said she usually caught the bus so he started picking her up at the bus stop, taking her home with the flag up.
I work a single, which means there's no replacement -- no second man on the cab. Six to six, sometimes eight. Seventy-two hours a week.
Sometimes 76 or 80. Sometimes I squeeze a few more hours in the morning. Eighty miles a day, a hundred miles a night.
It keeps ya busy.
I'm no pusher, Betsy. Honest. I never have pushed.
I'm leaving.
My God!
I'm getting a taxi.
Keep it.
Yes. It won't be long now. Seventeen days.
Oh, I got over that. It was nothing, really. The papers always blow these things up.  A little stiffness. That'll go away. I just sleep more, that's all.
Thank you, Travis.
Yeah.
You forgot "sexy".
Just didn't get around to it, huh?
Kidding around... you know, fun.
I'm great. Always set my fingers on fire. If you want to see another trick. I do this thing with my nose.
Awh, come off it, Pal.
We don't have ju-jukes. We don't have Coca-Cola. We only got Royal Crown Cola.
No.
You said that?
We call him Dough-Boy cause he likes the dollars. He'll chase a buck straight into Jersey.
Fuckin' Mau Mau land, that's what it is.
What ya gonna do with all that money, Dough-Boy?
In the jungle. 122nd.
I mean, you handle some pretty rough traffic, huh?
Yeah. Hey thanks. That's real nice, Travis.
I don't want to make it. I came here to get you out.
Why should I want to get out of here? This is where I live.
Oh, come off it, man.
Don't you want to make it?  Can't you make it?
You can do it in my mouth.
I understand, mister. It means something, really.
He looks like a killer.
I never been to a commune. I don't know. I saw pictures in a magazine, and it didn't look very clean to me.
Do I look like a narc?
Cops don't do nothin.
Well, Iris, I look at it this way. A lot of girls come into my cab, some of them very beautiful. And I figure all day long men have been after them: trying to touch them, talk to them, ask them out. And they hate it. So I figure the best I can do for them is not bother them at all. So I don't say a thing. I pretend I'm not even there. I figure they'll understand that and appreciate me for it.
I can't. Otherwise, I would.
I'll give you the money to go. I don't want you to take any from those guys.
Listen -- I mean I just saw the needle of the Empire State Building. You can't see it for the fog!
Well, you should know, damn it, or who else would know? Pull over right here.  Why don't you stick your goddamn head out of the goddamn window once in a while and find out about the goddamn fog!
I can't sleep nights.
I know. I tried that.
Physical? Criminal?
Education?
Military record?
What kind of guns do you guys use? .38's?
You would, huh?
My name is Henry Krinkle -- that's with a "K." K-R-I-N-K-L-E. I live at 13 1/2 Hopper Avenue, Fair Lawn, New Jersey. Zip code 07410.  Got that?
Great, hey. Thanks a lot.
O.K., cowboy.
Hey, mister, I don't know what's going on here. This don't make any sense.
Some fleet driver for Bell just got cut up. Just heard it on the radio.
Shoot. They don't call me the Wizard for nothing.
I know.
That's just about the dumbest thing I ever heard, Wizard.
Yeah. Sorry, Wizard.
You know how I feel about what you do.
Archbishop of Canterbury.  Imprisoned and executed by Henry the Second ...
You're not wimping out on us, Goodspeed.
Where is he sir?  RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME.  What's he doing?  HE'S ON THE= PHONE.  I DON'T FUCKING KNOW, HIS STOCKBROKER! Oh shit.  Gotta go.
For cottonmouth. Goodspeed and the S.E.A.L.s exchange looks.
Yes.  To wish someone a prosperous jouey.
Oh, yes.  Yes, he was.
And  I love you, Pete!
Well... where can we go?
You must not remember anything. Come on.
Actually, I was married.  For four years.  But... well, we didn't fit together.  I'm divorced now.
Nope.  Just filling in the blanks.
Thanks.
Delly.  I'm... I'm not... Harry wasn't my father.  And I'm not... I'm not Luke.
Mr. Appleton, do you know an "Albert Lucas Trumbo?"
Referring to line thirty-seven of the document, does your printed name and signature appear there?
We see it.  For the record, it reads "Lucille Angstrom."  What's the point of this?
That's not a contradiction at all, sir.  I went to the meeting, but I didn't go as a member.
I'll do my best, Mr. Chairman.
Ben, when's Delly due back?
Don't mention it.  Welcome home, Luke.
The Bijou?
Good to meet you.  Again.
Well, he loves the place.  It's his home.
That's... well, that's very generous, but if you've already got a store...?
Harry, son.  Harry.
When did I leave?
Oh, I had Irene and Old Tim but they really couldn't help much. Broke their hearts when we closed up.  Broke mine, too.  But now that you're back, well, things will be different around here, that's for sure.  C'mon, I'll show you where we live.
"one fryer and two-dozen eggs?"
Oh, hi Cue... Carl.  Sorry.
Goodnight, son.  'Night, Delly.
They're...
Oh, no, I...
The film broke...
Did you fix the damn film?  It broke in the last reel.
Vultures...
You're not going anywhere, Harry.
Sure, I suppose.  That why you're on a bender?
Sandra Sinclair.
I... no, I... I just can't...
Call me... Ishmael?
She's very pretty.
Don't smell nothin'.  He must not be dead in here.
What's his rent?
Huh?  Oh, sure.  Just pull the door shut when you leave.
"Ashes To Ashes?"
So it doesn't make any difference that I'm not one now, and have never been one.
It's wrong, Leo.
I'm not sorry for what I said.
Luke didn't smoke.
Besides, I don't even know if I want to write anymore.
You should keep track of your old school chums.  Turns out she eventually joined the communist party.  On top of which, she's Lucy Angstrom Hirschfeld now, and she happens to be a writer for "Studio One" on CBS.
So, our lawyers had a talk with the Committee's lawyers.  That Elvin Clyde fella won't be too happy about it, but we cut a deal. They cleared you -- and they're gonna thank you publicly for your testimony purging yourself.
No, I...
Sure.  Come on in.  I was just packing.
Oh...
I wasn't alone.  Wasn't Frankie Ruskin directing the picture you're in?
I'll have to think about this.  I have to get back... I should go...
You look familiar, fella.  What's your name?
The man at the post office sent me. He said you'd know the name of the little Brenner girl.
No, not really.
It's a lovely garden.
No. Just a few hours.
Well... something like that.  I'm sorry. I don't mean to sound so mysterious.
Yes.
Yes, I did.
Well, I'd really hope to rent it for...
Sure. You can have it.  Where's your bag? In the car?
No, it's not the cut that's bothering me.
I think so.
Where are you from originally, Annie?
Annie -- there's nothing between Mitch and me.
What do you mean?
When was this?
Different?
When I got back to San Francisco I spent days trying to figure out just what I'd done to displease her.
Because she was afraid.
That's up to you.
Cathy!
No!
Well, I suppose...
I know.
Darling, of course I do!
I don't know yet.
Take it into the living room, would you, hon?
Did you put the cover on that cage, Mom?
Morning.
Try my best.
Yes?
Down at the dock by the Tides Restaurant. Ever handled an outboard boat?
Okay.
They're back!
A delivery, Mother. Miss Daniels brought some birds from San Francisco.
I'm simply quoting the law.
Yes.
Mother, where did you go to law school?
Yes, Mother.
I don't know when.  We'll see what...
I don't mind, really.
All right, I'll grant you a bird'll panic in an enclosed room. But, they didn't just get in. They came in! Right down that chimney.
What I'm trying to say, Mitch, is these things happen sometimes, you know? Ain't much we can do about it. 
Now hold it, Mitch. You don't know that for a fact.
Up on the coast. About sixty miles north of here.
What?
These are for my sister... her birthday you see. As she'll be eleven and... well, frankly, I wouldn't want a pair of birds that were too demonstrative.
As the same time, I wouldn't want birds that were aloof, either.
I suppose not. Is there an ornithological reason for keeping them in separate cages?
How can you tell?
A little birdie told me.  Good day, Miss Daniels.  Madam. 
That's true. I'll rephrase it. I saw you in court.
Do you remember one of your practical jokes that resulted in the smashing of a plate glass window?
I'll find something else.  See you in court some day.
That's right. What are you doing in Bodega Bay?
It's still bleeding a little. Here, let me put this on.
I loathe you. You have no manners. And you're arrogant and conceited and... I wrote you a letter about it, in fact, but I tore it up.
Of course, how stupid of me. A quarter to seven, will that be all right?
You're sure now? You won't hire a boat or anything?
Oh, yes.
No.
Yes, I was lying.
I'm trying to get you to stay for dinner. We're going to have a lot of roast left over.
Helping travelers.
A gull smashed into Annie's front door.  Mitch... what's happening?
Well, they'll go along with anything.
Take wing!
Mmm?
With my little sparrow leading team.
I'm frightened, Mitch.
Inland.
I don't want to be safe. I want to be with you.
And he'll talk?
I have no idea.
Birds are not aggressive creatures, Miss. They bring beauty to the world. It is mankind, rather, who...
To...  To kill them.
Yeah, birds. All they do is make a mess of everything. Who needs them?
Not if they're starting a war.
Then let's go. Now!
All right, all right!  Hope you figure this out, folks.
Of course -- it's the soul of the business -- the pay --
Ask this one favor --
Richardson is a fine student.  He's got a glib tongue, but you'll be a better doctor, Fettes.  Come along now --
Who would believe that?  And you know, someone else might recognize her.  She was as well known as the Castle Rock.
I can't.
I am not at the school anymore. I left last night.
I suppose we can't prevent that, Gray --  -- for auld lang syne.
Oh, it's the bit of a girl Fettes was talking about.
In the brain, I tell you. I know.
Would you grudge me a glass with my old crony, Meg?
I've ordered nothing from you.
We have never been friends.
Would you bribe me to leave you be?
Only Brother.
A carriage overturned.  My husband was killed and Georgina was hurt.
Three years.
There's nothing I can say for one small child?
But she must be able to move. Everything is in place.
Aye --
No great lady will ever take my place?
He must leave me alone.
Where are they?
You're wrong.
Tell her... we'll get him.
Someday he'll surface and I'll get him for both of you. I promise. I'll find the guy with the scar.
"Down?" Wait, don't tell me.
Yeah. I sure will.
Keep that thing away from me.
You said you saw me with this. I never held it until today.
There's no scar. Corvis made it up.
A job. Construction. Twelve an hour.
What happened to your leg there Officer? Hunting accident?
Someone else did it.
And another one. There. Erlich. Took a wrong turn.
It's what Lauren would do.
Erin. I'll always be with you.
Good for you. You do know something.
Could say that.
Let's hope not. License and registration please.
Not tonight. Honest.
Just hold on to me.
Honey. I just can't.
Erin. I know you think she's been talking to you.
Watch out!
Looks like you have them both on.
He'll be there at 8:30.
Almost negligible... With variation of parameters, this is the answer.
It isn't faith that makes good science, Mr. Klaatu. Its curiosity.  Sit down, please. I have several thousand questions to ask you.
That was my first question.
Yes -- that is true.
Would you care to be more specific?
That's what I came to see you about.
My name is Carpenter and I'm a very earthy character living in a respectable boarding house.
I assure you such power exists.
Why don't you leave it to me? I'll think of something.
I think we've all been hearing too much about "space men."
That's enough, Bobby. I think it's time you went to bed.
Professor Barnhardt.
I followed Mr. Carpenter -- right after you left -- and, gee, Mom, where do you think he went? Right into the space ship!
Honest, Mom, I saw him. It just opened up and he walked right in. And that great big iron man was moving around!
No, I haven't, Mom. I promise you... I saw it!
No -- I'm afraid not.
I shouldn't be at all surprised.
Gee! How could they make a landing?
I don't know, Bobby. I'm inclined to doubt it.
Sure. Didn't you ever hear of Arlington Cemetery?
We'll finish it tomorrow... Goodnight, Bobby.
He told me this morning when I examined him. He's seventy-eight.
Sit down, Mr. Harley.
About five months -- your months.
About 250 million of your miles.
I'm afraid, in the present situation you'll have to learn to think that way.
This is not a personal matter, Mr. Harley. It concerns all the people on your planet.
We've been monitoring your radio broadcasts for a good many years. That's how we learned your languages. Lately, we've been getting your television also.
Apparently I'm not as cynical about Earth's people as you are.
I can judge only by what I see.
You ready?
I hope Mr. Carpenter won't think I'm intruding.
I've got a good lock on my door.  And Bobby's going to sleep in my room tonight.
All right, Tom -- it's true. I know it's true.
That's what I'm trying to tell you. We mustn't do anything about it. Believe me, Tom, I know what I'm talking about.
I'm not going to marry anybody.
Jittery is the word.
Naturally I think so.
Yes--?
You mean he has the power of life and death?
He'll have you -- and Tom.
You might keep this.  I think the professor will want to get in touch with me.
I'd give you a very good price.
It's really quite simple... The three- body problem, you know.
You don't.
This one could save your life.
El Vampiro.
I've only got one question for you, and I want an honest answer.  Have you taken any human victims yet?
They're gonna book us.
The meanest!
Honda 250, huh?
What's goin' on, Marko?
If you ever want to see Star again, then you better come with us.
Where the hell are you from, Kryton???
Okay, okay.
Sam, don't --
Whatcha doin' over here?
Been fixin' to build me fence one of these days.  Bought all the materials, then put it off... for about ten years.  Well, one more day won't hurt. Wanna go into town with me?
This is Michael.
I like Michael.
He's just a deep sleeper.
Oh, no, you won't.
I get off in another twenty minutes.  I thought maybe we'd all get a bite together.
Then let's act like friends. Let's talk.  I know this is a new place, and --
Soon.
Soon as I finish this comic.  Okay?
We can't talk about it on the phone.
He's already gone to bed.
Ah... I didn't know you were having guests...
C'mere, Nanook.
Mom!
Ohm I would have been... one marriage ago.
I hear this is the decade for cute.
You're thinking of the groom not seeing the bride before the wedding.
I thought you said they needed discipline?
It's you I was after all along, Lucy.  To be our day time guardian. I knew if we could bring Sam and Michael into the faimly, there'd be no way you could say no.
Me, too.
Sort of.  We used to come here summers when I was kid.  Now we're here on a permanent basis.
Don't be a baby.  That didn't hurt and you know it.
Okay.
It's not too late for you to be saved... but each night... it becomes harder and harder for me to resist killing...
Save Laddie first.
That's okay, Mom.  I can see it later.  I'll help you unload.
Mom, just give me five more minutes. Just five minutes, okay?
Come on, Sam, you know before there were malls there was 'like the ocean.'
Don't turn on the light.
Nanook...
Nothing!  I didn't hurt him.  <u>He</u> bit <u>me</u>!  This is <u>my</u> blood!
Look at your reflection in the mirror!!
Huh?...
I... I don't feel any differently.  Do you?
It was a life form that was able to imitate and reproduce, whatever it ate or absorbed, cell for cell.
Nothing.  Nothing at all.
If the weather clears enough before we reach anybody -- I'm sending you and Doc up to MacMurdo...
Watch Clark.
Watch him close.  Ask him why he didn't kennel the dog.
We'll see...
Ain't it there?
Cut, bullshit.  Been pulled apart.
No.  Just let him freeze out there.
Who you trying to protect, mutherfucker?  I'm telling you this S.O.B. could be one of them.
Look, I'm just guessing...
That's good enough.
But...
What clothes?
We'll see.  Let's try Clark.
If you're worried about anything, let's take that blood test of yours.
I'm a real light sleeper, Childs...
How far's that?
Started with six.  There'd be four others left.
Well, stick to it.
Well, stick with it.  I want you at it round the clock.  We got to get help in here...
What are you talking?!  He's had two months training in those choppers!
Move it, Palmer.
Anyplace but here.
Forget about Childs.  He's over.
The generator!
What kind of stories?
What happened?
No...
I was lucky.  The others weren't.
Why should I help you?  You primates -- you great, lumbering, hairy animals, drenched in blood from the moment of your hideous conception -- what have you ever used knowledge for but destruction and bloodshed!  A little bit of learning and you lay waste to the world!  You're no better than the Morlocks!
It was meant to.
Yes.  But you've done enough. Thank you for your help... I hope someday people read your books again.
This way.
The Morlocks didn't build this.
I won't leave you like this.
I will...
And who are you, Alexander?  Who are you to question thousands of years of evolution?  This is the world now.  I am fact.
When a creature shows too much independent thought we remove them from the gene pool.  We're breeding them for submission.  Soon they will be fully domesticated.
No...
I'm a foolish man.
I know.
Oh, you won't be running for long...
I don't think that's going to happen.
Thanks.  Old Nell's my girl all right.  Al least when she decides to move, stubborn beast.
Ahhh... I'm afraid I've got a prior commitment.
What's happening to the moon?!
Why is it -- breaking up?
And what do you propose, Professor? Shall we hold a seminar to study the problem?
You know I can't.
Not here... alone.  Please.
Perseverance.
I came by the house every day after the funeral.  And then every week. Then every other month.  Then I stopped coming.  Did you even notice?
It hurt me, Alex.  Very much.
For God's Sake, David --
What is it?
There are trains leaving Grand Central every then minutes.  A dozen liners leaving the harbor. Get on one of them.  Go to Singapore, Scotland, Manchuria, anywhere, just away from here --
Good night, Alex.
His home.
Thank you.
You're not from beyond the valley.
Thank you...
Good night.
We share everything.
Yes.
What's it all for?
Most things.  We're very high on purpose.
Or mud carriers.
What are you?
You know this?
You lost someone.
Someone you loved very much.
I have it, but don't you think for one moment I'll be letting you go out in that filthy coat -- now go upstairs and change.  I've laid out your green coat.
Then if Emma turns me down will you marry me?
May I get you some --
Do they?
I took a different route.
They've gone to a better place.
We choose to believe it.
Kalen...
That's quite enough, Kalen.
Depends on what you're seeing.
My business?
Getting away with things. Like whatever I may or may not have gotten away with Officer Harrison.
You in here. [Beat] Works like a drug.
Oh yeah, sure. He killed a cop, right?
Oh yeah, what'd he say?
That's too bad.
I wish they'd skip the formality of this annual review and just cut our budget. Our silence on the matter should be enough to appease the civic conscience without wasting an hour we don't have.
I am. One of the few things I remember doing is eating. So I guess I must be exercising it off in my dreams.
Sure.
No, it hasn't.
Mom, this is the guy that drove us home that afternoon we were stuck on the highway. The guy you yelled at for no good reason...
Jackie.
I don't know. [Beat] I thought I was crazy after you left that day. I died. I still think I could be crazy. But then I replayed that night in my head -- the parts of it I could remember -- and it was like...I don't care if I was, or am. I haven't felt that way in a room with someone my whole life. [Beat] And when you left, all I wanted was...
You've got to get yourself out of that place. They're going to kill you if you don't.
It's not a prison, it's a hospital. There's got to be some way out of there and you've got to find it...
Here, drink this. I'll get the heat going.
[Beat] I don't know.
It's Sunday.
Why are you saying that? [Beat] We don't have long, do we?
Ok.
You're bleeding pretty bad there.
I fell down. [Beat] But I'm alive.
I see you've done your homework. [Beat] Alpine Grove's undergone a lot of changes since then. At the time, we didn't have the...resources to help our patients the way we needed to. [Beat] Now, we do. And things are different.
I could try to...make it stop.
How do you know about Dr. Becker?
Why would we do that?
[Beat] Yeah, it is.
Come on. Tell me what you do know.
No. Not for people like me. [Beat] Not in the places I come from.
I didn't see that much of it -- same as now. I only saw it as part of my own life.
You told me about him. I saw you and I think you thought I knew something about him. So you told me.
I did?
You still don't believe me, do you?
No. Listen to me...the kid, Eugene...
Sure. It's an easy address. A little far out there, but easy enough.
Why?
Sure.
[Beat] I'm not deaf.
I'm not sure. [Beat] I don't really know.
Well, you definitely didn't pick normal or simple this time either.
I'll manage.
You know what? It's Christmas Eve. And you look clean -- I mean, you're normal-looking. [Resolutely, for her own benefit] It's Christmas Eve, and I have a couch.
Maybe. [Beat] Maybe not.
May be easy to remember, but not easy to get. Being warm, maybe -- but, look, you don't even have a coat and I still have to chop wood to make a fire. [Beat] And, being happy...you tell me if that's simple.
What.
I don't know, honey.  I guess it would depend.
Hal, I've told you about twenty times, yes, I could identify 'em, but neither one of them was the type to pull something like this.
It's a nightclub, not a drive-in, Hal.  I don't follow the customers to the parking lot.
Tell us about him.
My Lord.
He's got nothin' to gain by lyin'.  Nothin' at all.  He already got all their money.  I just don't know what we're dealin' with here. Anyway, it went out again last night on Nationwide Teletype.  Let's just wait it out a little longer.  She said she was gonna call back.  Let's just sit tight.
You do?  Is he a funny uncle? 'Cause if he is, then he and I got somethin' in common.
What for?
Yeah, you're startin' to feel pretty good to me, too.
Human nature.  I'm majoring in behavioral science.
Darryl, that's my husband, he says he's not ready.  He's still too much of a kid himself.  He prides himself on being infantile.
She's off with Jimmy, that's her boyfriend.
Nope.  I've never robbed a bank.
Well, I robbed a gas station once, and I robbed a couple of liquor stores, and some convenience stores. And that's it.
And smooth, boy, you are smooth.
Ask me no questions, I'll tell you no lies.
Are you in town?  This sounds long distance.
I know.  Call me back.  Louise, I love you, okay?
I got it.  I was afraid I'd missed you.  I almost couldn't get a check cashed.  It's Saturday.
Who is it?
Jimmy, my daddy's still alive and it kind of gives me the creeps when you do that...
Maybe.
Oh yeah.
Yes.
In the back?
You mean you haven't asked him yet? For Christ sake, Thelma, is he your husband or your father?  It's just two days.  For God's sake, Thelma. Don't be a child.  Just tell him you're goin' with me, for cryin' out loud.  Tell him I'm havin' a nervous breakdown.
What time are you gonna pick me up?
Okay.  I will, too.
Aw, shit, Thelma, he's gonna kill you.
Tell me somethin'.  Is this my vacation or isn't it?  I mean, God, you're as bad as Darryl.
Yeah!
Get the car.
Tell them what?!  What, Thelma? What do you think we should tell them?
Just what is that supposed to mean?
Why are you actin' like this?
I suggested we go to the police, but you didn't like that; so, frankly, Louise, I'm all out of ideas.
Give me the keys.
It's probably not a good idea.
I'm sorry.  I'm just not in the mood for company right now.  Here.  Take this map.  I need you to find all the secondary roads to Mexico from Oklahoma City.  I think we should stay off the interstates.  We're too conspicuous.
You know, Louise, you're supposed to be my best friend.  You could at least be a little bit happy for me. You could at least pretend to be slightly happy that for once in my life I have a sexual experience that isn't completely disgusting.
What for?
Let's get it over with.
What.
Yeah.  Those.  That always put the fear of God in me.  What about you?
Well, now, maybe you won't have to.
Just ignore him.
I swear, before yesterday, neither one of us would have ever pulled a stunt like this.  But if you ever met my husband, you'd know why I just can... You wanna step out of the car, please?  You wanna put your hands on your head, please?  Louise, shoot the radio.
Yes.
That guy was hurtin' me.  And if you hadn't come out when you did, he'd a hurt me a lot worse.  And probably nothin' woulda happened to him. 'Cause everybody did see me dancin' with him all night.  And they woulda made out like I asked for it.  And my life woulda been ruined a whole lot worse than it is now.  At least now I'm havin' fun.  And I'm not sorry the son of a bitch is dead. I'm only sorry that it was you that did it and not me.  And if I haven't, I wanna take this time to thank you, Louise.  Thank you for savin' my ass.
What do you mean?
Gosh, didn't he say anything positive at all?
Well, let me know when you figure it out.
Good.
We can change our names.
Yup.
Yeah, right.  We're not gonna get caught.
What?!
I know this whole thing was my fault.  I know it is.
You too, sweetie, the best.
Unbearable, I'd imagine.
Go?
You got that right.
So you admit it?
Good-looking?
Never?
Look, I admit it was brief, but it was definitely love. Crushes don't last twelve years.
Relax, this guy owes me a big one. A couple years ago he got in a jam up in the Boston office; some bullshit about padding his resume -- like we haven't all done that. Anyway, they were going to let him go but his mother wrote a tear-jerker letter that ended up on my desk.
He'll do better than that. I'll send him down to Miami on business, you throw him a couple bucks on the side, and he'll track her down.
What?
Huh? But why did Healy?
Are you crazy? I've unleashed a psycho on her. She's gonna be fucking pissed.  She's even more beautiful than I remember.
Pipes? What are you talking about?
No.
Jesus Christ you're right.
Who?
Who?
Big time.
You found my car?!
Yep.
Dumbshit.
Nepal? Have you been?
Wow. That's a place I've always wanted to go. Is it true the mountains are so tall you can't see the tops?
Thanks.
I already know it, Mary.
I beg your pardon?
They keep him confined? That's bullshit!
We will, but first I have a surprise.
Why bounce when you have your own condo in Nepal to go to?
Well, I'll see ya.
What?
Come on, what were you going to say?
Hey, watch your mouth -- she's a great gal. I'm the dumbshit for lying to her.
We're gonna go out tonight. Oh, that reminds me, I've got to call what's- his-face and cancel.
I don't know, maybe you could poke around for a half day and see if she has five kids and a Labrador.
You can't be serious.
Oh my.
She's in a wheelchair?!
Ted? Don't you want the name of the housing project?
Yeah, I don't know why but I always felt at home in the fronton.
Good good.
It's a goddamn bunion. It'll heal.
Fetched a pretty penny, too. Don't forget, it's the Sumo culture, they pay by the pound there. Sort of like tuna.
What do you mean 'why'?
What?! You're calling me a stalker?
I don't know what you're talking about.
What?
Did you build the Estadio Olympico?
But... but you knew people at Harvard.
Hey, hey, hey, I'm not the one who started telling bald-faced lies about the competition -- that's crossing the line!
You were following us?
No prob, I could use the company. I've been on the road going on fifteen hours straight.
Nah. I'm... I'm nothing.
Think about it. You walk into a video store and you see Eight-Minute Abs and right next to it you see Seven- Minute Abs -- which one you gonna spring for?
Bingo. Especially since we guarantee you'll get every bit as good a work- out.
I'm sick of these calorie-countin' pansies. Give me a guy who likes kielbasa and beer and playing thirty- six holes and still has enough energy to take me and Warren out to a ballgame.
All right for awhile? The guy's good- looking, rich, witty. He was a god.
Bet your ass I have. It's an important job, Neighborhood Watch is.
These ain't strangers, they're neighbors. This only picks up signals in a half-mile radius.
Oh, yeah, of course, dear.
Healy.
No no, the bigger the better.  But I must say, they could be a little brighter. Nothing's sexier than a mouthful of pearly whites.
I appreciate you looking out for me.
Well... I've got a little more news about your friend Healy.
Tucker, I appreciate you doing all this, but I'm really strapped for time here and --
No, a couple of the players and me were joking around and, uh, I fell off the school.
Oh yeah.
Yup, that's right. Junior prom... kinda.
Mary, we haven't seen each other in twelve years.  Don't make me wait another day.
Hi, Ted.
Hm?
I mean he murdered someone and did time back in Boston. The guy's a freak.
Well, lucky for me I found out. Thank God I have friends like Tucker.  Look, I'm sick of talking about stalkers.  Let's talk about you.
What are you?
Bullshit, a twenty-two doesn't carry a one-iron -- don't sandbag me, lady.
We'll see. If it doesn't, what the hell, at least I gave it a shot.
Wow. That's too bad. He sounds almost perfect.
Uh no. I think I'm gonna get out while I'm ahead.
All right, let's go.
Yeah, sure.
Wait, hold on, Mary -- it's not as bad as it sounds. I certainly didn't know --
Mary, come on...
Okay.
You forgot your keys!
I was playing a trick. I-I-I had a baseball.
Shhhhhh!
Teddy, be brave.
No, no, no, I'll be fine. I'll just hang my shirttail out and work on it in the morning.
Great. Great.  So listen, uh, I was wondering if maybe you wanted to go to the prom you know, with me.
We keep 'em in the dark as long as we can. But I sure as hell am going to test him.
We've got bigger problems right now.
He's right. And things are happening too fast. It smells like the Bay of Pigs all over again.
Rescind the order. Can all the Chiefs. Put Nitze, Gilpatric and the Undersecretaries in charge.
-- I'm just trying to make a point. This idea is that fucking bad.
What does the letter say?
Because we knew we could do a better job than everyone else.
Then they should speak up.
So I understand you correctly. If the missiles in Cuba were dismantled, returned to the Soviet Union, and a guarantee was made not to reintroduce them, the United States would be prepared to guarantee that it would never invade Cuba?
And, of course, the U.N. must be allowed to observe the redeployment of forces from the American Southeast.
Busy. But you've got his heart.
I said his heart, not his attention.
He was.
Why don't you ask him yourself? You can have him on the way home.
Well, you know how Bobby has it in for the State of Mississippi.
Today, for your information, is Pulaski Day. We're going to Buffalo...
There've got to be alternatives to just going out and bombing them.
No way.
They want this fucking job, they can have it. It's no great joy to me.
Why else would they approach us in this way? It's deniable. The Soviets have done nothing but lie to us. This could be more of the same.
Jesus Christ...
We've worked up several military scenarios. Before I ask General Taylor to lead us through the various options, I'd like for us to adopt a rule. If we are going to strike, we must agree now that we will do it before the missiles become operational. Because once they are, I don't think we can guarantee getting them all before at least some are launched.
Mr. President! We're receiving reports that the ships are stopping!
Are you hungry? I have some nice raw kidney in the truck.
James Looks Twice?
Your good friend Leo Fast Elk.
I think maybe you guys got off the wrong exit, yeah? This is the Bear Creek Indian Reservation.
Goodbye.
His mother needs a piece of his hair. It's for the Keeping of the Souls Ceremony.  Has to be kept for four days.
Ray.
Check him out, Ray.
Who the fuck is he?
Ray Levoi, Sir. Pleasure.
Get the plate numbers off everyone of these cars.
One of the leaders of the Warriors of All Red Nations. Militant organization.
Jimmy Looks Twice put Leo's head through a glass door of the tribal offices three months ago. And threatened him several times since. President Clear Moon and the regional FBI feel he made good on that threat.
She talks a lot of shit. We're not doing our job. Jimmy's innocent. "What's the FBI really doing here." Some shit about the Fort Laramie Treaty.
Let's see it.
Cooch. What's the Fort Laramie Treaty?
A long way from home. You be careful out there.
Whoever dusted Leo, dusted him from the driver's seat of a moving car then drove those eight miles to the Badlands. Jimmy Looks Twice has never been behind the wheel of a car. It's a known fact out here that he's petrified of driving. His parents were killed in a car wreck.
No way, Cooch.
Bullshit.
Maybe you're not aware of this, Crow Horse, but I just flew in from a place called the Twentieth Century where we have such things as electrostatic tracking methods, psycholingusitics, DNA fingerprinting; I don't have to crawl around with the scorpions and talk to the fucking trees to get answers. Leo was killed right here.
Thank God. Now listen to me, asshole. I'm giving you a break. But if my partner finds out you're here, you're gonna be reading rat tracks in Sioux Falls Maximum Security.
He wants to know if you ever watch the Cookie Monster. He says the Cookie Monster is not to be trusted -- a trickster.
He knows me?
Why should I tell you.
He also said "listen to the water."
I see. Forgive my cultural ignorance.
A what?
Ray --
You ain't no Indian. You're a Sal Mineo Indian.
They found prints at Blue Legs' place.
Crow Horse, listen --
Crow Horse, listen. You have to come with me.
What do you mean?
So they took care of Leo.
I know. Come on. We gotta get off the reservation or we're dead.
He hasn't left this place in twenty years. They got him.
You bought her some time, Kola. Ain't never gonna be over... but you bought her some time.
-- You desecrated it, it had to be burned.
Okay, Ray. I'm coming in. If he starts to leave the area, move in. And hold him. Over.
Woh, excuse me, Sir... I see what you're saying... I've got a little Indian blood, that's true. But --  I am not an... an Indian. I can't just go in and --
Yes, Washington sent me, Richard. They sent me here because this whole thing has been fucked. Do you know what I mean when I say this whole thing has been fucked, Richard?
Miles. Three other suits. That's all I know 'em as -- suits. Were you there?
It's not that.
Well, it is. It is that, too.
Yeow!
What if Captain Dawson had come with me?
How did you know this was my car?
It's classified.
I was inverted.
No.
And far too aggressive.
Evan... or Maverick.
Don't worry, I'm a new strain. And I don't give up. Everything I've ever wanted I've had to work like hell for. Well, how about it?
I don't enjoy watching things suffer.
What do you take me for? It's a Navy Cross.
What?
He was a friend of mine. A good guy...great guy. It was my fault.
What?
That's what I want.
I sit. I think. I play games.
It's strip reality, actually, like what the pilots always want to play.
Take something off.
Your watch.
Big talk for someone who's never been shot off her computer.
Oh...I'll think of something... What are you doing here?
Right on the flight line?
Sir. You are going to give me a warning, Sir!
NO JOKE, COUGAR. ON THE LEVEL. EVEN I WOULDN'T DO THAT TO YOU.
He better be kidding!
These guys are getting on my nerves.
You.
What?  What is it?
DIDN'T ... AHHH...LOOK GOOD.
NO. NO GOOD.
Passing 8. Passing 6. Lock your harness!
What are you talking about, we gotta go!
The plane is fine.
But I have to!
Any more MiGs?
You gotta have a call sign that's just your own...never changes...you have to recognize it immediately. Then, if someone shouts "Wolf, break left!"..you react right away.
Like what?
We won! Ice turns back, stares them down, then turns back into his locker, dismissing them.
So I heard. Steers it pretty close. Sorry to hear about Cougar. He was a good man.
Nothing...That's McGown...that's Singer, isn't it? GOOSE Turn around, pay attention. What are you doing?
He should've had me. GOOSE Take it down. Let's bug out of here. Call for a draw.
Come on, relax...
Bogey at three o'clock high! Nose on!
I guess that's what I'm doing, then.
Go ahead. I can't reach. 2000 feet!
No shit! That why they call him Ice?
Thirty seconds. That's all it took to blow us out of the sky.
That's because you don't have any women.
SHIT!!
You don't owe me anything. We're on the same team.
No. You can be mine!
Nope.
I think I can work it out on my own.
Just below ten thousand.
NOT ONLY THAT, BUT ZORRO GOT YOUR WINGMAN. NICE GOING.
Speaking of feet, fuel's down to 4.0.  We're gonna get them wet unless we find a Sonoco station.
Bad?
Sir?
Ahhh... Runs in the family, sir.
No bother.
Or....
It's not true.
I didn't say that. That's up to you. I think that if you do, if you choose to come back, you'll be a better pilot... a better man.
Over there man.
What was that?  An accident?
The Last Resort!  Quick!
But maybe you can change all that.
How'd you find me?
Thank you.
Not true, he's one of my best friends...He's got a big house and a Mercedes.  And you like Melina, right?  Well, you'll get to fuck her every night.--That's right.  She's gonna be Hauser's babe.
My friend, five minutes from now, you won't give a shit about the people.  Fire it up, Doc.
Impossible.  Once the reaction starts, it'll spread to all the turbinium in the planet.  Mars will go into global meltdown.--That's why the aliens never turned it on.
Who gives a shit what you believe? In thirty seconds, you'll be dead. Then I'll blow this place up...
They've got Quaid!  They're protecting him!
Don't be an idiot.
It's not my fault.  We hit a memory cap.
Why not?
Nice to meet you.
Hetero.
Sleazy...and demure.
Any news of Quaid?
Where?
Yes, you do.  That's why we brought you here.  --  Cohaagen's big secret is buried in that black hole you call a brain.  And Kuato's  gonna dig it out.
Melina!
Rekall?
Harry!
I've got Quaid.
I've got him.  The guy in the turban.
Up!
Come on!
I don't know.
Cohaagen says it's just a few extremists.
I'm late.
Some men just tried to kill me!
No!  Spies or something.  And Harry from work...Get down!
It was implanted by the Agency.
Beats me.  I just work here.
Mars.
There's something I have to tell you...
If Cohaagen wants you dead, you might be okay.
I'm not a hooker!  That's my cover.
I'm not sure dear?  What do you think?
I just has a terrible thought...What is this is all a dream?
Ready as we'll ever be.
No problem.
That's four.  Let us know if it starts moving, Burt.
I think I scared it!
I'd go for penetration.  The 458 shooting solids -- less ammo to carry anyway.
You're never going to believe this, but the canyon road...we were on it not two hours ago...well, it's completely...
What's under the ground?  We're not getting up on the roof.  Earth shelter's the best.  Known that since I was a kid.
I don't see any eyes...must be totally subterranean...and those tentacles...
Probably couldn't move too easily on the surface.
The mountains are solid granite. We'd be safe there, and we could hike along them...all the way to Bixby if we have to.
You bet.  You gonna be staying up here?
Why?
Well, sure.
I thought you called it your pecker.  Look, don't make the mistake I made.  Twenty years of looking for a woman exactly like Miss October 1968, and where'd it get me?  Here with you.
You gotta ask <u>that</u>?
Car wash?!  That's got no future. If we're gonna take the plunge we oughta have a better plan than that.
In the past year I must've said a hundred times "We gotta get out of Perfection.  We gotta better ourselves."  You gonna stand there in broad daylight and tell me you think I'm the reason we're still here?  You want to know how close I am to going to Bixby right <u>now</u>?
Then where's the goddamn Conway Twitty coming from?
That <u>is</u> the plan...I mean, goddamn it!  What the hell are those things?  How could they bury an entire Plymouth station wagon?
Naw, don't want to winch it.  That'd tear it all up.  Want to lift it. Some kind of crane with lifting straps.
Yeah.  Where's your truck?
Me, too.
Right.
Or just knock us over.  Look, use the bomb!
She just practically asked you for a date.  What the hell is wrong?!
You are so full of shit...
If that ain't the truth.  And I count on them for a little bit of stew meat...Thank you, Fred.
I think I'm gonna be sitting up with her.
Yeah, Burt.  The way you worry, you're gonna have a heart attack before you get to survive World War III.
We have to go into Bixby in the morning.  The concrete blocks are in.
That's the sky that's going to be over our roof every night, when we're done.
I didn't do it!  What's going on?
Yeah, vibrations in the ground.
You okay?
It does.
You guys do all the odd jobs.
Like <u>what</u>?!  There's nothing left that'll make it to the mountains!
LET'S DO IT!
An hour after you picked it up!
I know about Esparza.
He was your snitch.
It most certainly is.
Complain to the Bar Commission.
Your Honor: I imagine that, no matter how careful my questioning, Mr. Ortega would, in his well-intentioned way, dig my client's hole even deeper.
I suppose I could find an inmate who'd say that Shu boasted about Chinatown just to survive in the joint -- though he didn't really do it...
I didn't take my eyes off it!
I specialize, Roger...
Hey. You plan to be a criminal defense attorney, know this going in: Everybody's guilty.
Eddie... I don't know about this...
Hey -- you believe what you want. Shu Kai Kim is innocent.
You phoned up Art Esparza's wife?
Christ... Shu is innocent.
And I call your testimony hearsay. I have no more questions for you.
I didn't put him in a wheelchair. Reynard did. He can get around without one -- it's all in my report.
Eddie, if I wanted to make love with you again, I'd do it sober.
Nothing has. But that's all changing.
Screw you too, Kitty.
Want to tell me what went down here?
Exactly what happened then?
You tell me, man.
For awhile we had this dream we were innocent. That was our bond... but then we woke up. And now I'd like to hear everything.
Good. Now we're going to take an affadavit from you, but only concerning the facts of the Chinatown shooting. We honestly don't give a shit about the Kennedy assassination.
I always t-tell the truth.  That's why I'm here.
That's right.
-- Why don't you ask Chuckie?
-- Roger --
Mr. Ortega... What is "La Compania"?
I'm a soldado in the G-Wing Regiment.
A soldado, he runs messages and materiel between the regiments...
...A soldado, he takes care of it.
No! They g-got the wrong guy! I saw it! The killer wasn't Chinese.
And you b-believe that.
NO! GOD, NO...
I want you to kill for me.
Maybe our biggest. I'll see you two doors down from your place at 11:00.
What is the world coming to when you kill a guy for baby laxative?
I am not going to Cliff's trailer.
A trailer was here. What the hell do you think?
Yep, it sure is.
Did she have someone with her?
You can tell J. Edgar that I was at a party and I got fifteen fuckin' witnesses.
Got a couple of cups of coffee at Hap's from her. That's it. By the way where do you get off questioning a lawman? I could ask you the same question.
CHET, I AM CALLING YOU FROM PORTLAND... OREGON.
NO, IT'S OREGON, PORTLAND, OREGON. IT'S REGIONAL BUREAU CHIEF COLE. OUT IN PORTLAND OREGON. I NEED YOU OUT HERE, CHET.
What?
Teresa Banks.
Someone else has it now.
I'd like to ask you a few questions about Teresa Banks
How come Jack let's you work here?
She only worked here a month. Nice girl. Never seemed to get here on time though. Ask me she had a little problem with --
What do you mean?
How do you figure?
Not Cole's Uncle but probably the sheriff's uncle in federal prison.
Gordon said you were good. The tailored dress is our code for drugs. Did you notice what was pinned to it?
That's good.
It is a piece of paper with the letter "T" imprinted on it. Take a look.
I think that's a good idea.
He's not the murderer.  But he's a bozo.
You didn't do your homework?
You graduating this year will be proof that miracles happen.
No, and yes. I don't know what I'm going to do about Bobby. I know he is seeing someone else and that's okay with me, and he thinks I'm seeing someone else and that's not okay with him.
Well, why not?
I just want a friend. Just one friend for just one minute...
No place, fast.  And you're not coming.
Gotta go, Donna. I'll call you tomorrow.
I can't help you there.
And I love you, too. But don't wear my stuff.
Who would do that?
But Bob isn't real.
Buy me a ticket to The Great Went.
James, you don't know what you are talking about. Quit trying to hold on so tight. I'm gone... long gone like a turkey through the corn.
Gobble, gobble, gobble.
Okay.  Oh god, it's Johnny Horne's birthday today.
You know it and I know it.
I do love you.  Let's get lost together.
What are you talking about? Bobby didn't kill anybody.
See what?
Boating?
Hiking?
Fish eyes?
Why wouldn't you eat a fish eye, Harry?
Ben asked him to stay late to plan for the Norwegians.
Hyggelig a mote dem. Jeg Heter Leland Palmer.
Yes.
You know, I did come home, come to think of it, on Thursday. I had a severe headache and I was driving in the neighborhood so I just darted in and out of the house.  Where were you, Laura? I didn't see you?
Who am I?
Lay off the bennies, Leo.
Come off it, Leo. I'm late for work...
The man's an ambulance chaser...
Because it struck me how neatly 'three' went into the amount. Two Hundred Ten Thousand. That would mean I keep seventy.
Gruber...
No.
I...
'They lied.' Indeed! When did they lie? And do you know what a lie is?
You've just said you signed it.
That is correct. I was engaged to render an opinion.
Just as you are, Sir...
Sir. Yes. When a thing is wrong... as in this case, I am available. I am seventy-four years old, I am not board-certified.
...almost nine minutes... causing brain damage.
Nothing further, your Honor.
You may step down.
I was her doctor.
Yes.
Why wasn't she getting oxygen...?
Yes!
My God, we tried to save her... You can't know... You can't know...
I doubt we'll have to go to trial...
What you thought!? What you thought... I'm a workingman, I'm trying to get my wife out of town, we hired you, we're paying you, I got to find out from the other side they offered two hundred...
You guys, you guys, you're all the same. The Doctors at the hospital, you... it's 'What I'm going to do for you'; but you screw up it's 'We did the best that we could. I'm dreadfully sorry...' And people like me live with your mistakes the rest of our lives.
It was good of you to meet...
From what I've seen, Mr. Galvin, you have a very good case...
...What difference would...
There's nothing they can do to me.
What qualifies you as an expert in anesthetics?
'Code Blue'...
Yes? Galvin, right?
Yes.
Why is that?
This is a complicated case, your Honor...
I wasn't disbarred, they dropped the pro...
You should have taken their offer. Especially if you were unprepared.
Thank you, your Honor, I'll continue. Dr. Thompson. Did you examine Deborah Ann Kaye last night at The Northern Chronic Care Facility?
What?
If I may be permitted to question my own witness in my own way...
No, no, you listen to me. All I wanted in this case is an even shake. You rushed me into court in five days... my star witness disappears, I can't get a continuance, and I don't give a damn. I'm going up there and I'm going to try it. Let the Jury decide. They told me Sweeney he's a hard- ass, he's a defendant's judge. I don't care. I said, the hell with it. The hell with it. I'll take my chances he'll be fair.
And are they going to get it?
Yes.
Is there going to be a later...?
It's over!
I don't have a goddamned idea.
I have to talk to you.
I understand. Thank you, my name is Galvin. I'll be at the following number in a half an hour. It's urgent.
How come you're calling me from...?
Yes. Price...
My subscription lapsed three years ago...
No. At Chelsea Childcare. Okay. Look, call me Monday, hey? I'm late for work.
...I understand...
...and I have inquiries out to doctors, experts in the field... there is, of course, a problem getting a doctor to testify that another doctor's negligent...
Yes.
...everybody. Mike says, 'Pat, you mean to tell me for a buck you get a free lunch and a beer, and then you go in the back and get laid?' 'That's correct.' Mike says, 'Pat. Have you been in this bar ?' Pat says, 'No, but my sister has...'  Everyone. Buy yourself one too.
Don't touch anything.
I'm going to help her.
Not bad...? This guy's Dr. Kildare, the jury's going to love him, Mick... And you calm down, all right? Their guy, Towler's, the author of the book,  'Methodology and Practice, Anesthesiology.'  ...and they got depositions from the nurses, everybody in the operating room, the scrub-nurse... 'All these guys are God. I saw them walk on water...'  They had an obstetrical nurse in there. We got a deposition from the obstetrical nurse?
Brindisi versus Electric Boat.
I'm getting it back. Don't worry about me, Mick. I'm fine. D'you find the obstetric nurse?
I've got to go see Gruber.  What's the best cigars you have?
D'you find the obstetric nurse?
I think we tried that. The case is over.
Read me what she said.
...one of the other nurses?
We got to talk.
You saw Kat in New York...  ...or is she in town? Is she in town...?
Wait, wait, wait, you're saying that her brain damage could have been caused by her being deprived of oxygen for two minutes...?
Should I?
We had a chance...We could have stopped them!  The mob stole the trucks and smashed everything up.  The fools!  They cut their own throats!
There was a girl with them...If I could find her....
Yes...I was fishing up in the hills.
What's he like?
I didn't know how to stop you...!
It's gone now.
Don't you live at home?
But they seem to murder everything that moves...!
Yes, with these suits.  We've used them before on atomic tests... Odd- looking, aren't they?
That's the kind of a kid brother you'd have!
You'll be all right with us....  ...for as long as anybody's got!
Right.
So is the town, I notice!
I'm here to make up a report, not to interfere with the operations you've set up.  You're still in command.  Clayton Forrester!  I haven't seen you since Oak Ridge.
That's because we want a chance to observe them.  This is the only place we've had time to surround them with sufficient force to contain them.  What happens here will be a guide to all other operations. The minute action begins and a pattern of defense develops, I'll get my report to Washington.  You've deployed your forces well.
Well-l...how do you do, Dr. Forrester!
We sell the tamales, enchiladas - hot dogs!
Welcome to California!
What?
I don't know.  A couple months.  Why?
Forget those two clowns, Heather.  Answer me, did you get another call from that guy or not?
I'll be there in three hours.
No.
It was an earthquake and it was dark.  I have no idea.
Just for a few hours.  Julie'll be with you.
Rex?  Who's Rex?
Can we go get Rex, now?  The bad man's getting awful close.
A story?
It's actually been giving me Freddy nightmares.
Wes won't show it until it's finished. That's what he told me, at least.  I asked him at the funeral.
Kids know when something's bugging a parent.  You've got no idea who this is calling?
Steady...
Absolutely.  And how many times has Letterman called the cops thinking that woman was down in his kitchen again?  It gets under your skin if you let it.
Yes?
No, you don't, ma'am, it's not necessary.
They wouldn't let me...
By storytellers, of all things.  Every so often, they imagine a story good enough to catch its essence.  Then it's held prisoner for a while.  In the story.
That's not what the dreams say he's doing.
Dramatically speaking it makes perfect sense.  You played Nancy, after all, the first to humiliate and defeat him.
But it was you that gave Nancy her strength.  So to get out he has to come through you.  And it's inevitable that he'll hit you at your most vulnerable points...
Heather, this is Sara Risher over at New Line.  How are you?
No time like the present.  The car will bring you.
Coffee'd be nice.
It's time these boys saw some real blue water.
He knows.
We were idealists.
Hey!  Weigh!  Blow the man down...
Mr. Lawford, stand by to ease the mainsheet.  Rick, get on the jib sheet.  George, John, Philip, Tim and Dick go aloft to unstop the forecourse.  George will show you what to do.  Tod, show your men the forward pinrail and stand ready on the buntlines and clewlines. Forecourse first... work upward.
Everybody down!  ON THE DOUBLE!!
Butler, what'd I ever do to you?
What do you mean?
Okay.
Congratulations.
I know.
It's not a vacation, it's private school.
Nobody says you have to be like me.
It was a bad dream...
Well, and it's pretty cool too, ya know?  Bein' here together an all...
They don't know that.  We were the only one's on deck. Look, there's nothing they can do to me right?  I'm a kid.
That's like wondering if your mom and dad do it.  Who wants to know?
I said "Sorry, wrong room" and walked away.
My dad.
Swear to God.  Only good advice he ever gave me.  Now, go back to sleep.
I can't make it out?
Yes sir.
All stop on the engine.
The fact is... We'd like you to give Phil another chance.
So is violating international law.
Twice.
No.
Why are you here?
It's okay.  I'll be in, in a minute.  Look, what do you want?
We're short one long boat too.  Come on.
Not a chance.  Remind them that according to the Geneva Convention, firing on a civilian vessel on the high sea is an act of war.
Will you shut up?  You sound like my fucking sister.
We'll think of something.
Lemme go!  Lemme go!!
Shut up donut.
Like you'd know what to do with one.
I've seen 'em.  I've seen 'em.
I figured it out.
Okay donut.  Whatever you say.
You know what he is talking about here?
What is it... the secret?
If it were only that simple, my young friend.  Read on, gentlemen. Read on.
He didn't get to be Under Secretary of the Air Force by being neighborly.
You've gotta be kidding?
Son of a bitch!!
I can't.
Yes, I was.
Except, a "White Squall".  With all due respect Captain Sheldrake, they're only boys...
Is it true that the reason you expelled Philip Boutillier...
I understand.
... Absolutely not.
Well, that's so good to hear, Artie. You know some of us depend on you down this way. You're so entertainin' and you get so many interestin' guests.
Thanks, Bobby, 'bout done.
You an indian?
What's that?
When did you talk to Lula?
Have now.
She's my girl... She's drivin'... That bother you?
That guy Sailor came around this afternoon... Asked me if there was a contract out on 'im.
Got enough, thanks. We're lookin' for a place has some music, where we can maybe do some dancin' - get somethin' to eat, too. Anything like that around here?
Thanks.
No... She's fine. Back home.
Set one up.
No sir...
Muchas gracias.
Mr. San Pedro Sula's got an appliance shop.
Mr. San Pedro Sula's permit to kill.
Woman drivin' down the street spotted me with on a roof with my rifle. She called the police and they came over and arrested me. Thought I was a sniper! Boys at the VFW loved that one. Cops didn't understand about the pigeons, the damage they do to personal property. I used to complain to the city but they never lifted a finger. I was gonna put out poison, but I was afraid somebody's cat would eat it. Hell, I had six cats myself. So I used the .22 because it didn't make much noise and the ammo was cheap.
If you are truly wild at heart, you'll fight for your dreams... Don't turn away from love, Sailor... Don't turn away from love... Don't turn away from love.
I'm sorry.
Yes, that's so. But there is not much to destroy.
In many capacities.
He served his time for what he did. Another thing... If Lula went with him of her own volition - willingly, that is - there ain't much can be done about it.
Marietta, settle down now darlin'... I want what's best for her, too - like I said, I'll do what I can to bring her home.
I won't tell you over the phone. I'm comin' to N.O. and I'll tell you then.
Somethin' was upsettin' you bad last night, and you wanted to tell me and I figured you wanted to tell me so's I could help...
Yeah... The one that introduced Santos to you and Clyde.
Like you, sweetheart. You and your daddy got the same mouth, eyes, ears, and nose. Only difference is your color hair is like mine.
Peanut...
'Bout fifty thousand times. I got us a room at the Cape Fear, and guess what?... I hear Powermad's at "The Hurricane."
Started he couldn't remember things? Got real violent? Mama kept tellin' me it was on account of lead poisoning from cleanin' the old paint off our house without usin' a mask... But I don't know. Seems like his brain just fell apart in pieces.
But honey, I thought you told me your Uncle Pooch raped you when you was thirteen.
Sorry, sugar. Go on and tell me how old Pooch done the deed.
No, he picked me up.
'We' did it? Whattaya mean? Didn't he force you?
That woman's laugh creeps me out. I heard somethin' like that... somewhere before... Sound'd like the wicked witch...
We didn't have no TV up at Pee Dee, baby, you know?
Hell, why should the Datin' Game be different from real life? At least them boys is gonna get somethin' to eat.
What happened to him?
Hell, peanut...
Sound like ol' Dell's more'n just a little confused, peanut... Too bad he couldn't visit that ol' Wizard of Oz and get some good advice.
What's that?
Maybe my mama cares for me just a little too much...
Maybe two, three months after Juarez. I was visitin' my cousin, Junior Train, in Savannah, and we were at some kid's house whose parents were out of town. A girl comes up to me that was real tall, taller than me.
You got about six more big states to go before we find out.
Yeah, I guess, but - and here's the lesson part - they ain't supposed to be so bad for you.
Thank the Lord. Well, you ain't let me down yet, Sailor. That's more'n I can say for the rest of the world?
Got anyplace special in mind?
Come look at this.
I got one on me at Lake Lanier. Lifeguard poured salt on it and it dropped off. Felt awful. He was a cute boy, though, so it was almost worth it.
Sailor? You expect me to believe a man'd be goin' around with a arm sewed to his nose?
Honest, Lula. I prob'ly ain't precisely got all the facts straight, but it's about what they said.
You really are dangerously cute, honey. I gotta admit it.
One person thinks he's doin' somethin' good and ever'body else gets upset about it.
Ever imagine what it'd be like to get eaten alive by a wild beast? Sometimes I think it would be the biggest thrill?
Shhhhh... It's four o'clock... That woman's laugh the other day had somethin' to do with this feelin'?... Like bein' ripped apart by a gorilla, maybe... Grabbed sudden and pulled apart real quick by a real powerful one.
Too bad they don't give an award for talkin'... You'd win first prize. Especially with those tits.
No, I like gettin' up around four a.m. and talkin' bout wild animals... Though you woke me up this time in the middle of a dream. I kinda wish I didn't remember it. Up at Pee Dee, I couldn't remember any of my dreams.
You do.
Pardon me? Y'all got a phone here I can use?
It's me who's wastin' time, Sailor, bein' with you.
Not in Houston. We'd be better off in some place more out of the way.
This ain't news, sweetheart. I hate to tell ya.
Well, there's a good side as well as a bad side to it... The good side is I knew your daddy, and I thought Clyde was a good ol' guy...
Yes I did... I sure did... The bad side of it is I did some drivin' for a man named Marcello Santos...
If you say so.
What's that?
Fan works.
Love you, too.
Shake hands with your daddy.
It's a mistake, honey. You two go on. I'll walk back to the depot.
Damn!
Why, how could I not worry? Not knowin' what's happenin' to you or where you are? Are you with that boy?
You in a dance hall or somethin'? I can hear music behind you.
Got any plans?
Yes.
Yes... Get rid of him.
Santos...
Yes.
In the head.
Yes.
No... In the brains... What little I'm sure he has.
Santos... No... Please, Santos...
You're gonna have to kill me to keep me away from Lula.
I didn't see nothin'...
The candelabras were my Gran's.
Hhhuh. So we decoy her. Stick a couple pillows and one of your teddy bears under the spread and she won't know the difference.
He's right, you look horrible.
How are you, Crabtree?
It was Jerry Nathan's. He owed me money.
Piss off, Crabs. I lost a wife today.
Sara and Walter declined. Guess they wanted to go home and curl up on the couch with the dog.
Come on. Crabs. Don't do this. He's one of my students, for Christ sake. I'm not even sure if he's --
Because... because...
What? Ohhhh. Is that... it?
His parents.
Only in your bones?
What's to tell?
It's just ail that crap he spins out. Just once I'd like to know if the little bastard is telling the truth.
First I see if Hannah will let me borrow her car.
Only now I'm starting to think the car wasn't exactly Jerry's to give.
My guess -- Vernon Hardapple.
'That's my car, motherfucker.'
...we find the jacket.
Call it a hunch.
I have an alternate version of the first chapter.
Ah. Well. Congratulations. Meanwhile, what is James supposed to do? Pray for Walter Gaskell to come to his?
Gee, I don't know, Crabs...  Improvise. You're good at that.
Jeff. Sorry. I didn't even know this was your house until about an hour ago.
Hey, Jeff. If you're really interested in discussing that business with the tango, try the guy at the end of the hall.
So I hear. You've also been smoking a lot of marijuana, I understand.
I spoke with the woman who saved your life. You're lucky she came along when she did.
You've got a gun, motherfucker. Drop it!
Shoot.
No sweat. Only do me a favor?
With Emily?
Yea?
...You carry firearms.
I have trouble sleeping. While I'm lying in bed I figure them out. The stories.
I'll miss my bus.
Like the lady herself.
I guess you must be, if you know the combination to his closet and he doesn't mind your being here in their bedroom like this.
He's dead, James. Believe me, I know a dead dog when I see one.
She is. Ah. Here we go...
Most of the time he is, James. Some of the time he isn't. Now what do we have here?
Is he all right?
What's he saying?
Sure.
What'd he say?
What'd you tell him?
That's a big book you're writing.
Wow, Hannah always swore you were working, but --
Hm.
Jesus, James, you should've told someone.
Shit, James, you're hungover. What do you think's the matter with you?
Your father worked in a mannequin factory?
Maybe I just needed the moment to present itself.
You're mad at me, aren't you?
James, fall semester, first day of class, it was 95 degrees and you were wearing the coat.
Spells? Jesus, James, you make it sound like we're in a Tennessee Williams play. I don't have spells.
James. Listen. Things -- things are a little weird with me right now and I -- well --I have enough blame to shoulder these days without having to take the blame if something bad happened to you. And if you hang around me long enough, something bad is going to happen, trust me. That's why I need you to go home. Understand?
I'm sorry about all that. I just -- I don't like to talk about my family. They treat me like a freak.  She makes me sleep in the basement of my own house. It's mine. My parents left it to me.
I'm fine, right. Fit as a fucking fiddle.
It's Walter's dog and yes, she does know. But let's spare her the details. Come on, your shoes are in the hail.
Don't be. I don't care if they expel me. I probably should be expelled.
I think maybe we're missing the point. It seems to me James' strength as a writer is that he doesn't take us by the hand. He treats us like adults. He respects us enough to forget us. That takes... courage.
Just checking.
Ail right. By the way, his friend...?
James'll know about George Sanders.
James is odd. I know he has an aunt in Sewickley Heights. I dropped him there once, but...  Come to think of it, it wasn't even his Aunt's house. He said she worked there. Or something. I don't remember.
Hh-uh. Last time I saw it was...
The one in your office? It's the best one for naps.
Who does?
I don't know, Grady. I just dropped him on a corner.
It beats 'What's your major?'
Sure. The keys are on the dresser next to... to your book.
Chancellor.
That's funny. I need to talk to you, too.  Perhaps you could put some of these coats in the upstairs guest room, Professor Tripp.
Well then. I'd better show you. Terry --
Yes.
You love Emily. I know that. And you need to stay with her.
She'll come back. That's why I'm going to... to not have this baby.
It's -- it's a souvenir. Of Baltimore.
You got me.
I know that. I know what's at stake here...
About the baby.
It seems one of our students is -- missing and his parents found a dead dog in his bed.
Are you sure you parked it there?
Some times...
Why yes. How did you know?
It's a bathtub. What she's standing under.
I don't know. It might be...
Why did you come here, Grady?
I might have his number on campus.
No, I'm going ho --
I haven't heard of half of those.
I doubt I'd recognize a '63 Chateau Latour if I was sitting on it.
You want to keep him happy.
Something wrong with that?
You're the only one in the family who still talks to me.
How old is Anna?
Only if it's no closer than a hundred feet.
It wasn't like that.
Mariners are pounding the shit out of the Tigers.
When?
Tell Annette I'm busy in July.
You should see my appointment book. It got crazy.
The mother sure has her hands full.
When I go bird-watching. It's why I like coming here.
Their sound is quite musical.
It's a bright sound.
It's good to listen to your daddy.
I have friends.
Cop.
Got something to hide?
You going to take me on a nature walk?
Fairy tales?
Know what?
I was asleep.
You said last night. I went to bed pretty early.
I went to bed around seven.
I suppose if you're looking for a male between the ages of thirty and fifty, medium height, medium weight, medium build. Probably not too many men fit that bill.
You're a cop. Figure it out.
It's a free country, isn't it?
Yeah, Mary-Kay, I think I do. Thanks a bunch for the advice.
Can I ask how old you are?
Do you have many friends?
It sounds like you were banished.
They sound like finches.
Does he?
Do you like it when he asks you?
Ms. Kramer.
I can't.
What will happen if I do?
I know because... it's just something I know.
Robin, listen to me.
The job's okay.
What?
Reflect.
You think reflection is good.
No fucking way.
I don't need someone else.
You know why. It's part of the parole deal.
They usually tell me.
I know --
I know you're frustrated, Walter, but --
What did you think would happen?
Is this the first one?
I want you to calm down.
I want to talk about it now.
Remember when you asked me what my idea of "normal" was?
Now I know. It's when I can see a girl, be near a girl, even talk to a girl... and walk away.  That's my idea of being normal.
Okay. Eyes closed, mind a blank. I'm all yours. Do it, Rosen.
I don't see --
In my bed, Rosen. Where do you think?
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have been there.
I smelled her hair. That's it. I just liked smelling her hair.
Time.
People without cars.
What?
Of course. Sorry. I'm such a fucking asshole.
Maybe later.
I molested little girls.
Hey, I'm not --
No. Never again.
You don't really --
Don't be sorry for me. I did those things. No one else did. I'm dealing with that.
Why young girls, Walter?
I was always the one seduced.
Well, most people are stupid.  You want to talk about odds? One day I'll tell you how I survived as the youngest in a family of three sons. You wanna talk about odds?
Which brother did this?
No you don't.
I'm not scared.
I think it's a fucking good idea.
You're such an asshole.
Nothing.
I told him we had to get the umbilical unhooked ASAP.
Where're you?
We were due to go back out on the same ship. Six months of tests.  If you were married you got a state-room.  Otherwise it was bunks.
Well, you know Lindsey, too damn aggressive-- Son of a--!!
Kirkhill?  That guy doesn't know his butt from a rathole.  Hey, Perry!
How deep's the drop-off here?
Missile compartment.  Those are the launch tubes.
I... they're all dead, Bud.  They're all dead. I thought... some of them... you know...
No!  I'm okay now.  I just don't... I can't go any further in.
Yeah, okay.  Okay.
Hi, Lins.  I thought you were in Houston.
Not even when it meant something.  Is that One Night up in Flatbed?
Yeah, what's-his-name wouldn't like it.  The Suit.
I saw something!  I'm not going to go back there and say I didn't see it when I did.  I'm sorry.
Yeah.  So sue me.
You noticed.
'Course is worked.  You're never wrong, are you? How d'you feel.
Hello, Mrs. Brigman.
I'm not interested in your way of doing things. Just get your team ready to dive.
No.
Check.  Then I just hang with these guys, right?
Yeah.  The dude's in bad shape... you see his hands?
Got it. Over.
Yeah!  I mean, I don't know... it looks right.
Missed what?
What good's the money if your dick drops off in six months?
Just checking is out, huh?  How come?
We've been fully briefed, Mrs. Brigman.
Oh... chamber runs.  Uh huh, that's good.  Well, hey... you guys know any songs?
Roger, document as much as you can, but keep moving.  We're on a tight timeline.
That's 192 warheads... And how powerful are they?
Gimme a break!  Coffey, these things live three and a half miles down on the bottom of an abyssal trench!  Trust me... they're not speaking Russian.
Going over the wall.  Coming to bearing 065. Everybody stay tight and in sight.
I gotta tell you, that guy scares me a lot more than whatever's down there.  A.J. Squared Away goddamn jarhead robot.  Okay, gimme a couple hours on this.
Check this out.
It's twitching but it's below the line you said was safe.
What a question... Because I want to be with you, naturally. I hope he doesn't close the deal so he'll leave me alone at least for a few days... Isn't this water wonderful!
You'll get over it soon. It's the usual anxiety.
What! After giving us such a run around...
This one is gorgeous.
You already know what they are.
It's the same thing. Goodbye, dear.
It takes about twenty to twenty-two hours for the current to reach here from Lisca Bianca.
Look... I'd like to get back to Lisca Bianca.
At what?
Well, what?
I'm sorry about last night. Please forgive me.
Yes, maybe that is better.
I don't know why. I just couldn't help it.
What! Get married?
What do I say? What can I say? No. At least, not yet. I don't know... I can't even think of it... at a time like this... Oh, but why did you have to ask me?
As soon as you're ready, you can come down and catch up with me. I'll be waiting for you right outside on the square.
Nothing.
Why?
And aren't you pleased?... That way you'll have a new kind of adventure.
I don't doubt it. But at a time like this we're the least suitable persons to be with him. And as far as telephoning him... Who knows where he is?
Aren't you going to change?
Why?
One would have to be in love with somebody to know that.
Just several days ago, the thought of Anna being dead would have made me sick. And now, I don't even cry, I'm afraid she might be alive. Everything is becoming so damned simple and easy, even to deprive one's self of pain and suffering.
Yes, you're right. I'm sick and tired of being like that.
I detest comparisons made with oil.
Listen, Marshal... As for there being reasons for going away, anyone of us might have three thousand of them. So you can assume that she had them. What I want to know, is it possible that the smugglers might have taken her aboard?
What is it?
What has everybody got against me this morning?
I know we are. But as the years go by, we become even worse. Isn't that so, Corrado?
I thought the model was something obsolete nowadays. Didn't you, Claudia?
Answer me, why don't you try posing? I'll paint you a beautiful portrait.
Yes, sir. My sister is sick... and my father, too.
Now look, my men saw it and they also saw you men throwing those crates overboard. What have you got to say about that?
No. The owners are in Australia.
What boat?
Good. Then I'll meet you there.
Ettore must be fed up with me by now.
Lady Patrizia!
He talked to you Himself?
Through someone else?
Who?
... You needn't worry about being attractive here.
That's not what he meant.
Your mother tells you this?... Agnes your mother is dead.
No.
I burnt them.
It's not that... it's not that...
I don't know... I don't know...
Yes.
Oh, I know he does.
Where did the baby come from?
Where'd it come from before that?
Just that... you ask and I'll answer.
Oh, they frighten me, I'm afraid I'll drop them. They have a soft spot on their heads and if you drop them so they land on their heads they become stupid. I was dropped on my head, that's why I don't understand things.
I hope not. It's a terrible thing to be dropped on your head.
Oh, it's even more wonderful then.
She knew what was going to happen to me. That's why she hid me away.
Somebody told her.
No.
From someone who didn't want to have a baby.
I can't help it if I'm stupid.
I was a mistake.
Yes.
... makes me...
Her headaches.
And then...
Do you really love me or are you just saying that?
To help me.
Because I'm in trouble.
Yes.
It grew.
No.
I left early because I wasn't feeling very well.
Sister Marguerite I think.
Are you ill?
I don't know which one 
Why?
Who?
Of course you do. Who was it?
Agnes?  Who?  Mother Superior?
No... no, excuse me Eve. As quickly as I see fit.
What's the matter with you, you've seen the reports. It's a cut and dried case.
What about Roger? He's free.
You have proof?
You know Martha never comes to see me. You watch it, she's going straight to hell... after all the things she said to me. Then she marries that son of a bitch of a Frenchman... has an abortion. I knew that one wouldn't work out. Not like you Marie. You got married to God.
How do you survive?
Well that's a lot of land. You must have help. Do you have field hands that help you?
The one up on the third floor?
Uh huh.
She undressed alone... she bathed alone.
None as far as I know.
Father Martineau, but I don't see him as a candidate.
Obviously there was.
Believe me, I've done everything possible short of asking Agnes.
Look, someone gave her the baby.
The science of psychiatry.
I am not with the Inquisition.
What's your opinion?
From other nuns...  Yes I... I've noticed.
So, someone else could have done it.
That she was unconscious, yes!  So someone easily could have come in the room and killed the...
When did you first learn about her... innocence, the way she thinks?
And what happened?
It was healed by the following morning and she started eating again...
What?
... or bullied or what ever you're doing. Who the hell do you think you are?  You go around here expecting applause for the way you treated this child.
And she has a right to know that there's a world out there filled with people who don't believe in God...  ... and aren't any worse off than you Mother. People who've gone through their entire lives without bending their knees once, to anybody. And people who fall in love and have babies and occas- sionally are very happy. She has a right to know that. But you and your... your order and your Church have kept her ignorant...
Aquittal.
Yes.
What is it?
The twenty third of January. On that night one of our elder nuns passed away.
I never saw Agnes until she set foot in this convent. My sister ran away from home. We lost touch with her. And when my husband died and I came here, she wrote to me and asked me if I would take care of Agnes in case anything happened.
She's happy with us and she could go on being happy if she was left alone.
Do you suppose the saints would have smoked if tobacco had been popular back then?
Long, thin and filtered.
Hand rolled.
Right...
There are no saints today. Good people yes, but extraordinarily good people... those I'm afraid we are sorely lacking.
Become?  One is born a saint.
You're what?
You think she's a saint?
Who is he?
My God, you're as crazy as...
Why would I lie?
Is it because she's a nun?
That's a lie.
I didn't hide it. I put it there for the blood and the dirty sheets.
No!
I left it with her and I went for help.
Just you?
Not much cop without 'em, is it?
What they like?
Isn't it always the way? Picking on us little fellas.
Yeah.
Please do, I'll not need them for fifteen minutes. Thank you.
Oh, surely one can have a tiny touch.
Spoil sport!
Oh, yes, now I'm with you. [he changes his accent] But, gee, Mister, I've got my license to think of ... we're doing a hundred now ...
Oh, by all means, I'd be quite prepared for that eventuality.
I wouldn't be seen dead in them. They're dead grotty.
Have I said something amiss?
It is, y'know.
A butcher?
No, straight up.
No. I mean, it's probably a honeymoon couple or a company director or something.
The old mixer, come on we'll have to put him right.
What do you expect from an ad lib ... Raymond Chandler?
You're getting out of hand. I don't know what's come over you today.
Come here.
Well, it must be catching. He's given it to the champ here.
How'd you guess?
I'm in a group ... well ... there are four of us, we play and sing.
Quite right, invites to gambling dens full of easy money and fast women, chicken sandwiches and cornets of caviar, disgusting!
Books are good!
Get Lloyd George over there with that mechanic in the cloth cap while I sort this lot out.
Hello.
Before you go, I think it's only fair to warn you about me Grandson ... don't let our Paul have his own way all the time, 'cos if you do he won't respect you!
Every morning.
You're left-handed, aren't you, Paul?
And I take a left-handed view of life, I've got to.
We've just finished, Pauly. Hey George, write us your John Henry on this picture.
For Ringo.
Hiding.
No ... it was his sweetbreads. She was dead kinky for sweetbreads. Anyroad, me mother thought it'ud give him a change of scenery, like.
Eh, don't take out me lines.
Nothing, he's trying to brainwash me and give me personality doubts ... oh, he's a swine but a clever swine, mind.
Can't he? He's done it, son!
Practising to be thick-headed, you're there already.
You're a swine, isn't he George?
He started it.
Hello the income tax have caught up with us at last.
It's all right for you, you couldn't get a pen in your foot, you swine.
We were going to do it.
Tonight? We can't make it ...
No, not me.
No, I'm not.
I knew I could rely on you.
I don't need you to defend me, y'know, Norm.
Someone put it on me.
But...
Oh, all right. Come here, Grandad.
I can't help it, I'm just taller than you.
Get knotted!
You can't trust you with anything, Norm, if you've lost him, I'll cripple you.
Oh, him... He's been lurking.
I've got a little list here. Wandering abroad. Malicious intent. Acting in a suspicious manner. Conduct liable to cause a breach of the peace. You name it, he's done it.
Kill drive engines.
Then take her down.
Yeah, I'm okay.  Haven't hit bottom yet.  Definitely a column of warm air rising; it keeps the shaft clear of dust.
God I'm hungry.
It is none of the 678 dialects spoken by technological man.
Hard to say.
What?
Jay, we've got a problem.  I was wondering if there was any way you could shortcut the repairs and give us immediate takeoff capability.
The computer's translated the alien signal, and it's kind of alarming.
We have to avoid injuring it.  What we really need is some electric animal prods.
Machine's screwed up, I can't tell. Needle's spinning all over the dial.
Dead.
Is it alive?
Well... I'm going to have to blow the engines out...
Here, let me try.
I kind of like it.
We could put on our pressure suits and blow all the air out of the ship.  That would kill it.
<u>He's</u> the only one that knows that.
Yeah, but how?  His nose and mouth are blocked.
How about cutting it off?  We can't pull it loose, but we can cut off everything but the bottom layer, where it's stuck to his face.
It's eating a hole in the floor!
Isn't there some way we can get it off him?
You can't tell -- that kind of stuff could represent printed circuits...
I'll come with you.
Good.  Get on it.  But first, I'm issuing a standing order: from this moment forth, every one of us will wear protective garments, including helmets.  Let's get down to the locker and change.
Sounds like a rough one.
At least it can't get up here now.
That's right -- we can't kill it on the ship, but we can at least keep it at bay -- and maybe drive it into the air lock.
I don't buy that.  There's still time to destroy it and get ourselves in the freezers.
Good!  That's good!
I've completely lost their signal.
I'm trying.
And right next to it, that oval design with the markings -- it's a dead ringer for the spore casings.
Feast your eyes.
My signal's fading.
I couldn't make it out -- too much interference.
Let's let the machine work on him.
Reminded me of when I was a kid and the roof leaked -- everybody running for the pots and pans.
I was thinking of a line from an old poem: "Water, water everywhere, but not a drop to drink."  All that space out there, and we're trapped in this ship.
We're the new pioneers, Chaz.  We even have our own special diseases.
Are they close?
Let's get moving with this net.
Close...
That tube must be depositing it in him.
What's the matter, you don't like this stuff?
No -- that's atmosphere.  Cloud layer.
Turn on navigation lights.
Sandy... how far are we from the source of the transmission?
What killed it?
Is that its mouth?
Look, I'm not trying to rub anybody's nose in anything.  The important thing is just to get away from here as fast as possible.
Up one kilometer, Jay.
You bet we made it.  Martin, set course for Irth and accelerate us into stardrive.
Quit complaining; we're in space.
It started crashing around right after we locked it in.
Once we kill the thing we won't need the food any more -- we can go straight into hypersleep.  Also, it sounds like that thing is already doing a pretty good job on our supplies; it may be fouling them all.
Go ahead, Jay.
Well... yes... there's a pattern... but it's meaningless to me.
Right... but it'll take a few minutes for the engines to overheat and melt down the core.  In the meantime, we get in the lifeboat and leave the ship.
Yeah... I forgot.
And you'll let me know when you've got it coming this way...
Well, just keep looking.  It's gotta be... whoa, Jesus!
God, I hope that thing didn't bring down a virus.
Yep...
Okay, give me the numbers.
Get her on-line.  Now!
You win some, you loose some.
Match it!
Hey!  I was in shape before we started doing this.
What?
How?
No, he's stopped; he's totally still. Just take it nice and easy, babe. Nice and easy...
Okay.
Give me twenty minutes and I'll do it myself.
Have you got an updated Lloyds' Almanac to cross-reff them through?
Just give them the facts.  They can leap to their own conclusions.
What?  Why?
Forget it.  I wouldn't ask somebody to do something I wouldn't do myself.  Where's the disk?
Right.  Auto-shop, you all set?
Not too much of the socializing type, then?
Nothing.  With the satellite down, we can't transmit over the mountain range. He's most likely sitting there wondering why he can't raise us.
Check out the tent.
Ackland?  I don't know him well enough to say.  If we were back on Earth we could run him though an Aldhoven test and find out for sure. There's not much we can do out here.
Detour.  Other way's blocked...
Camped out by the navi-beacon out on Linson's Range.  They're making their own way back tomorrow.
What time's sundown?
I consider myself lucky they didn't throw things.
Please do.
That's right.
Yes. I do.
Eddie...
I hope you mean what you say, Eve. I intend to hold you to it.
And tomorrow morning you will have won your beachhead on the shores of Immortality...
Almost four.
Lloyd and I.
What else?
The setting wasn't romantic, but Lloyd was. He woke me up at three in the morning, banging on my door - he couldn't sleep, he told me - he's left Karen, he couldn't go on with the play or anything else until I promised to marry him... we sat and talked until it was light. He never went home...
I never intended you to be.
- it's important right now that we talk. Killer to killer.
Then if you won't get out, I'll have you thrown out.
Answer my question! Weren't you paid to get out of town?
I was there, I saw you and heard you through the dressing room door!
Yes, Addison.
Why not?
Max has gone to a great deal of trouble, it's going to be an elaborate party, and it's for you.
Now there's something a girl could make sacrifices for.
Why do they always look like unhappy rabbits?
As soon as the peasants stop pawing her.
Margo.
Completely. Nor, I am sure, could anyone else present tell you how Miss Caswell read or whether Miss Caswell read or rode a pogo stick.
A mass of music and fire. That's me. An old kazoo and some sparkles. Tell me - was Bill swept away, too, or were you too full of Revelation to notice?
The air lines have clocks, even if you haven't! I start shooting a week from Monday - Zanuck is impatient, he wants me, he needs me!
Where?
Geniuses don't need good luck.  I do.
Did she tell you about the Theater and what it meant?
I'll try.
- in a tin can, cellophane or wrapped in a Navajo blanket, I want you home...
A big hurry, be quick about it - so good night, darling, and sleep tight...
It's no secret, I know all about the party - Eve wrote me...
She hasn't missed a week since I left - but you know all that, you probably tell her what to write... anyway, I sent her a list of people to ask - check with her.
How is Eve? Okay?
To put me to bed? Take my clothes off, hold my head, tuck me in, turn off the lights, tiptoe out...? eve would. Wouldn't you, Eve?
I thought you were going to be late-
Stage-struck kid... she's a young lady - of qualities. And I'll have you know I'm fed up with both the young lady and her qualities! Studying me as if - as if I were a play or a set of blueprints! How I walk, talk, think, eat, sleep!
For instance - you!
What about her teeth? What about her fangs?
You've been all through that with Lloyd-
I didn't know Eve Harrington was your understudy until half past two this afternoon!
I think you do know but you won't or can't tell me.  I said before it was going to be my last try, and I meant it. I can't think of anything else to do. I wish I could.  We usually wind up screaming and throwing things as the curtain comes down. Then it comes up again and everything's fine. But not this time.  You know there isn't a playwright in the world who could make me believe this would happen between two adult people. Goodbye, Margo.
He does not exaggerate. I was good.
You've got it backwards. Even for Wilkes-Barre.
Groom.
A married lady.
Eve. Eve Harrington.
Why you have to go out there.
I just asked a simple question.
Of course not.
Goodbye, Mr. Sampson.
So am I.
I'm for it.
Your make-up's a little heavy.
Buy some.
You don't have to apologize for me!  I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings. It's just my way of talkin'...
Like an agent with one client.
What for?
I'll just pick up the broken glass.
Subway.
I don't care if I never get home.
I hope you don't mind my speaking to you...
But if I'd known... maybe some other time... I mean, looking like this.
Eve. Eve Harrington.
It couldn't possibly interest you.
I'll be at the old stand, tomorrow matinee-
Some Hollywood movie star, her plane got in late.
Hollywood.
Lloyd says Margo compensates for underplaying on the stage by overplaying reality...  ... next to that sable, my new mink seems like an old bedjacket...  ... you've done your share, Eve. You've worked wonders with Margo...
Karen.
I don't intend to be.
- and easy or not, I won't believe a word.
I wish I'd never met him, I'd like him to be dead... I want my friends back.
I wish I could believe that.
When he gets too close, I'll spit in his eye.
It seems I can't think of a thing you haven't thought of...
I was telling Margo and Lloyd about how often you'd seen the play...
Roughly ten minutes.
More than anything in this world, I love Bill. And I want Bill. I want him to want me. But me. Not Margo Channing. And if I can't tell they apart - how can he?
Those years stretch as the years go on. I've seen it happen too often.
Silly, isn't it? You'd think they'd fix it so people could just sit in a car and keep warm...
I can't believe Eve said those things!
Loud.
The critics thought so, the audiences certainly think so - packed houses, tickets for months in advance - I can't see that either of Lloyd's last two plays have hurt you any!
Then a childish, heavy-handed routine about not knowing Eve was her understudy-
- everything a playwright first thinks of wanting to write about... until his play becomes a vehicle for Miss Channing...
Margo. Margo's great. She knows it. That's the trouble. She can play Peck's Bad Boy all she wants, and who's to stop her? Who's to give her that boot in the rear she needs and deserves?
Where'd you get all that information?
Eve?
I wonder why.
Such as?
Not much.
That was way back...
And you pose as a playwright. A situation pregnant with possibilities - and all you can think of is everybody to go to sleep...
What is he talking about?
Where is she?
I know what I'm talking about, after all they're my plays...
Week after week, to thousands of people, you're as young as you want...
Perfectly innocent! Man have been hanged for less! I'm lied to, attacked behind my back, accused of reading your silly dialogue inaccurately - as if it were Holy Gospel!
City Hall, that's for prize fighters, and reporters - I see a cathedral, a bishop, banks of flowers...
Lloyd, I want you to be big about this... the world is full of love tonight, no woman is safe...
Well. I don't want to play "Cora."
What's your being married got to do with it?
Poor Max. Heartburn?  It's that Miss Caswell. I don't know why she doesn't give Addison heartburn.
The situation I'm in ain't the kind you can belch your way out. I made a promise...
A couple of weeks.
Would you?
Margo, I wouldn't think of taking that girl away from you...
Answer my question!
--it was bullshit the way it was--
--mine's better--
--read 'em both and you'll see--
Mainly it has to do with your choice of words.
Yeah?
What, though?  It can't be the Republicans--he'd never allow something as stupid as this, not when he's gonna slaughter McGovern anyway.
We need a sympathetic face.
I met a Presidential aide once at a social occasion.
--fifteen phone calls--
Alphabetically, on the CREEP phone list, Miss Helen Abbott of South George Street.
Facts or theory?
I just wish we knew when someone would talk to us, that's all.
--you believe in the President, you wouldn't ever want to do anything disloyal.
And I'm a Republican.
Sure.
You voted for him.
Then he's got an ax.  Call him anyway.
If he self-destructed.
--'cause I only know four chords--
--Mitchell, Stans, Magruder, Kalmbach--
Maybe we are...
--and the FBI confirms--what more do you need?--
--We got twenty minutes to deadline--
--to become President Nixon's campaign manager on March 1, Mitchell personally approved withdrawals from the fund--
This?  Naw...
Chapin did contact you then?
It gets interesting if it was Haldeman, because our word is that when Chapin says something, he's gotten the OK from Haldeman, and when Haldeman says something, he's gotten the OK from the President.
--yes--
--there's nothing new in it--
Absolutely--
Where are your bills, Carl?
Give me your checkbook then.
I don't know what they'd do to me.
It was all so crazy--the day after the break-in he gave us a speech, bouncing up and down on his heels in that loony way of his--Gordon told us not to let Jim McCord ruin everything--don't let one bad apple spoil the barrel, he said. You just know that when Gordon Liddy's calling someone a bad apple, something's wrong somewhere.  ...It's all so rotten... and getting worse... and all I care about is Hugh Sloan. His wife was going to leave him if he didn't stand up and do what was right. And he quit. He quit because he saw it and didn't want any part of it.
And that makes anything you do OK, is that it?
Because people at the Committee were told to lie to the prosecutors?
Routine--I'd just call John Mitchell over at the Justice Department and he'd say "go ahead, give out the money."
--this'll only take one second--
I'm not your source on that.
--Christ, I wish I knew if we should print this--
Where?  What do you mean, where?
--I've completely forgotten where it was, except I know it wasn't her apartment.
That checks out with our finding, thank you, Mr. Dahlberg.
I don't know maybe sixteen, eighteen hours a day--we've got sources at Justice, the FBI, but it's still drying up.
To where?
What's the whole thing about--do you know?
Ratfucking.
Why didn't they?--who told them not to?
Mitchell knew then.
Total manipulation. I suppose you could say they wanted to subvert the Constitution, but they don't think along philosophical lines.
I was being cautious.  You can safely say more then fifty...
--yes, yes, what is it?
The C.I.A.
Some Justice Department lawyers and an FBI man, and some people from the Committee to Re-Elect, yes ma'am.
--nobody gives a shit about the Dahlberg repercussions--
--this White House guy, a good one, a pro, came up and asked what is this Watergate compulsion with you guys and I said, well, we think it's important and he said, if it's so goddamn important, who the hell are Woodward and Bernstein?
--well, what if your boys get it wrong--
Preliminary hearing at Superior Courthouse?
Lotsa hints--
I don't get it--you were the one who wanted to fire him.
--go over your sources again--
Absolutely.
Larry Young, a California lawyer--
You handed out the money. Maybe there's a legitimate explanation for the way it was done--
One thing I'm not completely clear on--when you gave out the money to Liddy, how did that work?
--I already get the Post. I don't need another subscription.
Sorry.
-- Thanks, coach --
You need some work, buddy!
Like what?
I'm not good in math.
You'll see.  Gotta go.  Sixteen minute round trip.
Seduce her.
Why is this?
So Oz, you almost made it, huh?
Of course, I didn't --
Oh...well that's okay.  Cool.
You can call me Oz.
Oh, please.  I asked you because I thought you might actually be worth going with.  But you are just a jock. No wait.  You're a jerk.
Because I want to.
How did you know I was here?
Yeah, well my parents wanted me to go to Northwestern.  I didn't want to write all those extra essays they make you do -- I mean, how am I supposed to know what my "most emotionally significant moment" was?  So when my U of M acceptance came in December, I said the hell with it.
Oh thank God, I thought I was the only one.
Yeah right.
Vicky, it's not a space shuttle launch, it's sex.  So did you do the physics write-up?
No comment?!  Are you kidding me?! I've never seen someone's image change so...so drastically!
I don't get it, that really works?
Yeah, I'm the best, baby.
Oh yeah, baby, I'll give it to you.
Finch, you got the Latin homework?
So, does my hair look better --  like this, or...  like this?
Pontificated.
Right.  That gives us...
Well...dammit, if I'm doing this, how the hell am I gonna watch?
Jesus, Kevin, rub it in.
No, but come on guys, we made a pact!
Yeah.
Nothing!
Yeah, sure.
These are for you.  From father to son.
Is it because we have a test tomorrow? Sometimes I get cranky when I know I have a big test to study for.
I thought so.  Because, one time?  I was at this --
Michelle.
Cool!  We're gonna have so much fun! It's like this one time, at band camp...
I told you.
No -- Kevin, you?
Hey Sherman.  Scopin' the babes.
Well, I do have ballet practice. Perhaps I can come by your house afterwards.  I can change clothes at your place?
Do you mind?  This fabric is so uncomfortable.
For me?
Oh no.
This just got a hell of a lot better.
Oh no, Stifler, what did you do?
Okay, don't stop.
No, I'm not.  I'm writing a sequence of random numbers that look like I'm doing the extra credit problems.  Mr. Bender doesn't bother to check homework past April.
Yeah, we have.  You corrupted my four- point into a three-nine-five.
Well, I feel that...things are getting to that point in a relationship. When two people share...a special moment between them.
No, I don't not love you.  I like, I know that we've definitely got <u>something</u> between us.  Something good. Something special.
Yeah, we have something great, Vick.
Wow, Kev...it's perfect.
Me too.
I want to hear you say it.
Don't say that, we can do it somehow. It might not be perfect, but --
What was I gonna do, call dad?  I don't even know his number.
Yeah, well anyway...I thought you might have some advice, brother to brother.  I mean, I think tonight she might, we might really, there's a chance that -- you know.
What?  Not <u>the</u> Bible?
Well, no.  I think...I guess it would be good to be able to return the favor.  I mean, it would be nice to know she enjoys things as much as I do.
What's that?
How the hell do you know all these random songs?
No shit, I'm never gonna get laid. How the hell am I gonna become this Mr. Sensitive Man?
He didn't?
I think we're falling in love.
Dude, watch me work.  They go for sensitive studs like me.
Well, just don't expect Oz to pay for the limo.
I'll bet you do, you little horndog, she's givin' you fuckin' stiffies, right?
No shit.
Uh huh.
Just like sex with my wife.
Hope I didn't hurt him too bad.
Yeah, that's the word. And you are?
Police. They have their head in their asshole and they still can't find shit.
Hey, Sorry if I was out of line.
In an underground club? I'd like to see that.
You must get out of here. It's not safe.
Serafine...?
Yeah... Ditto. I saw, er, I thought I saw you get munched... like Uncle Terrence...
Um... sort of... Maybe... It's all kind of blurry. We met at the club, then... Damn, that was some weird shit.
It's okay. I can see fine.
Professor Roussel. There's something wrong with you. I know it.
Are you okay?
Listen, either he wastes away as a pathetic vegetable or he can give what's left of his life to save hundreds of potential victims. He's a McDermott. I know what his choice would be.
Before Hemingway, there was Starsky and Hutch.
That's the scar where I stabbed you! Oh God... You deliberately took me down there so you could... God, I can't believe it!
I couldn't do it. Not to you.
Where?
FOR GOD'S SAKES, LET ME OUT!!
"Fuck"? You think I don't know this word "fuck"? Is that how you talk to policemen in America?
It bit me! My leg! Jesus, it's down there, shoot it! Shoot it for Christ's sakes!
You on drugs? Huh?
Shhh! Be quiet, man! We're not alone -
Or else what? You'll kill me?
Yeah, okay. Just gimme a minute to freshen up.
Oh no... no....
This is... it's like a sick joke, I -
Yeah?
My God! Serafine's right. It's time to go. We'll talk soon.
What?... Oh, right, you can see these guys too. Jesus... 
It's chemistry, Andy. Nothing more. Mutated antigens concentrated in the heart of the infector unlock a vaccine- like chain reaction in the infectee. There were not many bio-chemists working in the twelfth century, but with today's technology it's possible to synthesize any chemical imaginable. When I discovered this ancient cure I knew who to go to.
Sort of...
I went to St. Severin church.  Now look -
That's McDermott, but yeah.
How well did, er, do you know him?
Aaaaa!!! Get the fuck away from me!
Don't worry. In a few seconds you won't feel a thing.
I told you. These murders are not normal.
Allo?
Serafine? Is that you? What's going on?
You fucking liar!
Okay. So maybe you were right.
I'm not sure but look. . .
Who's Sophie?
I don't have a memory and I'm not a Princess!  Even if I were - no one's ever going to believe it. I'm not exactly...
I'm sorry. . .  I'm. . .
Who are you?!
What happened to your parents?
I was all out of dynamite!
No!
You are the Princess.
Well, the only thing you've got when you've got a home is a fear of losing it! You're lucky you don't remember the revolution -- I never had much, but what I did have -- I lost.
Tell me it isn't true?! Tell me you didn't do this for the money!
I don't know! I don't want to hurt you...
THINGS MY HEAR USED TO KNOW THINGS IT YEARS TO REMEMBER
Don't worry about that now, child, it will all come back to you now that you're home...
No, it wasn't a bat! I saw this horrible man - I remember him, I think...
She leads a charmed life, that little one ... Someone is always there to save her. In the palace as a child, on the train and now ... it's him.
He's her?
She found her home. Maybe it's time I found one too!
The same thing I wanted ten years ago - all the Romonovs dead I got the others, now I have to finish up with that nuisance, Anastasia...
STOP IT! I DID SO KILL THEM! And I'm going to kill Anastasia.
You! How dare you?! Stop this car immediately!
I should go
After all I've done for your family - YOU TRIED TO KILL MEEEEEE ! ! !
Oh good! We haven't seen an Anastasia in several days!
This guy's on television.
Alvy, you are totally incapable of enjoying life.
that I've got to... ah... ah... They're gonna laugh at him for a couple minutes, then I gotta go out there, I gotta ... get laughs, too. How much can they laugh?  They-they they're laughed out.
Well, I'm getting tired of it. I need your attention.
You're using this conspiracy theory as an excuse to avoid sex with me.
Alright, alright, I'm in a bad mood, okay?
Well, I'm sorry, I-I can't... I-I- I've gotta see a picture exactly from the start to the finish, 'cause- 'cause I'm anal.
Well, he's spitting on my neck! You know, he's spitting on my neck when he talks.
M'm, I don't know, sometimes I ask myself how I'd stand up under torture.
That movie makes me feel guilty.
Okay, it's in. It's definitely in the pot!
All right! All right! All right! All right! Whatta yuh mean? Are yuh gonna take pictures now?
Hey, that was last year.
Oh, why-uh... y-y-you gotta car?
Oh, no, I have a car.
Wisconsin.
Huh? Oh... yeah.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
No, I know, but... but, you know, I'm all perspired and everything.
Me? No, no, no, 'cause I never shower in a public place.
You're gonna sing? Do you sing? Well, no, it isn't  No kidding?  this is my first time. Oh, really? Where? I'd like to come.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no! No, I'm interested!
Oh, listen, so the audience was a tad restless.
No, I'm not gonna letcha. You have a great voice.
Yeah!
Oh. And your first wife was Allison?
Oh.
H'm?
That's, uh...  that's pretty serious stuff there.
Yeah?
M'hm.
U-huh.
Do I love you?
'Cause adult education's a wonderful thing. You meet a lotta interesting professors. You know, it's stimulating.
I don't know. You- It's like you're- you're removed.
Well, the twelve o'clock show is completely different than the nine.
Following is different. I was spying.
Oh, stop it. But you were having an affair with your college professor. That jerk that teaches that incredible crap course "Contemporary Crisis in Western Man"!
M'm.
You cried? I've never once cried. Fantastic...
Yeah, but you said, "Will it change my wife"!
Oh.
My God, I mean, you know how I am about insects.
Yeah.
Would you like a glass of chocolate milk?
Well, what are you doing... what are you doing with-
It's for my complexion.
Oh, yeah. Oh.  Oh! Alvy?
It's all right for me, it's been terrific, you know?  Better than either one of my marriages. See, 'cause... 'cause there's just something different about you. I don't know what it is, but it's great.
Holy cow!
I don't know, I thought it might be kind of fun, you know what I mean, it'd be nice to meet some new people.
All right, all right, you don't wanna go to the party, so uh, whatta you wanna do?
Well, we never have any laughs anymore, is the problem.
And... I don't know... I mean, six months ago I-I woulda done it. I woulda done it, just to please him.
How can you say that? I mean,  who said I-I-I-I said that you, I and that girl from your acting class should sleep together in a threesome.
No, no, no that's not it at all. Alvy's giving an award on television. Gee, he talks like he's violating a moral issue sitting here.
I'm cool.
Yeah, and gradually you get old and die. You know it's important to make a little effort once in a while.
Oh-
We can always come back together again. Because there's no-there's no problem. 'Cause... Right.
Yeah.
Alvy, I can't say that that's true at this point in my life. I really just can't say that that's true. I mean, you know how wonderful you are. I mean, you know... you're the reason that I got outta my room and that I was able to sing, and-and- and, you know, get more in touch with my feelings and all that crap. Anyway, look, I don't wanna- Listen, listen, listen, uh  h'h, so whatta you up to anyway, huh?
Oh, hi, Duane, how's it goin'?
Step up here!
Six-year-old boys don't have girls on their minds.
Tell the folks where you are today, Donald.
Why are you so hostile?
No jokes-these are friends, okay?
I'm too tense. I need a Valium. My analyst says I should live in the country and not in New York.
Yeah.
Oh, no, no, don't be... tsch... don't be silly. You know,  I'm startin' it-I'm startin' to get some feeling back in my jaw now.
Key word here is "indulgent."
It's the influence of television. Yeah, now Marshall McLuhan deals with it in terms of it being a-a high, uh, high intensity, you understand?  A hot medium... as opposed to a...
Well, that's funny, because I happen to have Mr. McLuhan right here. So... so, here, just let me- I mean, all right. Come over here... a second.
Tell him.
Don't you see? The rest of the country looks upon New York like we're-we're left-wing Communist, Jewish, homosexual, pornographers. I think of us that way, sometimes, and I-I live here.
Yes, I remember.  He was all schoolyard. They threw him a football once, he tried to dribble it.
What kind of good memories, Max? Your mother and father fighting all the time.
Max, there's no crime, there's no mugging.
You're an actor, Max. You should be doing Shakespeare in the Park.
His wife has diabetes!
Lotta beautiful women. It was fun to flirt.
Uh, we just wanted to stop by and say that we really enjoyed your sets.
I though it was... very musical, and I liked it a lot.
No, I don't-I don't know, but I-I know your work. I'm a big fan of yours.
Hey-
Oh.
Yeah.
Very well.
You should talk to Mr. Joe.
You don't want that.  It's married and it's the neighbor.
The neighbors from hell.  The kind that lay in wait.  I'd rather move actually. Wouldn't I?  Wouldn't I?
Absolutely.  And she's got great tits.
The camera loves her.  A great actress.
No, what?
October-ish.
It's an object lesson in grace.  Wow!  Look who's here before me!  My leading man is on time for once.
I...wait, what are you talking about?
To dander.  Otis.
They can tell from the eyelashes, you know?  He's got eyelashes yay long.  They must be a foot long.  The older you are when you have a baby, the more likely this stuff is to crop up.
Whatever you like.  I'm afraid it'll all be too big for you.  Are you alright, Clair?
Why would she care?
Pictures.  They're always in my tote.  I left my tote in the damn trailer.  But! He's Mac all over again.  Imagine Mac shrunk to two-and-a-half feet.  The fact is they probably didn't even need me for this birth.
Yeah.
He's not going tonight.
Fuck you.
When does he graduate high school?
You really need to be fucked.
Monica.
You're crazy baby.  I love you.
Let me heal you, baby.
I don't think so.
Anytime, sport.
Fantastic.  Out here.
I adore him.
I know.  I know that.  Don't spoil it.
You invited her to our anniversary party? I didn't even invite my mother.
I'm going to throw up.
You can never be too early or too thin.
Who'd like to go and find Otis?
Okay.  Last one to find Otis is a smelly old bum.
Truce?
Whatever!  You know how he gets.  Well, he went absolutely bonkers.  Lucy and I were frantically trying to scramble into the dumb waiter and I didn't fit any more. It was almost fatal.  And that, my dear friends, is the day...
I'm worried about my spine.  I'm very worried about my brain and my spine.
Well he can't have gone far.
Sally, so I took a few pills.  I went out dancing.  I tried to forget how upset I was about splitting up with you.  I haven't lied to you.  I told you about the people I've slept with.  I just didn't mention the few occasions I took drugs because you're so fucking judgmental I knew I'd never hear the end of it, and you have so little faith and so little trust in me.  Sally, we're back, I love you.  Trust that.  Please let's not do this.
DO I want anyone else?  No.  Do I want to be with you for the rest of my natural life?  I'm trying.
That is not true.
This is insanity.  Sally...
Don't do this.
You don't have to.
Okay.
He's my favorite.
She'll never call again.  She called last week to tell me she'll never call again. Where's Sally?
Sure.
Nothing that can't be exchanged.
Congratulations on the deal.  How exciting.  Is Sally doing Sally?  I mean it's Sally.  The character that's based on Sally.  The character that's based on Sally in the book.
And so I always manage to, do you see? Like the book/script thing, do you see?
He's the best dog in the world.  They're both coming tonight.  Not my idea.
It's Jerry's worst idea.
I meant Sally.
You're an interior decorator, right?
No you're not.
And your phone calls are nasty and abusive.  And I've come this close to suing you for harassment.  And you're only here because we're supposed to be sucking up to you.
I don't think so.  I feel.  I feel a bit funny.
You're never too old for a lolly.  I'm having one.
I like you.
You know what Sally Therrian was saying about your spine and your brain?  She didn't pull that out of thin air.  It causes brain damage.  You'd better drink a lot of water.
They're nothing like us.
Why?
Let's just go home, okay?
There's a goddamn sign on the gate.
Thank you.
Really??
Not to mention Andrew Zhdanov... Otis, come!!
Yeah.
If he were still alive, maybe.
Are you asking me to marry you?
She could be playing the role in Joe's movie that should be yours.
What does that mean?
I'm worried about your Galiano.
No, really, five thousand with your discount.
At 4:30 today he barked for a solid fifteen minutes.  I have it on tape.
Well today it was Otis.  And you should keep him away from our yard.  Because Sheila will defend herself.
Rose.
I'll be right out.
Yes.
Honey, I'm not worried about you.  You are going to be a fantastic mom.  Not an issue.  I pressed you, remember?  Joe, on the other hand, is a different story.
Not nice.  Not kind.
Why are you doing this?
But I am a possessive, fragile neurotic.
Right...because every ant's important!
I work in the palace, I don't get out much.
<u>What</u>?
Oh, that's okay, I'll let him off this time.  Are you crazy?  This guy's built like a pebble!  You know they do great prosthetic antennas nowadays --
Well, if single-handedly vanquishing the enemy and slaughtering a whole nestful of termites makes someone a hero, yes I am.
SSHH!!!  SSHH!!!
Climb up that tree and get a better view!
No!  There's no such thing as "just two ants."  You never see just two ants -- you see a million ants!
Oh come on, <u>you're</u> the one who came after me -- the swarthy, earthy, sensual worker!
Well, that's an appealing offer, but...considering the options...  You go back.  Me, I'm going to Insectopia.
Want a list?
Come on...tell me there wasn't just a little...something between us that first night at the bar.  The night we danced.
Just looking for fun, adventure, trouble, I guess.
Oh no...
Superior numbers, kid!
Duty calls!
Scattered reports, sir.  Rumors. Nothing reliable.
Oh, no, sir!
Oh, of course --
Look, General!  A darling baby soldier!  Don't try to be a hero!  Just make sure you come back in one piece!  Next!
But General -- this tunnel is your baby!  You're sure you can't stay ?
Why are we so successful?
What's gonna go wrong?!  I take your place for the royal inspection.  Bala comes strolling down the line, she sees me -- <u>bingo</u>!  Love is rekindled, and she takes me up to the palace for a little...  tea and crumpets... and you take your place again, and go march around to your heart's content!
You're a real buddy.
Eggs he asks me for. Oranges. What you need is a good horse-whipping.
From me the doctor has no secrets. Poor girl -- how could you do a thing like that?
Well, I have some paper towels --
Sheldrake?
Shall we say -- a dollar?
I should have stayed in bed last night.
Yeah.
Just tell 'em -- now and then.
Well -- I could meet you at the theatre -- if that's all right.
How is your cold?
How come?
Thank you.  I thought you were avoiding me.
You shouldn't.
Don't be too sure. Just because I wear a uniform -- that doesn't make me a Girl Scout.
Why not?  They seem friendly enough.
Nothing.  There are just too many people here.
No -- I like it.
Much better.
This is a bad day for me.
Why?
I think so.
After all, this is a conservative firm -- I don't want people to think I'm an entertainer --
The mirror -- it's broken.
Oh.  Yes?  Just a minute.  If you don't mind -- this is sort of personal
You don't want me here --
No -- I don't want anything.
Well, I haven't figured it out, exactly.
I'll tell her I spent the night with a friend.
He doesn't give a damn about me.
You don't have to entertain me.
A bad insurance risk?
Gin.
Pick up your cards and let's go.
Oh.
I guess so.
A what?
I wonder how long it takes to get someone you're stuck on out of your system? If they'd only invent some kind of a pump for that --
That's terrible.
Might as well go all the way.
Nothing's changed. You know, we never finished that gin game --
For that matter, you were wrong about me, too. What you said about those who take and those who get took? Well, Mr. Sheldrake wasn't using me -- I was using him. See?  Last month I was at desk 861 on the nineteenth floor -- now I'm on the twenty-seventh floor, paneled office, three windows -- so it all worked out fine -- we're both getting what we want.
Aren't you meeting Mr. Sheldrake?
That's very wise.
Good night, Miss Kubelik.
I'm fine.
That's funny -- so am I.  What did you do with the cards?
I'm going to send him a fruit cake every Christmas.
Yes, sir.
Mr. Dobisch said that?
What kind of joint are you running?
There's a certain key floating around the office -- from Kirkeby to Vanderhof to Eichelberger to Dobisch -- it's the key to a certain apartment -- and you know who that apartment belongs to?
Just those four -- out of a total of 31,259 -- so actually, we can be very proud of our personnel -- percentage-wise.
Well, I don't want to intrude -- and I thought -- since it's all straightened out anyway --
Yes, sir.
Relax, Baxter.
Oh, no sir. Certainly not. Anyway, it's none of my business -- four apples, five apples -- what's the difference -- percentage-wise?
I mean -- the young lady -- whoever she may be -- it was on the couch when I got home last night.
Sir?
Good. Is there anything you need -- money -- ?
Swell. And don't think I've forgotten what you did for me.  This way, Baxter.
Mine?
Well, it's just that so many things have been happening so fast -- I'm very pleased -- especially for Miss Kubelik. Now that I've gotten to know her better, I think she's the kind of girl that definitely ought to be married to somebody --
I got kicked in the head, too.
The only thing is I'm staying at the Athletic Club -- and it's strictly stag so if you don't mind --
So what's it going to be?
Just following doctor's orders. I've decided to become a mensch. You know what that means? A human being.
I know, Buddy-boy, I know.  But those things don't always run on schedule -- like a Greyhound bus.
What do you want?
Now will you get out?
Well, after all, it's my apartment -- it's private property -- it's not a public playground.
Thank you, Mr. Vanderhof. But I'm sick -- I have this terrible cold -- and a fever -- and I got to go to bed right after work.
Oh.  'Bye, Doc.
Oh, that's not me.  It's just that once in a while, I have some people in for a drink.
Yeah.  Well -- see you, Doc. 
I don't know what you did to that girl in there -- and don't tell me -- but it was bound to happen, the way you carry on. Live now, pay later. Diner's Club!  Why don't you grow up, Baxter? Be a mensch! You know what that means?
Oh, I'm fine, Doc.
Sure, Doc.
Mickey? He wouldn't do nothing like that. He's a jockey. They caught him doping a horse.
It's an emergency -- see you some other time.
Yeah, he's punchy. Talking to himself.
No.
You can't sleep.  Come on, Fran -- open your eyes.  Let's get her walking. We've got to keep her awake for the next couple of hours.
Come on, Fran.
And before me there was Miss Rossi in Auditing -- and after me there was Miss Koch in Disability -- and just before you there was Miss What's-Her-Name, on the twenty- fifth floor --
It's on the way.  I see you went ahead and cut your hair.
Look, Jeff -- we had two wonderful months this summer -- and that was it. Happens all the time -- the wife and kids go away to the country, and the boss has a fling with the secretary or the manicurist -- or the elevator girl. Comes September, the picnic is over -- goodbye. The kids go back to school, the boss goes back to the wife, and the girl --  They don't make these shrimp like they used to.
For a while there, you try kidding yourself that you're going with an unmarried man. Then one day he keeps looking at his watch, and asks you if there's any lipstick showing, then rushes off to catch the seven-fourteen to White Plains. So you fix yourself a cup of instant coffee -- and you sit there by yourself -- and you think -- and it all begins to look so ugly --
Not here, Fran. Can't we go some place else?
They got it an a long playing record now - Music to String Her Along By. My wife doesn't understand me -- We haven't gotten along for years -- You're the best thing that ever happened to me --
Just trust me, baby -- we'll work it out somehow --
I wasn't trying.
And just think -- right now there's some lucky girl in the building who's going to come after me --
Yeah, we better.
I don't know. I guess that's the way it crumbles -- cookie-wise.
I'd spell it out for you -- only I can't spell.
A hundred and seventy-ninth street -- the Bronx.
Like hell you will.  You'll buy me a cab.
Bob WHO? -- all right, so we'll watch it at the apartment. Big deal.  Baxter? It's okay for Thursday.
Go where?
It won't happen again.
See if they'll what?
Yeah.
Esprit de corps --
Get out --
I will -- I assure you that -- You got a fifty on that H-34 -- leave the ammo in boxes -- I'll get my men to bring the first drum with 'em --
I know, I know, it's all right. Come in this way. It's mined over there. This way. It's all right.
Moonby. Got any Winstons?
Moonby, 4th battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, Task Force. Ex-Corporal Moonby, deserted.
Sure, thanks.
Sort of.
No -- I worked too far north for LRRP.
We do.
I hate that -- Every time I hear that noise something terrible happens.
Call me what, sir?
Yeah, it is.
God knows.
Sure.  Recoil... I feel the recoil of my rifle.
... he's an amazing officer.
No -- most of 'em are still standing -- might've been disease.
Chief, try to keep out of where we're going -- Why we're goin' and what's gonna be the big surprise.
We're gonna have some help to get in the river. You know these waters, Chief ?
This whole area is lousy with V.C. -- We don't stand a chance. Lemme turn around and we'll be in Hau Fat in six minutes.
One that went up for murder -- he was an Army Sergeant.
Yeah -- he really dug his Playboy mag, man -- I mean like he was there when it arrived -- He just knew.
He's in the L.B.J. -- didn't give him no medals or nothing --
I wonder if that was the same copter.
If you're B.L. Willard, 4th Recon Group, we'd like you to come with us.
He was the tragedy -- the tragedy of this war.
They must have seen the fire.
A lame ?
Of course. I -- Once we make our repairs, we could send word, we could have you evacuated from here.
Do you know that jungle?
Thank you, sir.
What?
Yeah -- yeah, I can understand how you feel.
It's really long left slide, breaks on the short side of the point -- catches a south swell.
Six to eight feet.
Mercenaries -- agents, traitors -- they put out caches.
Music?
Who?
The kid can't ride sloppy waves.
No -- no, sir.
I'm taking you back. You can still live.
I'm taking you back.
You knew him best.
Yes, I know...
He can't kill us.  We're on his side.
Nah.
A Yater spoon is hard to get -- especially here.
No -- leave it --
We'll be needing some supplies and fuel -- do you know anybody who can give me a hand?
Why did they attack us?
No, Colonel Kurtz couldn't be crazy -- if you heard him talk, just last week, you'd never think he was crazy.
No. Not really.
What did you hear?
Big show in the parade grounds this noon -- some boss stuff --
Stepped on a booby trap, sir -- got blown all to hell --
Beverly Hills --
Straight up the road -- a concrete bunker -- Beverly Hills -- where else you think he'd be?
23   CONTINUED:  
Used to see the natives eating roots when I was a kid in Nome.
139  CONTINUED:
150  CONTINUED:
94   CONTINUED:  
I just want this over with.
Your infrared camera?
I was making my rounds, saw your hangar wide open, plane getting rained on, so I closed it up.
I was gone, in September, laying traplines.  She went to our cache for some meat.  Got mauled by a bear.  Tore open her skull. -more-
Be careful -- there're two of them.
You make it sound like a prison sentence.
Fairbanks is a three-hour flight. I'll be back by dinnertime.
I know.  Least you didn't shoot all of them.
Ecology.  Folks use that term for everything but what it means: who's eating who.
A daughter in Oregon.
Snow shelter.  Okay.  You dig. I'll have a little sit-down.
I've been on ice like this when I was a kid, skating.  Spread your weight, keep moving.  Go on.
We've got another two hours of daylight.
Forget it.  It would take days.
I'm here to do my job.
You're not going to slow us down! Keep moving!
Don't bet on it.
You don't know how true that is.
You broke the radio, remember?
Shut up!
Ben...boys.  Yeah, real slow, and I'd like to keep it that way.
Good idea.  Flying over mountains can give you some nasty surprises.  Go too low, one of the clouds might have a big rock inside it.
What's the problem with Sam Wilder's place?
Have you heard anything from the girl staying with me, Anne Marie?
-- I'm putting him on the plane to Fairbanks, eleven tomorrow.
Corbett ruined my two-way.  Go to my place on the Haul Road, tell Anne Marie I'm okay and to sit tight.
What are you talking about?
I should release Corbett because you want some votes?
Aw, Jesus.  Told you this was trouble.  What about you, big shot?  Do something.  Who's side are you on, anyway?
Goddamn!  Viking Bob!  Mitchell's inside, boring bastard...
Maybe they went back to Devil's Cauldron.
What you gonna do with it?  Large bore's for shit on small game.
Doesn't matter.  We know where they're going.  C'mon.
No, I didn't.  So why are you h...
Emergency room only.
No.
No. I asked. They said it's not covered under my plan. And it's not necessary anyway.
His home number.
Okay.
No.
It's okay -- I'll sit here.
Otherwise, you're not ugly.
What's with the dark?
You all set here?
How ya doing?
I was working...  can't you just drop me a thank-you note?
Yes. I'm going to give my queer neighbor a lift to Baltimore.
Write me a note and ain't she sweet. I need a hand and where'd she go.
Is there another way to see it?
Oh.  We might. Yes. We can. Let's.
Whether crabs are in season there now...
Nonsense!
No.
Dancing?
I've been thinking about that since you brought it up before.
No...  ... I don't get this place. They make me buy an outfit but they let you wear a house dress. I don't get it.
Melvin, pay me a compliment... I need one and quick... You have no idea how much what you said just hurt my feelings.
Never.
To hell with sex.
Yeah... Well...
Okay. Good-bye.
... 'Cause of being woken up, and it would make my job impossible. So then I wouldn't even try.
What a break...
It relaxes me... I'd feel better just sitting on the curb in front of your house than anyplace else I can think of or imagine.
Oh, come on in and try not to ruin everything by being you.
You know what? I...
No... Nervous. It would be very rough, Carol, if you weren't along.
Why? What have you been thinking about?
Thanks. But I just want to take a bath and...
All right, cut me a break.
I'll take care of myself --
No. No. Get Carol.
I can help you if you take the responsibility to keep regular app --
No, I promise...  not a chance. I own this guy. There was no one else. I'm on the move too much. Trust me.
Sure -- take him to the vet.
Concerned. I'm just the hall monitor here.
Wait here.
I haven't looked at myself yet. I figured I could tell from your reaction.
Frank's idea. He thought I should have notes so I did this right... maintained focus, didn't get emotional and tried not to terrify you.
See, he's right. I need the cards.  Simon, you're broke.
Not just today -- Uh, could you do it -- until, until he gets back on his feet?
Well, that's a load off.
Okay, then.
I called. I never touched you. I didn't leave my name or nothing.
Thank you for walking him.
It smells like shit in here?
Get out.
Thanks.
Melvin...
I'm going back with you.
Look, I've got to get a hold of Frank and see where I'm hanging my hat 'cause...
What are you talking about?
They did a nice job... Cozy, huh?
Look, we both want the dog -- and...
No... and you're supposed to be sensitive and sharp.
Absolutely not.
I think of a man and take away reason and accountability.
The fact that you haven't said, "hold it" means I haven't done it right...  is that correct? I haven't done it right?
What restaurant?
So you're from around here?
Get out.  You think I'm running you up?  Get out.
The hell I can't.  It's my cab.  I don't like you.  So, get the hell out!
No fucking way.
I knew the same way in ten years you're going to know.
What?
Do you want Rath or not?
Sure.
Yes, sir.
I'm worried about you, Robert.
Robert?  Robert?
He has to clean up.  How many bodies were there?
What do you mean, 'that's all'? What in the hell do you know?
Another contractor.
Right now, as we sit here, he is tearing through your apartment.  He is digging through your drawers, emptying your closets.  He will take your telephone and address books, your appointment books.  If you keep a diary, he is reading it.  He'll go into the kitchen and find out what kind of food you eat, liquor you drink, cigarettes you smoke.  In the bathroom he will find any prescription drugs you take and where you get them filled.  If you have video tape or recordings he will watch and listen to all of them.
This is crazy.  I can't trust you. You can't trust me.  How can we possibly help each other?
The C.I.A.?
You went from high school to the Agency?
But you knew what they were training you for?
Why not?
They tried to kill you?
Then you went freelance?
Yes.
Did it ever bother you?
Does that mean it didn't bother you?
No.  Something honest.
You said you didn't trust it.
What?
Yes.
You can have the bed.  The chair is fine for me.
I don't know... But I'm sure he's not sleeping.
Okay.  Then what?
We split the money?
No.  I went back to the hotel.  And waited.
No.
Five million dollars will buy a lot of Rolaids.
I hate bishops.  They're useless.  I like knights.
So?
Jesus, if someone had --
Why in the hell would you take that chance?
Did he explain how this happened?
What?
Why?
I'm sure you will.
It can be.
After her, I realized that to survive I had to live without... It's dangerous to let things become complicated.
I called because I just want... I need to talk.
Honesty.
No.  They call me, I don't call them.  If they didn't call I wouldn't exist.
Do you believe that?
Yes.
Just a little ways.  Up to those trees.
I hope not.
I thought that I would be thinking about Margaret, or work, or that I'd be having these deep, profound and depressing thoughts but I'm not.  I'm trying to think really profound thoughts, but I can't. It seems very funny to me.
Go ahead.
I used to think about it.  I had Margaret.  She wanted kids.  I thought about moving somewhere far away like, Europe.  I could see all of that, the first part, the getting away but I couldn't see that next part.  'Then what?' So I'd stop thinking about it and go back to work.  You understand?
It's okay, they're training me on the cash register and after I hope to work on one of the jewellery counters.
An alternative literary venue!
You've got to stop using that word "we" it's getting kind of scary. Right Katka?
Amazing, he didn't even say "if".
Don't worry, I'll give you a hand as soon as I can.
You sure got a handle on that word "we".
Yeah, you're in luck there's two of them, the other's in there.
I thought that was part of the charm!
You're nuts man, Katka's right!
Yeah, I'm beginning to see that.
Sounds like a good reason to leave it alone.
Why, how in the hell are we going to set up a cafe?
I don't know Doug, we haven't even got the place together and already you want to extend it.
We got a party tomorrow night. Can't have the place smelling like shit.
Have you ever stolen anything?
Not yet, we need a few lengths of scaffold.
We don't speak Czech!
Why don't we go together?
Both, see you later.
Forget it Doug, it's no good.
What?
No, the boyfriend.
Didn't I tell you, she dumped me Monday night.
Holly!
Yeah and I got the bruises to prove it. So what?
That bad?
Did you see a lawyer and go before a judge?
WE gotta think of something.
Did you see anything in the files?
No point, it'll be in Czech and God knows what format. But if I'm right, they could be my ticket out of here.
Look, I don't care whether you go with Doug or not, but you_ve got to see him before he leaves.
What are you talking about?
No, by road?
Doug?
No!
Doug, haven't seen you for a while.
Sure. Excellent.
Yeah, maybe.
You used to read.
I'll get the drinks, but not here. Let's split. I can't stand this any more, it's murdering my respect for literature.
What? You are crazy!
Look Kat it'll only take ten minutes. Without Jahn I might never find it... We'll just have a quick look and then you and I'll hit a tram.
Don't worry it's okay!
Okay, whatever. Come on Chris!
So, we won't be going to London?
No.
Then tell me, what will happen? Tell me!
I'm no good for you Katka, besides I won't be able to stay in Prague.
It's perfect, you've done a great job.
Ah, so what?
A month, Jesus! And how do I know you're not crapping me?
Deal!
I don't know - maybe they are talking about it now. Mr Vitovetch is a good friend of the Judge.
Am I invited?
We don't need you.
I know, some are trapped, usually by money.
Yeah seems okay.
Alright!
Oh shit, yeah. Can you lend some more money?
That's right.
Fuck you!
A kind of freedom.
No!
You may use my office.
Yeah!
A drill, what are you up to?
Just yesterday.
Oh that's it? Everything I do is crap!
Don't you dare, I'll be back!
Josh, I have to speak you, it's urgent.
The files are in a sealed room and the University are under strict orders to stay away.
The building has been occupied and the locks have been changed.
Because she doesn't know what a hint is.
I'm sorry about how we --
And I have no idea why.
Cuz nothing happened at school.
I don't want his money.
Thanks.
No. I won't be long.
I meant he's a doctor.
I could do it if I tried. Even Kelly thinks so.
Mom, great. But what I want is for me to be proud of me.
You do --
No. Thanks. Gotta keep my wits for the drive home.
-- This your idea of small talk?
Your book and your brown sweater and your hair. What's more to know -- ?
'They won't.'
Why?
Kinda. Yeah.
And you have to meet my father.
Don't you?
Interpreted by another guy like my father.
You don't know what you want --
It means you can do anything.
What?
Where?
Twice a year.
Before the divorce. My father used to take me here. Fire spotting was his summer job.
What would you do up here?
Me.
I don't care.
Yes, one of many.
I'm not applying to college.
That's what I mean.
Better. I was really angry.
Because you have hope that you'll get better?
It's not that simple.  It costs money to do this at home.
Let's get something straight. You don't know me. I don't know you. But I know what you're about.  Keep your distance from this house -- and from Jamie.
Does it have to do with Jamie?
That won't be possible.
I don't want to see her hurt.
Your parents are divorced?
Please.
I'm as underprivileged as they are --
When do I get time for me?
You came here to give me my report card?
I beg your pardon?
Uh, yes, sir...
Dick, what's with those guys out there in the gutter? 
I was practicing. I've got an audition next week -- I gotta practice. How am I gonna get famous if I don't practice?
Fine.
Seventeen.
Oh, I'm feeling much better now.
Nine o' clock.  Oh, I'm late! Maybe I'll see you later.
Learn anything?
Say what you were supposed to say in the cafeteria.
In the parking lot, with her.
George it's not your concern. Don't worry about it. Just remember that at 9:00, you'll be strolling through the parking lot and you'll see us -- struggling in the car, you'll run over, open the door and say....?
Oh. Uh... 'Hey, you! Get your damn hands off her!'  George paused. You really think I should swear?
No, George, just concentrate on the anger. Anger.
All I can say is, that's one helluva attitude, Mr. McFly. 'Let's explode a hundred megaton Geothermal nuclear device, just to see it.'
Unfortunately, the way things are going, you may get your wish. You may see the entire annhiliation of the world. If not, you'll certainly see the destruction of all out natural resources. We can already see the air we breathe, not to mention the pollution in our rivers and lakes. We'll  see all of our oil reserves depleted, in fact, all of our energy sources. Yes, you people have a lot to look forward to -- a lot to see.
Marty. Marty Lewis.
Five cents, please.
Oh, right, right... 
Get behind the shield! I'm about to release radiation!
Sure! Listen -- we take the racing results from today's paper...
So what? We'd be rich!
You didn't, Professor. It was an accident! You see, what happened --
Oh. That expression probably hasn't been invented yet... I can get behind -- I agree with you.
We don't....
That's just great!
Believe me, Professor, running around on a nuclear test site can't be any more dangerous than what I've been doing.
But that's impossible!! George asked her out! He had to! I saw him walk her home! Oh, God!
Are you trying to tell me that my mother's got the hots for me?
Professor Brown grinned. I guess I'll see you in... about 30 years.
87 states? Time travel bans? What the hell?
According to your girlfriend, Suzy Parker, you and she were at the movies. You went to the restroom and you never came out. Obviously, you stepped through an inter-dimensional time warp, created by the original operation of the time machine.
Dick? Dick who?
No self confidence, I guess... At least you don't take after him.
Well, he's gone.
Okay.
Yeah.
Running this place for a fella in town. Nothing much to speak of.
Long as my ammo held out... Right there's where you caught me.
You better not leave that Cadillac sitting out here.
They're okay.
Tom...
Is that right?
Well, it's not good enough.  Just what do you think would happen to her if she stuck around with you, Kit? Guy like you.
Yeah? Why not?
What's your friend's name?
What?
Great.
Yeah, the tree makes it nice.
But it would hurt.
You said that once already... Too late now.
They're not going to listen to me. You either. Are you kidding?
He was nervous.
He didn't say anything to me about it.
Just looking.
Excuse me.
I just don't want to go.
Hi... ah, Mister Scarborough here?
Just thinking.
Yes.
Name is Carruthers. Believe I shoot people every now and then. Not that I deserve a medal.
Beats me.
Wanta sue me?
Then that's it!
Nothing to apologize for, Casper.  You've gone beyond the call of duty tonight.  Mind if I get on the horn and radio the Cavaliers--?  They'll be worried.
Rawhide, go find out how Professor Hikita's coming with that formula. Mrs. Johnson, take Casper and Scooter, gas up the Jet Car.
Careful...don't make noise and don't touch me.  I'm hotter than flapjacks.
There's a Harley behind those bushes.  Get back to the laboratory and start working on the formula.  We don't have time to ask questions. Just synthesize it-
Got a half a tuna sandwich.
I think I'm on to something. You and the guys go back to the house and dig up everything you can on an outfit called Yoyodyne.
Not really.  This is pretty important.
They will never surrender.  They will fight to the end.
What? How do you know that?
Stole his body?  When Doctor Lizardo's hair turned red and his mind snapped?  Of course!  What else?
Penny.  I'd rather not reveal my last name or my age.
Who were you really trying to kill last night?
Who?
Which?  The one in my throat.
I'll shoot yours off if I had a gun, you double-dealing Casanova!  I thought you liked me for myself.  But why should you, huh?  A jerk like me.
She was murdered by Hanoi Shan on our wedding night.
Go where?  Where're you going?
It's too dangerous.
A what?
I have a radio fix...
Still no confirmation either from SAC or Strategic Space Command.  They report all surveillance satellite communication jammed.
Nigh on ten years.  Been through a lotta scrapes together.
Government work.  Had my own think tank.  Got tired of thinking-wanted some action.  Seen plenty of it too.  So will you if you stick around.
Doesn't look anything like her to me.
Asshole probably got lost.
Whadda you need Buckaroo for?
Flying to Cambodia.
Please, Barton.
Really?...
That doesn't help anything, Bill.
Drown all those rascals...
Hesh up! Be still now! DROWN 'EM! DROWN 'EM! DROWN -
Garland, it's me.
What DID you mean?
All of us undomesticated writers eventually make their way out here to the Great Salt Lick. Mebbe that's why I allus have such a powerful thrust.
But Lipnik said he wanted to look at the script, see something by the end of the week.
He's a great writer -
Yeah, I'm fine, Garland - I have to talk to you. I'm calling long distance.
Have you read the Bible, Garland?
I can feel my butt getting sore already.
Yeah, come in Charlie. Hadn't really gotten started yet - what happened to your ear?
Seen a doctor?
Okay, but hell, you should know what it is. I can show you in about thirty seconds.
Well it's... it's a defense mechanism.
Thanks, brother. But the fact is, I gotta pull up stakes temporarily.
I guess the heat's sweating off the wallpaper.
Yeah.
I don't know!  Maybe it was her... boyfriend. I passed out. I don't know.  Won't the police be able to -
Everything's okay, believe me. I know it's rough mentally, but everything's taken care of.
Because you DON'T LISTEN!
I apologize, Barton.
Ah, forget it, kid. I want you to pull this out of your head. If that sonofabitch wouldn't apologize to you, goddammit, I will. I respect your artistry and your methods, and if you can't fill us in yet, well hell, we should be kissing your feet for your fine efforts.
Must be.
All of which he's now missin'.
Female caucasian, thirty years old. Nice tits. No head. You ever see Mundt with anyone meets that description?
...Fred...
How's about it, Bart?
Excellent picture.
Do you have any evidence that he showed your psychiatric file to anyone?
When did you start drinking again?
Going after him before gets you off the hook for killing him that's your alibi.
Who are you guys gonna sell my file to this time?
It's been three months.
No.
Baby-sitting.  Rookie cop.
I thought you quit.
No.  I mean it, thank you.
She knows stuff about me that only you know.
What was she like in school?
Tell me about Catherine.
She didn't hand you to me.  She doesn't even know who you are. She told me about Lisa Henderson.
No.  We had a drink at the club. We left together.  I came here. He went home.
No.  I wasn't in the mood to have sex with anyone last night.
I quit.
I loved him.  I hurt.
No.
Why not?
I'd like to ask you some, too.
Didn't you study it in school?
I wasn't talking about real friends. Why doesn't Gus like me.
You can make a mistake.
No.  I wrote it years afterwards.
Do you want personal insights and adolescent secrets?  I don't do those.
Did you like her to watch?
I found Lisa Henderson.
Really.  What are you writing about.
It won't sell.
Somebody has to die.
Exactly what do you have in mind, Mr. Corrigan.
Why would I need an attorney?
Yes I am.
Do you use drugs, Ms. Tramell?
Routine.
Do you remember his name?
Nilsen?
Nothin'  I'll be okay, pop.
I don't son, but I got the minority opinion.
I know what that's like.
I feel fine!
That's her pussy talkin' --He gets a real nasty look from a very fat woman eating a cheeseburger.  He winks at her.  The woman looks away from him, shaking her head.
Maybe it wasn't her that paid him. Maybe the money was for somethin' else.  How the fuck do I know? I'm just an old city cowboy tryin' not to fall outta his saddle.
You're my friend, Gus.
Don't you get it, Gus?  If Beth killed Johnny Boz to frame Catherine -- she wouldn't want anyone to know what happened at Berkeley.  It gives her the motive to kill Nilsen.
Sometimes I think he started banging her just to get himself off the hook with Internal Affairs.
Formerly engaged to Roberto Vasquez, deceased --
She didn't ask me for the ride. She asked anybody.
How the fuck do you know?  What is it with you and this broad anyway?
How you're saying she killed her parents?  Did she kill Bobby Vasquez, too?
Fuck you, too Nick.
Catherine Tramell.  It's part of her game.
Maybe that's what you're counting on to get you off the hook.
Fourteen.  We seal juvenile records until they're deceased.  That's why you didn't find it in your computer.
He was shot.
I haven't felt like talking to him since that thing came out.
Saddle River's in New Jersey.
That's good. At least they're interested.
Wow... Stop giving them away.  I got an invitation to model for Comme de Garcons... You wanna do it with me?
Do you still love her?
We can do better. It needed more white.
When I was poor, everybody doubted I could make it. When I got rich, everyone said, `yeah, but he'll never keep it up.' Now everyone says `he's killing himself.' So I clean up, and then they say `Look. His art's dead.' I don't take drugs, anyway. I'm healthy now.
You want a drink?
I didn't see you.
Bring him over sometime. I have some other stuff to show him.
I'm here.
They're just words.
We don't hang them at home, y'know - just in the streets..
Willie Mays.
Oh - you mean black people!
Come on in!
Yeah... I'll paint on it.
I hadn't thought about it.
You mean babies with you?
What's that about?
I don't believe it, Jean - they're picking straws.
What's his name?
Yeah, it's the best one.
Thanks
Fuck...  I forgot about that.
Thanks... I'll take it tonight.
I just don't think you're being fair.
I need this?
Yo... You know why Rammellzee's here, don't you?
It's vichyssoise, sir.
You'll never guess.
I'm -- sorry, I --
Don't be naive.  The law doesn't apply to people like him!  Or us --
I, ah ... didn't catch your last name.
No darker than yours, Bruce.
Yeah?  Me too...
Somewhat like the lonesome secretary syndrome, I'd suppose.
If I said yes, then you might think me a Norman Bates, or a Ted Bundy type ... and then you might not let me kiss you.
Ah ... then you've come to the right lonely mansion.
Good time, too.  Everyone but the bandits seem to be slacking off till after New Years'.
I'm not scared of you, Max.
Scared of Oswald, are you?  Why, if his parents hadn't eighty- sixed him you two might've been roomies, at prep school!
A half-pint.  I'm talking gallons.
Batman.  The thorn in both our sides, the fly in our ointment.
I have but one pet cause, today: Ban The Bat.
You're quick.  Mayor Cobblepot.
I wouldn't touch you to scratch you.
PMS.
The Christmas Eve of Destruction -- !
My god ... it's true.  The Penguin- Man of the sewers ... Please, don't h--
No, just give you a splitting headache.
Fred.  Fred?  He's ... actually he's been on an extended vacation, and --
You won't regret this, Mr. Shreck.
Yes, adulation is a cross to bear. God knows <u>I</u> know.  But someone's got to supplant our standing-in- the-way-of-progress Mayor and don't deny it, Mr. Cobblepot, you've got the magic!
Sidetracked?  Oswald, this is your chance to fulfill a destiny that your parents carelessly discarded ...
Imagine:  You'll have the ear of the media.  Access to captains of industry.  Unlimited poon- tang ...
Point is, listen to them.  They've lost faith in old symbols. They're ready to bond with you, the icon of the future.  If it works, don't fix it...
No, I am.  Yes, I'm boning up for your Bruce Wayne meeting in the morning.  I pulled all the files on the proposed power plant, and Mr. Wayne's hoped-for investment... I've studied up on all of it ... I even opened the protected files and --
I'm no cat.  I'm just an assistant. A <u>secretary</u> --
That's my name, Maximillions. Don't wear it out, babe, or I'll make you buy me a new one.
I damn well better be.  In fact I want you to phone those goniffs over at Gotham Insurance and tell them --
Too late for what, dear child?
In spirit only, I'm afraid.
No, my boy.  I'm afraid none of us can.
Everyone dies, Master Bruce.  There's no defeat in that.  Victory comes in fighting for what we know is right while we still live.
Right here, sir.
Oxbridge Academy?
Keep it.
Hey, what's your problem?
What are you talking about?
Alfred's happy here.
Crimefighter's rule number one: never say that.
What are you talking about?
Kill her later.  We've got work to do.
Maybe he melted.
People come first, Dr. Isley.
I can't.  But perhaps tonight, over dinner...I've just had an opening.
What?  I'm sorry.  You were saying...
Her name is Pamela Isley.  I saw her talking to Gordon.  She must have stolen his keys, altered the signal-
She's infected us with some kind of pheromone extract-
You once said to me that being part of a team means trusting your partner.  That sometimes counting on someone else is the only way to win.  DO you remember?
I knew you could handle it.
Fine.  While I retrieve my diamonds, you and meatloaf will bring my wife to your lair.  She's frozen in -
Where is my wife?
You lie!
Adam and Evil.
Can't we just ice them along with the rest of the citizenry?
I'm hungry.  I think I'll have poultry.
To be frozen.  To never change.  A life of perpetual ice-olation. There is little perfection in that.
At you?  Polly want a kiss?
Of trust. Tell me your plan.
Then you never loved me?
Our work?
I believe you said the same thing about the Batmobile.
She has an excellent mind.
I shall be near at hand. Should you need me. And sir, I know it's difficult but try and have a good time.
Perhaps. Perhaps not. Why not ask the lady?
Not that young. It's been a long time since you've called me that.
Perhaps the fall...
What?
Of course. 13 is M....MRE.
Enigma.
Claw Island. Nygma's headquarters. I'm sure that's where they're keeping Chase.  Are all the Batsuits destroyed?
How ya doin', Al?
How come this is the only locked door around this museum? What's back there?
And you are?
It's the car, right? Chicks love the car.
You like strong women. I've done my homework. Or do I need skin-tight vinyl and a whip?
Did Two-Face call him Bruce?
No more tricks, Edward. Release Chase and Dick. This is between you and me.
Nygma. Edward Nygma. You hired me. Personally. Just like I tell everyone.  Well, we've never actually met, but your name was on the hire slip.
Slanta.
Wacko? That a technical term?
So what you're saying, this guy's a total wacko, right?
What?
Sorry. I haven't even had time to unpack. Instant coffee okay?
Spare me the diagnosis, okay? You're being ridiculous. I can't be jealous of Batman.  Can I?
I got no place at the circus without my family. I'm going to get a fix on Two-Face. Then I'm going to kill him.
Bruce, you can't.
Fred?
A man with a death wish.
So not everyone can be a poet. Still, I respect the sentiment.
Addictive isn't it? Just Say No. Until I say yes. A little fringe benefit of working with me. Now here's the concept, counselor. Crime. My I.Q., your AK-47. You help me gather production capital so I can produce enough of these  to create an empire that will eclipse Bruce Wayne's forever. And, in return I will help you solve the greatest riddle of all. Who is Batman?
You're a genius.
A miss. And my favorite vitamin, I might add.
I'd say about thirty feet, sir.
Which bathroom is that, sir?
Respectfully, sir... there'll never be another one like you.
Don't ever say that, sir. Don't ever believe it.
Take me. Let the boy go.
What are you talking about?
WHICH CAR?
I know. I called them.
... Where are you taking me?
Quite a while. I took the scenic route.
I might consider it if you introduce me to Miss Vale.
Too much work.  I'm not really the physical type -- Thank you, Alfred.
In other words, what right do I have to talk about terror.
Sometimes... I don't know if there's enough of me left to save.
Very thoughtful. Don't touch it.
I feel naked without it.
Finding out where she is.
I've had an automatic tracer on this number ever since he tracked you to the museum.
Vicki. Do you love half of me? Or all of me?
I suggest a nice big bomb.
Why, Eckhardt.  You should be thinking about the future.
What are you, scared of heights?
Look, Johnny Gobs got ripped and walked off a roof, all right?  No big loss.
No shit.  It was all over the pavement.
God!  How old are you?  There ain't no bat.
Very good idea, Jack.  In fact --  -- I'd like you to handle this operation personally.
Miss Vale, was it something I said?  Do you want to sniff my flower?
Evildoers, huh?  Big or small?
All aver the world.  They say he's spent half of his life overseas.
Likes to kill? KNOX  Women find him magnetic.
Why?  Aw, come on, Vicki, I'm a reporter. I'm curious.  I do this for a living.  There's a phone.  You can call him up and cancel.
Oh, Bruce...
... Oh?  Why is that, Vicki?
Right.  And they know him.  And that's why it would never occur to them for a minute that their old buddy Bruce puts on a cape at night and goes out looking for --
Great. How??
Sounds great.  Excellent.  Though-, Ahm... there's this guy who's coming to work at the Gallery, from England...
Yes.  Yes.  Sometime.
That's exactly what I said ... before I said - Great, it's a sensational idea."
Your face smells like a foot.
Great.  You said you'd ask Grierson about putting our guest somewhere else.  Did you?
Meaning?
Great.  Classic timing.  Why don't you ask her just to leave a date for the divorce?  I'll check my diary later.
Ahm.....
But the particular glory of the system... is that it can also work oh large screens in each individual room - so we can network the program to every room in the gallery.
Isn't it?
Thanks, David.  Always a pleasure.
Yes.  Ahm.  I was just wondering where my English house guest had got to.
Great news.
Hey.  Let's junk the medals, Elmer.  This is not a Veterans' reunion. We wanna make the Governor feel at home.  Not remind him of piles of dead people wearing uniforms.
Thank you Bernie.  Well done.  Now, If you'll excuse - I have a little smartening up to do myself.
Thank you, sir.  Although, I'm afraid I don't quite see how we can ...
I'm er ... sorry if you've been waiting a long time.
Time taken its toll on the old girl, eh?
VERY ACCOMMODATING Well, no, sir, I'm sure ...
A car sounds sensible.
Not my place, sir.  It would only be a matter of time before I'm calling you Dave.  Then where would we be?  By next year, you're my Sweety-Pie" and I'm "Coochie-Coo".  I'11 be back in 15.
I am sorry you feel that way.
Yeah, heh heh.
Entert-ain...us...an-us...Oh yeah! Heh heh. Anus. Heh heh.
Yeah, heh heh. He's a anus. Heh heh.
Yeah, heh heh. I thought there'd be casinos and lights and stuff.
And Boot-Head.
Yeah, we should party.
Heh heh. Yeah.
Uh... Uh...
Me first! Me first!
Me first!
Yeah, heh heh, enough'a this crap.
That sucks. Heh heh. They need some shows about fire! Change the channel.
Uh, probably like, another five minutes or something.
Dammit!!!! Dammit!!!!
Uh...
C'mon, Beavis, just start running really fast when you hit the ground. It'll work.
Yeah. We can go see Hole and then we can get some hole. Huh huh huh huh.
Could you, like, tell her we're ready to score?
Oh yeah,...I mean no. NO! I won't settle down! Not this time!...
What's your problem Beavis?
Uh, I probably will, but not you. You're too much of a butt-monkey. Huh huh.
Washington! That's where she was gonna meet up with ya?  Damn, she's goin' all the way!
Oh, maybe you're lactose intolerant.
OK boys. Get ready to fire on the count of three.  I'm gonna give you three seconds...
D.C., Chief.
Agent Hurley...
Attention all units. We've got him. He's in front of a camper in the visitor's lot.
That's why I'm bussing it across America. I'm so glad you're here.  Jim, I want you to meet two nice boys.
Uh, ten uh...
So do I, Jane.  I'm on vacation.
Don't forget the balls, Ernie.
How's your arm?
Oh, Adam.  We're home.  In our own house.  Nonsense.  I'll make some coffee.  You get some more firewood.
Yes it did.  Yes it did.  I made a couple of small discoveries. Here's one.
Dishes?  We haven't eaten in three weeks!  Adam, I'm not like you, I really need to be around <u>people</u>, get out to the church and go grocery shopping.
I don't know if there's anything we can do.
Nothing.  The bio buster?  I don't get it...
We're not going to wait here like cornered animals.  I can tell you that.  We need help.  I'm going to talk to that little girl.
We don't know who he is...  ... I'm going to talk to that little girl.
I don't know... what are you looking up?
Three times.  Powerful number.
Oh, Adam.  I don't have gloves.  My nails keep getting longer.  I'll break them.
Maybe we should knock first?
... acts like she's thirty-five.
Let's see if she can get my model back.
What makes you think she likes me?
<u>Night of the Living Dead</u>?  It's this gross movie.
I'm wearing contacts... Also I read through <u>Handbook for the</u> <u>Recently Deceased</u>.  It says that live people ignore the strange and unusual... not me... <u>I am</u> strange and unusual.
I certainly did.  I'd finish it too, but... I don't get out much.
We want to frighten you away.  So that you'll move out.
I got it.  And I took pictures of the new church for you, too.
W... We didn't know how to make one.
Hi ho, hi ho, it's off to work I go!
We have to start simpler, is that it?
Hey <u>you've</u> been on Saturn!  I <u>hate</u> those sandworms!  <u>Yecchhh</u>! I've lost a lot of buddies to sandworms.  So a daughter?  She got good legs? God I love a young leg.
Home.  <u>Home</u>.  <u>Home</u>!
Hey, I've been in a frigging bottle for six hundred years.  I was out.  Every dog has his day. This is my town.  I need a night to howl.
I always tell the truth.  Of course I can see you.
Funeral.  God, you guys <u>really are</u> <u>dead</u>!  What was it like?  The funeral. Did you cry?
No you don't!  No... Lydia... Why?
That's right, Jane.  Complete vacation.
Jane, don't send photographs of our house around the country! We're not interested in selling.
Where'd they go?
Well, it can't be any worse than my life here.
Yes.
It's spelled different, but basically... Now you said it twice; just one more time, and I'll be free.  And then <u>you'll</u> be free.
You've <u>got</u> to say it!
How'd you like to be married to... the King...?
Let's hope he knows how to produce those damn ghosts for Max and Sarah... Because I've bought options on property all over town.  I need Max's financing...
Stepmother.
... sheets.
Lydia, I don't know what it is with you and these pratical jokes, but --
I cannot believe this.
Yeah yeah, we'll think on it. 'Bye ya, Charles.  You relax up there, ya hear?
I saw some ghosts.
I thought I saw something.
<u>I know</u>!  We just have to <u>pray</u> that the other closets are bigger than this one.
That's Charles' study.  But you don't have to even look in there. He'll love whatever you do to it.  He's such a sheep.
Probably the world's largest <u>Reader's</u> <u>Digest</u> collection!  C'mon, let's have some chablis, Otho, I'm laid bare by this experience.  Entirely bare.
Hold your breath and we'll pull.
The attic.
I understand. I've seen it done before.
Oh, fine.
... Straight out?
Claim...? ... Oh, claim, that's what Thomas asked me.
In a day or two, yes.
That is so true. You're different, Chauncey... Quite different than most men.
We have common foes, Chauncey - kid lawyers and our physician!
It's not good, Ben - I'm sure you can feel it.
He's very intense, and internal, don't you think?
Good. It might be pleasant for a couple of days.  ... Robert... Is there any improvement...?
You really care for him, don't you, Eve?
I think we'd better go look for him.  David!
I see.  Mr. Franklin, I must ask you and Miss Hayes to keep this incident with Mr. Gardiner to yourselves. There's no telling what he was involved in, and the matter may be extremely confidential. So please, not a word.
Fine. Thank you, Mr. Franklin.
Yes. I would like to be on that show.
It's feeling better, but it's still very sore.
Hello, Eve.
I like to watch. This is fine.
Yes.
Thank you, Eve - I like this house very much.
Yes. Are you going to leave and close the house when he dies?
Yes. I was.
How is Ben feeling?
Yes, Eve. I know that.
No. I was with a man. We went upstairs.
I like to watch.
Yes. I like to watch.
Hello, Sid.
No. I'm not busy.
I think you should ask Mr. Rand that.
I don't want Robert.
Your foot! Give me your foot!!
I certainly do.
Yes, it is.  Would you tell me your name again, please?
Sure you do. This ward is air tight, I have a little extra oxygen pumped in, keeps my spirits up.
But I don't have that any more...  ... All that's left for me now is the room upstairs.
You're looking much better today, Ben.
I understand.
A flower...
Yes. I like to watch very much.
Yes. I like to watch.
Yes.
It is quite amazing how those clothes have come back into style.
Of course. I would like to look.
... Yes sir - elevator!
Yes. It is.
Which view?
... The gardener?  ... Yes, of course... Mr. Chance, this is Ms. Hayes.
Yes. I'm waiting for my lunch.
Yes and the Old Man used to come to my garden. He would read and rest there.
I'm fine, Thomas. The garden is a healthy one. There is no need for a claim.
Very well, Mr. Chance - if you insist on dragging this matter on... But I must inform you this house will be closed tomorrow at noon. If indeed, you do reside here, you will have to move out.
Yes, I will.
Wonderful, we'll all look forward to seeing you.  Is Eve around? I'd like to say hello.
Try again.
Thank you, Wilson. That will be fine.
Hello, Sophie.
Would you two excuse me for a moment?
Of course... I'm so sorry for you, Eve...
Gladly...  ... The safe is in Mr. Jennings' bedroom, that'll be stop number one.
We have nothing on him, Ambassador Skrapinov.
Apparently the White House shares our curiosity - they have also launched an investigation, and, according to our sources, neither the F.B.I. nor the C.I.A. has met with success.
Gardiner, yes, sir.
We... uh, have been unable to come up with any information before the man appeared at Mr. Rand's home ... and, uh...
Well, we do have data from Honeycutt's sources, Chief - but it isn't pertinent.
Well, sir - it occurred to us that he might be an agent of a foreign power. But, we ruled that out, as they invariably are provided with too much documentation, too much American identity... We, uh...don't quite know what to make of it yet, sir... But we'll keep on top of it, Mr. President - we'll come up with the answer.
Overall - pretty good. But, Mr. President, I think it's very dangerous to resort to temporary measures at this stage of the game.
I sympathize with your position, Mr. President, I know how difficult it is to be straightforward, the reaction to such a speech could be chaos.
I'm sorry, too. Well, Nancy wanted me to send along her best to the two of you - and, Ben, I want to thank you for your time and thoughts.
Mr. Gardiner...
Okay.
Oh yeah, he's good.
May 11th.
Adorable. What time are they supposed to be here?
I'm sorry. How was your evening?
The ferret?
Right.
I've been going over and over my experience last night. It was amazing.  I've decided I'm a transsexual. Isn't that the craziest thing?
Don't crowd me, Craig.
I'm moving. Remember? What's with the hooded cloak?
What?
Yes.
Life is confusing, isn't it?
I feel that somehow my parents never prepared me to make this particular decision. Not that I blame them. How could they know? Today's world is so complicated.  No. I have to go away now. I'm sorry, Lotte. I'm so sorry.
Yeah, well welcome to the nineties.
Shut up!
What's that?
Things change. Anyway, you gave up your claim to that love the first time you stuck your dick in Maxine.
Perhaps you're right. I can't let you go though. Too much has happened. You're my ace in the hole.
You came up here looking for the portal?
You'll have me, after all I've done to you?
Let me try.
Let me try!
No, uh, my name is Craig Schwartz. I have an interview with Mr. Lester.
Forget it.
I see. Are you unhappy at our little company?
The vacant office. I see. Olive oil. Interesting. Be warned, Schwartz, there are certain ?doors? which should never be opened.
You're insane.
Great.  Buuuhhppaahhhhnnn. . . . . Muhhhahhhhh. . . . . ahhhnnnaaa. . nollltuuukkkaaaaralllll. . . tashabararassssssuuuuusaaaaaaa. . . nnnnnnnaaaaaannnnnnnnncccccceeeeeee Mwaaaaaa. . . . .Mahhhhhkkkkk. . . sssseeeeeen. Maxine?
That's incredible! Nobody told me! I swear! It's kismet. Maxine! It's a beautiful name. There's a psychic connection. Don't you see? It was meant to be! Maxine! Maxine! Maxine! I will shout it from the rooftops!
Just.
You're a fag or a liar.
I mean, I am really attracted to you. Jesus, you are a fag. We can share recipes, if you like, Darlene.
No.
Good. We'll sell tickets.
Exactly. Two hundred dollars a pop.
I'll protect you, Dollface.
How the hell would I know? I wasn't a philosophy major.
Well, Don, I peeked in here, even though I know it's against floor policy. and I discovered that there's a little tiny door in here. Isn't it cute? It's almost like a little dolly's door. I wonder what it's for.
Yes. I'm the only one. I have to enter Malkovich and destroy him from the inside. If not me, who?
Can I be anyone I want?
Yes. Yes. A thousand times, yes!
I like that.
No, for God's sake, I just watered it yesterday.  It almost went well. I gave a pretty good dream, but circumstances arose.
Maxine says she'll leave him if he leaves Malkovich, plus he's been challenged to a puppet-duel by Mantini.
But I think I have another plan.
Why are you being like this?
I am the Devil, Lester. I think I can handle it.
The truth is for suckers, Johnny-Boy.
After that I'll introduce you to my favorite monkey, Elijah. He's got an ulcer, due to a suppressed childhood trauma. But we're getting to the bottom of it.  Psychotherapy.
Because if you missed any, I just happen to have copies here you can take with you when you leave now.
Mr. Malkovich?
Whatever you're having.
Oh, I'm really glad you called.
Oh sure. It's very rewarding...
Do you mind?
Yes, Maxine, yes.
I'll say you are. Let's do it on his kitchen table, then make him eat an omelette off of it.
Wait a minute! What if everybody knew? What if we presented Malkovich as the world's most complicated puppet and me as the only puppeteer sophisticated enough to work him? We'd wipe the floor with the Great Mantini!
Vegas. Can you arrange that?
I'm nervous. Malkovich is fighting me hard today.
Busy day, my little fire chief. Why don't you climb into bed, and I'll meet you there in just...
There was a boy there...said mama was a jailbird...said he could prove it..
Yonder. Twin chestnuts in the yard.
Blue. That doesn't hurt nobody. Yellow neither.
Was a time I knew what was.
You remember Halle.
The boys wouldn't have left if Halle were here.
WHERE ARE THE MEN WITHOUT SKIN?
Don't say those things. You forget about those dreams..
No. Since mama lost her job, we don't have no more pies..
No. Got me an afternoon job at the shirt factory. Figure between that and my night work at the Bodwins I might be able to put something away for me and mama.
May I come in?
I'm looking for work. I was thinking they might know of some.
Yes ma'am.
Ya think?
Work? Start learnin your letters again?
Oh baby...I don't know anyone could pay anybody anything for work they did themselves...But if you all need to eat until your mother's well, all you have to do is say so...We have a church committee invented so nobody had to go hungry.
That was fun.
I'll make sure she does. But first I'm going  make up a nice, big breakfast against that cold outside.
Morning, ma'am.
Hold back Denver - I'm fine..You..you go on upstairs. I'll do the cleaning up.
Mama...Mama she's asleep. Why don't you eat something.
Better ask Paul D.
Her who?
Just me.
You ain't scared of Sethe. I don't believe you.
Who is she? Where she come from?
Make it the way I always do.
Yes sir.
It's the LeBaron.
Why me, man?
Oh, nothin', you know.
No, man, nothing is fucked here--
Crazy, huh?  Ran away a year ago.
Sir, this is a mortuary, not a rental house.
Yeah, but we're--
Yeah Dude, why is Walter so pissed off?
Shut the fuck up, Donny.
Saturday!  Well they'll have to reschedule.
I'm shomer shabbas.
Oh for Christ--will you shut the fuck up, Donny.
Well--
You gotta buck up, man, you can't go into the tournament with this negative attitude--
Shut the fuck up, Donny.  This kid is in the ninth grade, Dude, and his father is--are you ready for this?-- Arthur Digby Sellers.
Shut the fuck up, Donny.  Not a bunch of fig-eaters with towels on their heads tryin' to find reverse on a Soviet tank.  This is not a worthy--
Fuckin' A, man.  I got a rash. Fuckin' A, man.  I gotta tell ya Tony.
Lebowski on the right?
Jeez.  Think he's got room for one more?
--smoking thai-stick, breaking into the ROTC--
And the, uh, the briefcase?
Yeah.  Thanks man.
Uh-huh.  Well, I still jerk off manually.
I FUCKEEN KILL JOR FUCKEEN CAR!
Relax, man!  No physical harm intended!
Irish m--What the fuck are you talking about?  My name's Da Fino!  I'm a private snoop!  Like you, man!
In a sense, yes.  Elfranco, my robe. My art has been commended as being strongly vaginal.  Which bothers some men.  The word itself makes some men uncomfortable.  Vagina.
He fixes the cable?
I'm getting to your rug. My  father and I don't get along; he doesn't approve of my lifestyle and, needless to say, I don't approve of his. Still, I hardly wish to make my father's embezzlement a police matter, so I'm proposing that you try to recover the money from the people you delivered it to.
--your rug, yes, well with that money you can buy any number of rugs that don't have sentimental value for me. And I am sorry about that crack on the jaw.
Look, Jeffrey, you don't really kidnap someone that you're acquainted with.  You can't get away with it if the hostage knows who you are.
Well, uh. . . Not much to tell.
Uh-huh.
But your father--he runs stuff, he--
Huh.  Jeez.  Well, so, did he--is that yoga?
Yeah man, it really tied the room together--
Huh?  No!  What the fuck are you talking--I'm not--we're talking about unchecked aggression here--
Jeff Lebowski.  Come on.  This other Jeffrey Lebowski.  The millionaire. He's gonna be easier to find anyway than these two, uh. these two  . . . And he has the wealth, uh, the resources obviously, and there is no reason, no FUCKING reason, why his wife should go out and owe money and they pee on your rug.  Am I wrong?
You brought a fucking Pomeranian bowling?
First of all, Dude, you don't have an ex, secondly, it's a fucking show dog with fucking papers.  You can't board it.  It gets upset, its hair falls out.
Fucking dog has papers, Dude.--Over the line!
This is a league game.  This determines who enters the next round- robin, am I wrong?
Yeah?  Wavin' a gun around?!
What if it's during a game?
Huh?
Walter, face it, there isn't any connection.  It's your roll.
It's your roll.
My dirty undies.  Laundry, Dude. The whites.
My point, Dude, is why should we settle for twenty grand when we can keep the entire million.  Am I wrong?
What the fuck is going on there?
Easy, Dude.
Huh?
Fuck that!  I love you, Walter, but sooner or later you're gonna have to face the fact that you're a goddamn moron.
Your wheel, Dude!  I'm rolling out!
C'mon Dude, eventually she'll get sick of her little game and, you know, wander back--
They're gonna kill her, Walter, and then they're gonna kill me--
What about the toe?
All right, I'm leaving.  I'm sorry ma'am.
The bulk of the series.
Just ask him if he--ask him about the car, man!
And the fucking money!
What's your point, Dude?
Yeah?  What do you think happens when you get divorced?  You turn in your library card?  Get a new driver's license?  Stop being Jewish?
Three thousand years of beautiful tradition, from Moses to Sandy Koufax-- YOU'RE GODDAMN RIGHT I LIVE IN THE PAST!   I--Jesus.  What the hell happened?
Uh-huh.
Then what's...
Walter--
Dude, I'm--it was an accident!
It's uh, it's down there somewhere. Lemme take another look.
You told Brandt on the phone, he told me.  So where do I fit in?
You're just looking for a handout like every other--are you employed, Mr. Lebowski?
You don't go out and make a living dressed like that in the middle of a weekday.
Dude.
I don't know, sir.
Sure.  That and a pair of testicles.
Bunny Lebowski. . . She is the light of my life.  Are you surprised at my tears, sir?
Walter!
Help me put him back in his chair.
I'll tell you who I am!  I'm the guy who's gonna KICK YOUR PHONY GOLDBRICKING ASS!
What the hell are you doing, Blade?
We need it.  Sensations are addictive and pain cuts the deepest.  Tattoos, piercings, tribal scarring -- because we regenerate, none of it's permanent.  So we have to take it to the next level. To remind us we're alive.
He escaped.  You didn't tell me they were immune to silver and garlic.
What?
I don't think so.
For what?
Did you think I wouldn't?
Either that or feeding the worms.
These guys are shitting bricks cause they're no longer on the top of the food chain.  They're going to fuck us the first chance they get.
Look, I care about the humans who are dying, not you, got it?
For what?
Not alone.
Ultra-rapid detox.  They use it on heroin addicts, make 'em go cold-turkey in one night.
Human?
Yeah, but you fangs can see in the dark. What am I supposed to do?
They've made contact with the Reapers.
Two so far.
The pimp-mobile?  Just made a few after market modifications.  Nitrous-oxide injection system, forged aluminum pistons and crankshaft, higher flowing fuel pump.
Fuck yeah.  Whole package'll crank this betty up another three-hundred horsepower.
Don't even start, old man.
Maybe I don't see it that way.
Who is LaMagra?
Do it. You'll be dead before you can file the complaint.
Like me.
Serum -- it's a human hemoglobin substitute.
Your mother sounds like a Hallmark greeting card.
You make it sound like I'm already dead.
We get out of this alive, maybe I'll take that miracle cure of yours.
There's only one alternative to the serum.
What about the chemistry panel?
Jesus, Karen, you're breaking my heart here --
What makes you think we want to be cured? Blood is only part of the equation. The hunt, the killing, that's what the Thirst is really about.
Get away from him!
You've been bitten by a vampire. We've got to try and burn out the venom, just like a rattlesnake bite --
Go on, I'll be fine!
Hey, folklore--
I don't...I don't understand them myself.
A coward too. That's why she had to go.
Don't know--just that she was afraid--
I just wanna go <u>home</u>.
Mrs. Leavitt--
I haven't killed any--
--Nick!!
You sure?
It's a <u>sketch</u>, Anna--it's not to- scale cartography; the tree was not the kids' focus--
You said the name "James."
No idea. But if that's all we've got left--
--Cotter's--
Sleep.
--you should get back into bed.
What?
No.
Little boys. Looking up my skirt as I danced. Giggling.
--what're you saying?? I didn't have anything to do with--
--Christ, they find out I let you have it for the weekend--
You have to go.
No.
Oh, who did then? Blair Witch? Snatching equipment to make her own sequel?
Like hell. Play the goddamn tape.
Back it up, rewind, whatever you call it.
--fuckin' A right--
Yeah?
--coming out of the water--
Too busy eating us?
I spend a lot of time on e-Bay. Buying, selling--sometimes buying then re-selling at substantial mark-up, sometimes just selling crap I find in the street.
Heather, does that look like Domini there?
No one ever comes here.
--who?
It's a <u>serious</u> sociological study.
Look over there.
I dunno it's safe to even get out of the car.
First enormous brick warehouse on your right.
All I need--
A Cyber Entrepreneurialship.
I can't!
Maybe whatever they are, they just haven't appeared yet on her?
See what turns up--which I guarantee will be nothing. Some of the rest of the party are more hopeful--
You planning on sleeping out there?
Smells Like Teenage Spirit.
Why she kills children.
It touched me, don't you see it now?
I'm sorry.
Yeah.
I dunno it's anything. It's a name Anna's mentioned--from her dreams.
Domini.
Don't! You're making me lose my grip.
--or Lyme Disease or poison sumac, or God knows what-else we could have picked up in the woods.
I thought all witches were benign and good.
Does she, goddamnit??
There are <u>other</u> explanations! She is not the goddamn witch, that's insane!
I don't....
--it's urgent!
--the Sheriff's Office--
Who <u>is</u> this??
No.
I am?
Any time. But you don't have to worry about a thing for a while. Marty went down to Corpus yesterday.
I just gotta see a guy.
You got a girl--am I screwing something up by being here?
You can sleep on the bed if you want.
Door's locked. Nothing there.
...I don't know if you can fire a psychiatrist, exactly.
Thanks.
Abby... you all right?
I said you're bad.
I didn't think I could sleep. I'm surprised you could. Are you all right?
Ray--
Marty.
Isn't that what you want?
Remy.
Thanks.
Going out with Meurice.
We don't seem to be communicating--
Tell him the channels, Dusty.
Ever durned one.
Lubbock?
No.
Back where?
Abby, I like you, but it's no point starting anything now.
How long did you watch her?
Got a job for you.
I didn't say that.  Well?
Go down to Corpus for a few days. Get yourself noticed. I'll give you a call when it's done... You just find a way to cover that money.
Ya catch any fish?
Ya catch any fish?
...What kind of fish?
Of course.
How would I know?
What.
What.
Jack Daniels. Don't worry, I'm paying for it.
Meurice. Sorry I didn't show last night.
You we telling me about the Ring of Fire.
Aunt Barbara. I'll try not to get depressed.
No. I'm just going to walk around the neighborhood. Don't worry.
I'm not sick.
Okay honey. that sounds nice. Jeffrey. I think you've got termites in the house.
Fine Frank. Fine. How are you?
Darling, where are the glasses?. Oh. here they are.
Shit. let's drink to something else. let's drink to fuckin'. Say here's to your fuck Frank.
Right Ben. LET'S GO FUCK. I'll fuck anything that moves.
Yes.
I understand. I'm just real curious like you said.
The criminals are winning.
Only you. and the photo lab.
Yes sir.
Hey. Tits. I'm taking your neighbor to the country. maybe something for you too.
Then, shut up!
Those are my breasts.
Oh he forced you, huh?
Jeffrey nothing.
I wanted to see you.
Look. I'm sorry. Just let me leave.
I'll go then.
See my nipples?
Yes, I like you.
Do you know?
O.K.
Take it easy. What's goin' on anyway?. Why are you in so much trouble?
Please. please stay.
Hello.
I'm sorry .maybe I better go Dorothy.
I sure don't hate you.
I want you to stay with me.
Don?. Where is he?
What?
Okay Frank.
There ya go.
I just know, that's all. I remember you from Central.
Didn't my father tell you not to talk about it? 
My father is watching the businessman. The businessman had a partner who disappeared. left his whole business and family, his wife and two kids. They think he's been murdered.
Yeah. Good bye.
I didn't get a good look at him either, but he sure looked at me. I didn't have time to get a window, but I found this key.  Pretty nifty, huh?
Yeah.
Well, it's Friday night and you're a beautiful girl. I guess you would have a date. that does that.
I don't want you to get involved, really, I mean, I do, but if something went wrong I mean, like you said, they may be involved in murder.
It'll be okay. I don't think you should wait out here though. I think you should go home. Can you drive this car?
Could you wait a little while. this key may not fit.
I'm going in, Sandy. I'll see you tomorrow and tell you how it went.
Yeah.
No way. I'm about to blow up.
That's what I thought.
Goodnight.
You want to go talk to him?
That's what makes it so good. You wanta hear what I saw today?
You like mysteries that much?
Yeah. I think so. I just had to tell him some of what I knew. Is Friday still on?
Frank!!
OK. Let's get her over to your father's.
No Jeffrey!!
Yeah. I just saw him outside. Maybe the robins are here.
Hey Jeff.
uh uh.
Be right down.
I've made arrangements with Dr. Gynde for 10:30. But Jeffrey, you'll have to walk over; I need the car this morning.
Jeffrey, when you see your father.
He doesn't know you're out of school. He thinks it's a vacation for you.
Is something wrong? What's happened to your face?
I mean, you don't exactly have the build for a football. I mean. no offense.
Oh, yes, Jeffrey. Come in. He'll be back any minute now. You're welcome to wait. Is it urgent?
Sure thing. please don't worry about me. Can I help you with the dishes?
Yeah, nice meetin' yuh.
Mike. We don't have to watch it. Come on.
... Stop it Mike.
Um-hmm.
Motherfucker works fast.
No.  I have the space.  I figured it out.  This is what I want to do.
Five-thousand per kilo.
What is?
You happy, baby?
Oh my G-d, I'm so sorry.
I feel like shit.  Me and my frigging nosebleeds.
Which brings me to rule number three: which says, fuck rules one and two, skip bail and take off.
Man.  Fuck you guys.  I have this great idea and you guys have to be all skeptical.
Yes, I am.
Something about vengance being best served cold.
Excuse me?
What?  Yeah, sure.
It's a lousy fifteen kilos.  I piss fifteen kilos.
Excuse me?
I heard.
I don't like a lot of conversation, Diego.
I'm tired, Diego.  Go to bed.
I don't know.  A hundred, hundred and fifty.  How many miles is it from Colombia to Miami?
We'll refuel in the Bahamas.  I know someone there.
Perfect, George.  Perfect.  Everything is fine down here.  Everything is all set up.
And what happens when these guys stop paying?  Sooner or later, these guys are going to cut us out.  Then where are we?
Well, you better get here fast.  I'm sitting on...
Just sell it, Derek.
But to the victor belong the spoils.
Yeah.  Keep my mouth shut and let you do the talking.
Yeah.  You do the talking.
We're half a million off.
George, we've got sixty-one million dollars.  It's either here or someplace else.  We've got to put it somewhere. Unless you want to launder it.
Then relax.  It's a federal bank. Guaranteed by the government.  And Senor Noriega has very lenient banking principles.  No questions.  No problems. All the pesados keep their money here. Even El Padrino.  What do you worry? Everyone knows we are with Escobar.  Who is going to fuck with us?
What?
George, don't be so emotional.  This is business.  Besides, I can't kill you, you are my brother.
I don't know.  Maybe eighteen grams.
Oh, shut up, Fred.  Shut your big fat mouth.  You don't buy it all at once. It's called layaway.
Mom.
That's right.  Layaway.  Something you wouldn't know anything about, you cheapskate.
You, you big old tightwad.  He still has his communion money.  Tell him, George. Tell your father about layaway.
It's beautiful.
Power?
And Diego?
That's too bad.  You would have been the first one in the family.
I'm going to California.
Alright.  You want me to get your old job back?  Because I could, you know, I could put in that word.
Not mad.
Don't bullshit me, George.  I don't see you very much, I don't want to waste the time.
I heard.  Ermine, your son is here.
What about him?
We sell it.  I got it all figured out. We make three finger lids and sell them on the beach.  We move all of it.  We've made ourselves a hundred bucks.  Or a lot of weed for our head.  What do you think?  Not bad, huh?  I got the baggies and everything.
He's getting middled, too.  And Derek's our partner.  What's good for us is good for him.
I like fire.
Shhh, honey, never mind.  It's alright. It's over.  I quit the business.  I'm out.
Yeah.  I know.  She did that before.
Can you lift the furnace.  I need money.
What do you want me to say?  I'm in prison.  You should know.  You put me here.
Yeah, so I've been thinking.  I love her, y'know?  I kind of want to have her.  I've been away for so long.  Make up for the missed time, you know?
George, he wasn't asking.
Better than you.
What's happening to us?
Nothing.  I just wanted you to know I was out.  I just wanted to see you.
How are you doing?
I'll be here.
You swear?
Not today, George.  Time to go back.
Sounds fine.  I'll need to meet everybody.
I don't need a little.  I need a lot.
Shit, yeah.  Do you know how much money I could make if I had this stuff back east?
Who speaks Spanish?
Fuck yeah.  I never seen nothing like it.  I'm fucking wasted.
That's right.
Right.  And Holyoke.  There are a hundred thousand rich kids with their parents' money to spend, but there's never anything available.  Nothing good, anyway.  I'm paying four hundred dollars for shit.
Jesus Christ, I'm getting a boner just looking at it.
Don't be such a pussy.
I understand. What's your question?
Let's try to be precise then. The word "torture" does not appear in our orders. We have always spoken of interrogation as the only valid method in a police operation directed against unknown enemies. As for the NLF, they request that their members, in the event of capture, should maintain silence for twenty-four hours, and then, they may talk. Thus, the organization has already had the time necessary to render useless any information furnished ... What type of interrogation should we choose? ... the one the courts use for a crime of homicide which drags on for months?
And those who explode bombs in public places, do they perhaps respect the law? When you asked that question to Ben M'Hidi, remember what he said? No, gentlemen, believe me, it is a vicious circle. And we could discuss the problem for hours without reaching any conclusions. Because the problem does not lie here. The problem is: the NLF wants us to leave Algeria and we want to remain. Now, it seems to me that, despite varying shades of opinion, you all agree that we must remain. When the rebellion first began, there were not even shades of opinion. All the newspapers, even the left-wing ones wanted the rebellion suppressed. And we were sent here for this very reason. And we are neither madmen nor sadists, gentlemen. Those who call us fascists today, forget the contribution that many of us made to the Resistance. Those who call us Nazis, do not know that among us there are survivors of Dachau and Buchenwald. We are soldiers and our only duty is to win. Therefore, to be precise, I would now like to ask you a question: Should France remain in Algeria? If you answer "yes," then you must accept all the necessary consequences.
Sail.
It's true.
The NLF has condemned you to death.
They're not paying me anything. They've already warned you twice; this is the last warning. Decide.
You've got to change occupations, Hacene. Right away!
I'll explain.
C'mon ... you're exaggerating. The orders were to shoot him in the back.
Then don't complain.
Here?
With the others. They are trying to stop the people.
Yes ... yes. The problem also involves the UN. I don't know what it's worth, but this way, we'll give the UN the possibility of evaluating our strength.
I'm sorry. Tomorrow. Tonight is out of the question.
Intersection, between Consular Street and General Laquiere Avenue ...
Good evening, sir.
No. Let's just say that you've given me the satisfaction to have guessed correctly. But from the technical point of view, it isn't possible to speak of advantages. By now the game is over. The NLF has been defeated.
Yes ... But let me first see you.
Fine, Charlie.  You familiar with the Marsh case?
It could've happened to anyone.
She kills the old man and makes it look like Miss Lawson did it.  Pretty slick.
For starters I'd like to know why she left the house and didn't report the death?
Did I say it was a natural death?
What did he say about Miss Lawson?
How?
We know Marsh had a head cold.   We found cocaine mixed with water in a nasal spray container on the nightstand.  The coke would contract the nasal membrane the same as any decongestant, but for a much shorter time.  He'd keep using more and more -- never knowing what he was taking.
Very poor.  He was suffering from severe arterial disease.
We found a high concentration of cocaine in his blood.
We found a bottle of Dristan nasal spray on the nightstand.  It was filled with water and cocaine.  Mr. Marsh had a head cold at the time of his death.  I believe he wasn't aware that he was ingesting cocaine.
Yes.
Like cats and dogs.
You name it -- they argued about it. Mr. Marsh tried his best to keep her happy -- but it seemed that no matter what he did it was never enough for her.
Sit down, Frank.
Because she's clever.  Because she knows that even if we didn't find it we'd have suspicions as to why a man in Marsh's condition would use cocaine.
Then she's not as smart as I thought she was.  You've seen her in the depositions.  Tell me you don't have any doubts?
I was just about to make my point, Your Honor.
I'll rephrase the question.  Mr. Roston isn't it true you are bisexual?
No.  I haven't done it in years.
I assume his girlfriend.
Six years.
I opened the bathroom door one day and saw Miss Lawson pouring Cocaine out of a vial.
Yes.
Doctor Steven Trammel.  Cardiologist.
It was wild.  She was constantly trying to get me more and more worked up -- kinky things.  I tried to satisfy her the best I could, but it was difficult in my condition.
I had a bad heart.
It didn't.
She left me.
She didn't.  She just left.
Well -- I think that after the operation she realized that...
She said she was going to fuck me like I've never been fucked before.
She started touching herself and telling me how much she wanted me. She reached down and put me inside her.  My doctor had warned me about exerting myself -- but you really don't think of those things at a moment like that.  You just think about how beautiful this woman is -- how much you want her.  How deeply you want to please her.  At first it started off slowly -- but the rhythm built and built.    Every time I got close to an orgasm she would stop.  Eventually I started to have trouble breathing.  Rebecca just kept going -- faster and faster.  No matter what I said she wouldn't stop. I really thought for a moment I was going to die.
I couldn't help myself.  You get lost inside a women like her.  It was like a drug.  It was the best sex I ever had.
Thank you.  The State rests.
Cocaine.
Oriental medicine.
It's a white powder that comes in a vial.
Then -- those are not your own words?
Yes.
We dated for about a month last year.
He laughed -- and basically said he would decide when it was over.
While I was seeing Dr. Paley I mentioned to him one night that someone was stealing drugs from the third floor dispensary.   Three days after I spoke to him in his office he went to the Head Nurse and told her he had witnessed me stealing drugs.
There was an inquiry.  It was his word against mine.  They believed him.  I was fired.
Andrew was a kind and gentle man, but he was thirty years older than her. Where's the attraction to sleep with someone like that -- to have the kind of sex they had.
He video taped you.
It must have been horrible.  Having to go there -- seeing them together - - knowing he was sleeping with her in the same bed he did with you.
And didn't Miss Lawson come home one day and find you in bed with your male lover?
You're assuming the District Attorney is going to file charges.
Yes.
Oh -- Well, they're different.
I just wanted to see if my secretary called to confirm your appointment tomorrow.
It's okay.
No -- I wanted to be a professional hockey player.
What?
It isn't true.  You have to believe me.
You can see me now.
Are you scared?
The kids at school say she humped Mr. Marsh to death.
"Discourteous insinuations about his sexual abilities."  Who told you to say that?
Really?
And I suppose you're going to show me how to relax?
No -- it has to be done by tomorrow.
We're supposed to go to the lake.
Some example you set.
Yeah -- but can she cook?
I'll talk to him later.
Where have you been?
I'm not.
Talk to me.
It was a place to start.
Michael, you shouldn't be happy when someone else isn't feeling well.
Not even if they're a dork.  You should go by and see how he's feeling.
Daddy -- stop it!
We have a witness who saw you go into the house at four thirty.
What time did you leave?
Oh Jesus.
We're not doing it! I'm not even sure it's Christian.
Well, there's a lot of boring stuff to do. Lists of people we have to write to. Find mama's relatives addresses in Italy -- stuff like that.
I said NO!
Aw, Betty.
Mom's orders.
Well, there's a problem.
Michael.
Come here a minute.
Well, he just gets on about how if mama ever needed him, she could find him through the National Geographic magazine. He as a photographer. He promises not to write again. Then all it says is...  I love you... Robert.
I don't know. I'm completely in the dark here. That's what I get for moving away.
How did she meet him? Did Dad know? Anything else in that envelope?
Oh, don't feel sorry for me. Please. No one's forcing me to stay.
Boy. All these years I've resented not living the wild life in some place like Paris and all the time I could've moved back to Iowa... Are you drunk?
Was this during Betty?
They got heat in Michigan.
Oh, shut up! It's the woman who's in control of these situations. Men don't know which end is up till a woman points.
Oh, honey. I'm so sorry. But you've got to be grateful for even feeling the little you've be given. Believe me. Go to him. Don't let him leave without these new precious hours you've got left. And if you need anyone to cry on, you know where I am.
Yeah.
Oh, terrific. Which way?
No.
Uh-huh. Lived there till I was twenty or so and then moved to Chicago when I got married.
After the divorce.
Well, from Italy to Iowa -- that's a story!  Whereabouts in Italy?
Oh! You caught me.
Not at all.
A little place with cabins. The something-Motor Inn. I haven't checked in yet.
I guess. Except I'm one of the people it frightens.
Much.
That's very nice of you. I don't get many dinner invitations on the job. It would be a welcome change. Thanks.
My children. And Richard didn't like my working.
Umm, I don't know. I can look it up.
What?
I never got lost. For some reason, I'm more at home everywhere than at one place. So I decided I'll think of myself as some kind of world citizen. I belong everywhere and nowhere. I'm kin to everyone, and no one in particular. See, once you get into the habit of not needing anyone, it's kind of hard to break.
No.
I told you, I love other people.
Do you want to leave your husband?
Wonderful. Uh...
Oh, sure. Great.
No. I'll drive myself. I have a few errands. I'll meet you there.
How about Italy?
Have you ever been to that station?
No. I couldn't.
Because I already tried once.
What?
Yes, thanks.
What?
To do what? Be with someone who needs everyone and no one in particular? I mean, what would be the point. Would you pass the butter?
WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH IT?
Then he can move! People move!
I'm going to be here a few more days. I'll be at the Inn. We have some time. Let's not say any more now.
I CAN'T SAY GOODBYE YET! We'll leave it for now. We're not saying goodbye. We're not making any decision. Maybe you'll change your mind. Maybe we'll accidentally run into each other and ... and you'll change your mind.
Yes. And I've accepted.
Well you should all go to bed early. I'll do the cleaning up.
Later. Go back to sleep.
I can't sleep.
I'm not sick, Richard. I'm just not tired, now go back to sleep before you're up for the whole night too!
I'm going to miss you.
Hmm?
What's she like?
What happened?
Cremated?!
WHAT!
Who the hell is Lucy Delaney?
The man said just to use my imagination.  Let's see...yeah, I get it.  Potential. I can see it now.  The first major urban theme park.  Village Ghetto land. Kinda like Legoland, but made entirely from broken glass, hypodermic needles and crack vials.  Totally E-ticket.
Nothing.  Contact paranoia.  Must be buggin' from hanging with you.
Maurice, man, shut the fuck up.
Naw.  I think it's... I dunno.  Something about it just buzzes me.
Damned if I know.
Probably stoned out of his gourd in some corner.
Climb out to where?
Dad, the man has been lying to us for a hundred years.  I mean, where is my forty acres and a mule?
That's some terrible shit.
Big Bad Eddie Mack?  Got shit for brains and that's a fack.  Hey-heh...
I do alright.  Everybody's happy.
Don't you worry about a thing.  This hand's gonna be stroking the back of your neck tonight.
No.  Not...not you.  You I forgive.
They get about twelve and a half minutes. Tops.
We met.
How did you get in here?
I didn't want a piece of yours, I wanted my own.
I have to finish this for class.
I don't want you meeting around that house.  You stay away from those kids. And away from that dog.
Who was he, Momma?  He tried to kill us.
Who?
I don't.  Patrick doesn't.  And his brother and sister don't.  And they're in the house with him.
Naw.  But they will be.  They're the best.
I manage them.
My momma says every house is two houses. Every street, two streets.  There's a whole city, a whole world, kinda beside, on top, just below this one.  The city of the dead.
Yeah.  But when something bad happens, something really bad -- the wall breaks. The fabric tears.
I can't find you.
Let me see it.
It's...it's a bad neighborhood.  As you can see now.
You were just a kid.
Or you didn't know what to do with it.
Now you.
It was just like in my head.
Whattaya think?  Can you picture it? Over there the bar, and in here -- the dance floor.
Look, you guys want to play college radio, high school reunions, and some fool's club once a week for the rest of your lives, that's cool.  But I think we can do better.
The Gangster of Love don't eat no fried chicken.
Maybe there's a pipe underneath the floor.  It leaked and stained.
Should I?
How could that be?  The box was packed!
I'll have whatever Violet's drinking.
You're a dead man!  A fucking dead man!
What?  Oh, come on, I didn't use one of the good towels.
Why?  'Cause you know him?
What are you going to do with it?
What are you talking about?
Why?
I was getting out of the car when I saw him in the Mercedes.
Jesus Christ, Violet!  Open your fucking eyes!  Johnnie hates me like I hate him!
No.
For Christ's sake, Johnnie, do what he says.
What?
We're going to need some time.
I had to.  You made me.
They were in a car accident.
Sure, Gino, sure.
I should have let him kill you.
I knew I couldn't trust you.
No.  Rajeev's in India.
Why?
Hey, Mickey.
What?  They ain't there?
Yeah, it was Violet's idea.  I was so wound up about Gino, she was trying to help me relax.
Ssh!  I can't hear Gino!
All right.
I'm sorry, it's just you hear stories.
Pretty much.  One day at a time.
My pleasure ...  but to be honest, I did have a slightly ulterior motive here.  I was wondering if I could ask a small favor?
That is so amazing.  I'm in awe of people who can fix things.  My dad was like that.  We never had anything new.  Whenever something broke he would open it up, tinker with it and it would work.  His hands were magic.
Thanks.
I told Bianchinni I would take a look.  Is it that sink?
No.  Mr. Bianchinni asked me to do it.  I did it.
What do you want?
They took over a club I was working at.  Caesar started managing it.
How can you sit in that bed and say that?
Mickey?
How much money?
Is that what you think?
He hung it up.
Johnnie?
He does it right in front of him.
Gino doesn't know English, or at least he pretends he doesn't, so he doesn't talk much.  He gets right to the point.  Both times they talked for about five minutes, had one drink and then they left.
Scotch, Glenlivet.  I remember that Caesar made a huge deal about it.
An accident.
I won't.
You are as radiant as ever, Violet.
Jesus Christ, Pop.  You got two hours until your plane leaves.
Hey, Johnnie ...
Sure you're going to be okay?  I mean, if you're having second thoughts, my offer still stands.
I thought you were never going to do that.
I'm assuming we're exploring that possibility.
Yes, well, I think we need some fresh eyes on this problem.  I'm bringing in some people from upstairs.
What if he <u>is</u> working for someone else?  What if he turned?
...it's a problem...
...what did you do?...you must've really fucked up...
<u>There never was a Jason Bourne</u>.  You have to come with me.  It's the only way.  We can give it back to you...
MPG Capital.
I have a passport.  I've got...  Actually, it's a little complicated.
Yes.
Thanks.
Okay.
Great.  You know what?  I'll give you ten gazillion dollars to get the fuck away from me before I start screaming my head off.
I want to go home.
<u>No</u>.  No, that was too easy -- 
What?  Like amnesia?

-- which was okay for a while, I was okay with it...  But then -- there's all these other things -- all these other things I know how to do -- and this -- this stuff from the bank and...  I think something bad happened.
There was a gun.  Who has a safe deposit box with a gun and all this money and all these passports?
Where are we?
I thought about it.  I don't know.
That's it?  Is that it?
I don't remember any of this.
Go ahead.
-- please -- Jason -- omigod --
Marie -- look at me -- there's no time for this --
-- there's no time --
Let's go --  We got to get away from this phone.
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
Think I could rent a scooter?
-- I'm the one that got ripped off! -- not you -- not the United States government -- me -- I'm the one being ripped off!
-- I'm on it --
All of them?
-- we're evacuating the building --
-- he's running from the cops, he's got a bag filled with God knows what, he's in the building and I don't know where! --
<u>Where am I</u>?
I don't know.
Thank you.
I fixed it myself.
...ditioning.
Got there!
You don't have to sing it.
Yes, I know. It's the backlog, everybody complains. Was it all right otherwise?
David ... in a free society information is the name of the game. You can't win the game if you're a man short.
I understand this concern on behalf of the tax-payers. People want value for money and a cost-effective service.
Thank you, David ... and a very merry Christmas to you all.
That's all right Mr Helpmann. Glad to help.
Mr Helpmann. I've changed my mind. I'd like to accept the transfer - am I too late?
Yes, you've got to get me out of here. I've got to find her.
I assure you, Sam, I'm doing everything within my power. But the rules of the game are laid down, and we all have to play by them - even me.
Yes, well, from the Department's point of view you're certainly a bit of an own goal, but ...
Sam, I think I ought to tell you ... I'm afraid she's upped stumps and retired to the pavilion.
Yes, I know, fantastic, marvellous, wonderful - remember me to Alison - and the - er - twins.
Really? - God, how time flies!
Quite, absolutely - I always thought they were false.
SAM! What a surprise!
Thanks. Are you officer 412/L?
Ah ...
What is it?
No, no, I don't. I'm just beginning Honestly. Sorry, carry on.
You didn't know as much about this business as you pretended to, did you?
Barbara's a perfectly good name, isn't it?
What does that mean? I don't want to be involved in anything unsavoury.
We don't make mistakes.
I'm sorry, Sam, I'm afraid this whole case has become much more complicated since last we talked.
There are no coincidences, Sam. Everything's connected, all along the line. Cause and effect. That's the beauty of it. Our job is to trace the connections and reveal them.  This whole Buttle/Tuttle confusion was obviously planned from the inside. Bye bye.
Bastard!!!
You want Information Adjustments. Different department.
Information Adjustments.
Ah.
Oh.
Good!
No.
Them?
I don't want to hear about your fucking dreams!
I didn't run away. I left the flat.
I didn't like it.
It had a hole in the floor. Where are we going?
Ah ... Er ... It looks as if you're taking me.
Where are you taking me?
Well, all wars do -
Actual. terrorists? Well ... it's only my first day.
What? I thought you were free to come and go as you please.
You're joking.
Cut it out, Sam.
Information Retrieval.
Don't worry.
We've got to get rid of it! There's been a balls-up somewhere, and when the music stops they'll jump on whoever's holding the cheque!
I delivered it.
All enquiries to Information Retrieval. Which is hopeless, of course. They never tell you anything. But come the time they want something from us ...
Ah.  Would you mind if I borrowed your computer console?
Yes.
A woman eh? I see.
This is your dream girl, is it?
I'm sorry but ...
Yes he is - he wants to talk to you.
Um ...
He hadn't done anything ... He was good ... What have you done with his body?
What? Now? It's my lunch hour.
Numero trois, steak.  Monsieur, Mesdames, Bon appetit.
Thank you for calling Central Services. I am sorry, due -
What? Who is this?
Monsieur. Quel numero.
Fixed?
Fixed itself.
We'll be back.
Are you saying this is illegal?
Time to go.
I'm sorry Captain. Don't take it too hard.
Are you pregnant? Estas embarazada?
She's having a baby. Twins.
Two years. Ever since we left island.
He flipped out.
Mary said you might be coming.
I should be going. I just quit.
That's the stuff. I call it the Red Lion. Very king-of-the-jungle.
Just take it easy.
I usually don't do calls before coffee. But I think it might do you some good.  Twelve Young is here and I'm gonna take care of you, baby. Don't you worry about a thing, yahear, cause Marcus is alive and on arrival.
What's his name?
What'd you mean IB Bangin? What kind of name is IB Bangin?
Oh man, Bucky.
I guess there's always a chance.
The first is always the best.
At least he's got people around him.
You sure? I know my father would hate to be tied down. He wouldn't even go to the dentist.
It's best not to ...  It's good pizza, huh?
You remember that pizza place, Joe's on Tenth Street maybe fifteen years ago?  When you ordered a pie it came with a little plastic madonna in the middle?
Wow, you musta seen some things, huh? What's the worst thing you ever seen?
We can still go back. I'll walk you home. You sleep a couple of hours, watch some TV, take a bath.
No, no.
There's no time.
Frank.
Where the guy jumped and you almost fell. No, you never told me that story.
Make a left here. I want to stop.
What about rule number three: Don't get involved with dispatchers named Love.
She's no whore, Marcus.
She wasn't looking at you, man, she was looking at me.
I quit! I'm through!
What do you do, just have someone follow him around with a defribilator?
Crazy fucker.
Upstairs. 212. Had to shock him twice more.
Look up, Frank. Full moon. The blood's gonna run tonight. I can feel it. Our mission: to save lives.
Look out!
C'mon, Tom. The city's burning.
I feel the need, the need for speed. I'm driving out of myself.
Better bring it all.
You learn that in the army?
You're crazy.
You have no sick time, Frank. No time of any kind. Everyone knows that.
You really think so?
No! It's three o'clock. That can only mean one thing.
You know the other day I really wanted your reaction to how we did with the Libyan report -- I was going to ask but I guess I feel a little intimidated with you.
I'm starting to... We may do the capitols of the states.
We sure do.  I don't mean it as a knock either.  Go ahead.  I'll just say what I think and you can disregard it if you want.
No?
Yes.  And I'm sorry that they're sending you down for a while, but you'll make it back...Where they sending you?
It is.  Yes -- that's where they had Rorish, for God's sake, before they made him anchor.  I can't stand it -- they're grooming you for it all and you don't even know it.
Can I ask you something?  You only had one crew on the date rape piece, right?
No, I liked the way it made me sound. Okay.  Be good.  So long.
Yes.
I was there two years and was promoted on merit nine times.
At six o'clock on the wake-up news they used the wrong missile graphic.
Good night.
You want to start going over who they could have gotten?  They can't take on people like this for network news.  For God's sake.  What's going on?
Eleven and a half.
If we don't get to their camp soon, we won't be able to tape the supplies coming in.
I'll come by your place, right after...drink, take pills... Love you.
Right and we have the '81 pilot on the way in -- Nobody else will have him.
I figured out exactly why it is I'm so hung up on getting a chance at weekend anchor...It's because if I do that well, they'll pay me more, treat me great and my life will be better.  That's why.
I didn't know you were going with him.
Then it went well.
People phoned in.
I'm not kidding.
Call him -- I mean it can wait, right?
This is important to me.
Ernie told this story.  How he used to write obits and when the people in town called him up with death notices, he cried.  He was till that way when they promoted him out of obits.  He says you're lucky if you can get out while you could still cry.  I should have quit this place  three years ago.
In other times, for other purposes, there might be a band and bunting here at the bus depot for J.D. Singer's return from war.  He...
Just blunt talk, okay?  I'd really appreciate bluntness.
It's been a while since you read the news -- I'll have somebody work with you.  Just on superficial performance things.
Uh-uh.  I'm a little freaked right now about seeing my father though.
What is she shooting?
Almost immediately.
Yes, there is.
Yes.
Bobbie, please.
No, I don't think so.
Yes, it's true.  They're going to make it public Wednesday but isn't it a big deal for you to have it a day and a half early?
Thanks a lot, Buddy.
That's okay.
No.  Really...don't worry about it.
What do you mean?  You're one of the few people in this town I can talk to.
No.  They're firing even more people than they said.  Some will want to talk.  It could help.
Oh my.  I see you studying so hard, Tom.  What do you think the problem is?
What about the obvious remedy? Reversing things.  Maybe getting a job on a newspaper.
So, you're not well educated and you have almost no experience and you can't write.
Uh-huh.
No.  Aaron and I go to Central America on Wednesday -- so I'm cramming.
And it has nothing to do with the fact I left your room instead of staying there?
Some public official skipped a week on his Christmas Club?
What do you mean clean?
Okay.
Well, I'll go in and have a bite.
Okay.  You didn't like the party, huh?
What?
Well, what is it?
Nooo.  Is it your story?
Why, you need me for the story?
Great.
Well...
You just can't stop editing me. Huh?
Because you're nuts.
Three...I just thought of a third... If you talk about it, you don't have to do it.
Good...Another is you're trying to make it all about sex and heat and nothing else.
Where are you?
Well, when?
I know.  I taped it.
Not if you count 'Singing in the Rain.'  Do him a favor and don't treat it like a tragedy.  You want me to talk to him?
I've got my father coming through tomorrow anyway.  I should get some sleep.
He -- uh -- said he liked you because you looked like you had -- fire and honesty.
Yes, I am.  Thanks.  I mean it.
God Almighty -- Whew.  Do I mind? Why do I mind?  I do mind.  What a shock -- I don't have a right to... I don't think I like him.  I know I don't respect him...So what am I talking about -- what am I saying to you?
It would never occur to me to worry at all about you.
Yes, I'm sorry.
The way you were looking at me, I just went.
Uh-huh.
I already told you I'm not.
What!
Righto.
It's a...full length life-size figure!
Uh, well, I'm a little nervous, I never did a person before.
Now you're a professional!
Better!
Here here...
Yes Walter.
Tell us what you're going to make next, Walter.
Ready?  We've got plenty of time.
When did you make this, Walter?
Do you have to be so cold to him?
I wouldn't give up your day job.
I'm totally serious!
When do we get to see it? WALTER Well...any time, I guess.
I admit it.
Well, it all depends, Leonard...
Not only that, he copied us!
Well I was uh, just looking...
I don't have another cat!
Have a seat -
Now why shouldn't you, Walter? Things are different now...
What am I doing?  I'm just telling Walter the truth.
Yeah and what would I say?
Well Why not?  I gotta make statues Leonard.  You heard Maxwell, they want me to make them.  I can't go back to being a busboy!
Oh yeah that was Mayolia, she's a nice girl.  She's kind of strange, though.
C-connection?
Yeah yeah yeah - look!  I've heard this song and dance before, save your breath, you're coming with me! Lou goes to turn Walter against the wall but Walter springs back -
Turn around!
I see the rewards of achievement have come your way.
Walter, you did something to me with your work tonight.
If you were my son...why don't you let me fix you a nice hot bowl of soup, it won't take but a minute.
My arm!  He took my fucking arm!
I had him in my grasp.
Let's move out!
Suck!
That's it, man.  That's the whole story.
Do people ever call you 'Buffy the Buffalo?'  I'm just wondering.
Get away from here.
Down there.
I don't know, Mom; I've never met Bobby.
I... yeah, I'm okay.  I'm fine.
Hey, it works for me.  If they want to leave you alone in the house, all helpless and vulnerable...
You were having a nightmare.
I am so sure.
It could happen.
You guys are thrashed.
Hi there.
It was.  I think it's pretty much ready for the --
I'll back that up.
No, you're not.
Yeah?
Besides, Oxnard sucks.
Merrick...
I don't believe this.  The world's under attack by the legions of the undead and you're going to a mixer?
I'm glad you came.
Buffy, there's no way you're going out there alone.
Okay, guys, how about the ozone layer?
Like my homework.
Please.  They show previews for foreign movies.
Nice ensemble!
Kimberly, it's the senior dance.
Look, a lot's been going on.  That's what I wanted to tell you guys about. I need to tell you.  You see... a while ago, I met this guy --
I'm sorry.  That was impressive. The...  tumbling.
To bring you... your birthright.
You must believe me.  You must come with me while there's still time.
To stop the killing.  To stop the vampires.
I don't have time for your prattling. I have proof.  You bear the mark.
In Virginia.
Cramps?
It's true.
Yes, yes.  It would be interesting. A nice cheer.
Two days ago, would you have even hit me?  Let alone so powerfully?
Oh, several.  Lucretia Borgia, Joseph Mengele, Franklin Pangborn... are any of those names familiar?
Good Lord.  What do you study in history?
It's natural.  A reaction to their presence, to the... unnaturalness of it.  It's part of how you are able to track them.
A what?
Don't start with me again.
Buffy...
What do you want?  Encouragement?  'Gosh, Buffy, you're so special, I just want to give you a great big hug, oh I'm just having a warm fuzzy.'
Not if you're careful.
It's what I was raised to do.  There aren't many of us left, the Watchers.
Make time, okay?  You're the one who told me to act normal.  I've missed three practices already.  If I'm not there for the Barber game tomorrow everyone's gonna talk.
You're learning.  Slowly, incredibly slowly, but you're learning.
And where are they now?
Cassandra, you gotta come, too.
What, it's not weird.  I just cut the stupid hot dog in half.
I was just scared is all.
Cassandra's really smart.
My parents have money...
Are we so strange?  So alien to you?  I've seen this culture, the wealth, the greed, the waste... it's truly heartwarming.  The perfect place to spread my empire.  Honestly, Eastern Europe was so dead, the Communists just drained the blood out of the place.  It's livened up a bit in the past few years, but it's nothing compared to this.... this Mecca of consumption.  The city of Angels.
Wit-tay.
Like we don't have rights too?
Okay.
Right!
Hey, have you seen Benny lately?
You should think about leaving, too, man.  Sell this place... Something's going on here.  I don't know.  Something real weird.
Honey, don't ever listen to a woman when she's making love. They'll say the strangest things.
You see how nice things are when we go slow?
You can learn to like it.
Just do what I say.  Now, which nostril are you breathing through?
I'm really beat.  I need some serious "z's"--
Nuke?!
Get over here.
No, that's okay.  All I need's a little nap.
You can't seduce me.
Yes I do...
I'll be back when we lose.
You don't have to...
--but you're father's in there!
I won't be needing these anymore.
I got lured.
"I didn't get lured and I will take responsibility for my actions".
Oh my...  Don't leave...
I'm not interested in a woman who's interested in that boy.
Let me.
Crash, I get wet just thinking about you.
Who?
I can do that, too.
Oh let's not...
You're a regular nuclear meltdown, honey--slow down.
Jesus, what kinda broad are you?
You're in the wrong business, Jack--you're Sears-Roebuck material!
Beg me again!
'Cause you don't respect yourself, which is your problem, but you don't respect the game--and that's my problem.  You got a gift.
I ain't pissing nothing away--I got a Porsche already.  A 944 with A.C. and a quadraphonic Blaupunkt.
You been in the Majors?
I just wanta play everyday despite small nagging injuries--and go home to a woman who appreciates how full of crap I truly am.
Go for it.
I won't have to.
Yep.  So how's Annie?
Hey, guys, I got a game to pitch.
You fuck!
Forget it.
I know.  I just like to see you get all worked up.
You too...Meat.
Crash, shut the door.
From what I hear you couldn't hit a bull in the ass with a slingshot
Shut up--I like this song...  April in Paris, this is a feeling, No one can ever reprieve...
See ya at the yard, Meat.
It's a league record.
I'm Joe Riggins.  Sit down
I heard he's wearing women's underwear--and he's breathing through his pingala nostril.
I can't believe you're doing this.
Was I at that dinner?
This is a very auspicious occasion.
Philip, if you would rise.
But what happens when they do find out?
It's a tough proposition, Andy. You, you know, if I did it, I'd have to run it my way.
Excuse me.
Watch it, partner, watch it!
Jesus Christ! What gun? He's got a fuckin' hero sandwich here.
...I will let her in the house for five minutes if you gentlemen will escort her out if she happens not to want to leave. Because I don't - I -
No, it's - it'll just be a couple of minutes. We got other things to do too, you know. He'll hurry her up. How's everything else besides this?
Wait, hold on a second.
You fuckin' piece of shit.
Hey, little Dale Evans.
Well...
Got a lot of holes in the desert, and a lot of problems are buried in those holes. Except you gotta do it right. I mean, you gotta have the hole already dug before you show up with a package in the trunk. Otherwise you're talkin' about a half-hour or forty-five minutes of diggin'. And who knows who's gonna be comin' along in that time? Before you know it, you gotta dig a few more holes. You could be there all fuckin' night.
I'm sorry about this. Really.
That Black Book is a bunch of bullshit. They got two names in there for the whole country and one of them is still Al Capone.
Yeah, I believe it. You got banned.
Here, let's put a little of this on for you. I know you like this. A little butter, right, not a lot?
No, I don't wanna come -
I'll be honest with you.
Yeah, that's out of context. Okay.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, she comes to see me. She was upset about a lot of things, especially that whole fuckin' Diamond - that Lester Diamond incident.
...to me.
It's none of my business?
Me?! I wouldn't even be in this situation if it wasn't for you. You brought down so much fuckin' heat on me. I mean, every time I meet somebody here, the big question is do I know you.
Just give me the money. Fuckin' give me the fuckin' money, Sammy.
And what'd she want?
I don't know. What am I gonna do with this woman? I don't know...  She's drivin' me fuckin' crazy.
Well...
I think you're way out of line talkin' to me like that. What you're sayin' is libelous, and you're in no position to challenge my expertise. I went way out of my way to be very helpful and courteous to that kid. He's weak, he's incompetent. He jeopardizes the whole place. There's not much more I can do for him.
I'm sorry, I can't do anything. He's too incompetent. And the bottom line is, he cannot be trusted.
Seven o'clock.
Good to meet you.
No, Ace.
Ace, listen to me.
Why is she eight pounds over?
No. Just stop everything.
I wouldn't give the bum a mop job.
Nice to see you, Senator.
I don't care what she is. She's an institution, that's the problem. She's lazy.
Who's this?
She was a queen around the casino. She brought in high rollers and helped them spread around a lot of money.
You know I'm doin' well now. And I'm gonna do even better. And so, whatever happens, if it doesn't work out between us, I'm gonna make sure you're okay for the rest of your life. And if there are kids, especially, you know, I'll take care of you better than you'd ever imagine.
Okay.
It's chinchilla.
It's nice isn't it?
You do whatever you want. Do I keep my promises, or do I keep my promises?
Now look,  pay attention to me. What I'm gonna tell you is very important.
Isn't it bad enough you're drinkin' too much, you're takin' all my pills too?
Look - for my ulcer, I take a half a one of these, a half a one of these. And that's when I have extreme pain. I had a three-month supply. What'd you do with 'em?
Yeah, how do I know?
Okay.
That's all you care about.  You don't care about me at all.
I gotta tell ya...
What's it...
Yeah, yeah, I got the rest.
He needed some clothes.
He wanted a watch, too.
You hate my guts? I want you to come with me now.
Fuck you!
And don't send your guys down there to stop me! I mean it.
Okay. I want you to call Jennifer and I want you to tell her to tell you what she had for lunch, and I'm gonna listen in on the other line.
I can back him off.
You understand? What? Let you go?
I wou- I wouldn't do that if I were you.
Oh, fuck you! Fuck you, Sam Rothstein!  Fuck you!
What do you mean, what am I gonna do? I'm in the same clothes for two days! I want to get a few of my things! Big deal!
Don't you remember? You promised me a fair hearing when you were gettin' comped at my hotel and you were asking me for copies of your bills so -
We all have a past. You have a past, I have a past. And my past is no worse than yours. But you guys think you have the right to pass judgement on me.
How many kids do you have?
These are our best machines. They bring all the action. No wonder the drop is off.
The action is in the front, not in the back. Bring 'em up front.
Listen to me very carefully. There are three ways of doing things around here. The right way, the wrong way, and the way I do it. You understand?
Don't thank me, just do it. You're the Slots Manager. I shouldn't have to tell you this.
Well, it happened so quick. Three guys won. I didn't have a chance to call you.
I really think you're overreacting in this whole -
And don't forget to tell your friends what happens if they fuck around in here. You understand?
Shut your mouth!
Well, then, from now on, I'm gonna start keepin' records.
Oh, listen, I understand that there's always a risk... you know, I might have to take a loss somewhere.
I mean, you will try to push it through, won't you, Mr Clark?
Listen... Nicky... we talked about this... and, uh, I explained to you that there was the possibility you might have to take some kind of loss.
What're you gonna do? Strong-arm me?
I can't.
Mr Rothstein, why don't we just let her in the house and get a few of her things?  That way she'll get out of here. This is half her house anyway.
...metro intelligence cop. But it didn't matter. I mean, it was all about the kids, you know.
Well, listen, uh... Good luck with the joint, huh? 
Calm down! Calm down!
What?
I'll take care of it, Remo.
Ma che cazzo!
I'll be right out.
All right.
Want me to take this for you? 
Pleasure.  Very nice to meet you.
Oh, come on. I went into this with my eyes open, you know. I knew the bottom could drop out at any time. I'm a working girl, right?  You don't think I'm gonna go into a situation like this if I don't think I'm gonna get covered on the back end.
Am I right?
I should have never married him. He's a Gemini. A triple Gemini... duality.  Gemini's the snake. You know you can't trust the snake.  I mean it.
Well, I guess it's 'cause he loves you so much. He's jealous and worried.
No, I really do. I think he's gonna kill me.
Yeah, uh-huh... Okay.
Yeah?
Come on, come on, you're a toughie. You can take this.  Don't cry.
Is that what you want?
A sponsor.
Yes, I will. It's what you want, isn't it? Huh?
I told him I was Mrs Sam Rothstein.
But I saw something...
What money? I've seen you stealing from me.
No, Lester.
Okay, then.
No, I'm gonna drive.
Get up.
Let 'em complain. I'm the one who's here.
So are we.
Yeah, what'd you tell him?
Oh, he ain't nobody.
They'll do it.
Shh.  Hide her car in the back!
Get her the fuck out of here. Get her out of here.
Fuck you!
Ch-Charlie M!
Hey.
How you doin'?
Denying?
Oh, sorry -
Receipts and bills and... everything's here.
Nance gives me trouble and I'll tell him... screw around with those suitcases and I'll take the eyes out of his frickin' head.
I'm sorry.
You know, I - I'm too upset right now. And - An end has to be put to this.
You'll want to count the money in privacy. You know, you don't need...
Yew'll be ovah in the naxt tehn minutes...
I'll bet. Funny, for some reason, I don't think dogs are supposed to like me.
You're very special. Selina, I'm not a very good liar. I feel very strongly about you...forgive me use of architecture metaphors, but I instantly know a good foundation when I see one..
What little boy doesn't...  My God...it's, it's...Catwoman.
At some sanctimonious celebration of condescension. Nothing like appeasing half the population with a two hour luncheon.
Uh Brock, today you are without me...
You're telling the truth. I can tell..How did this..
I still can't get over it. I still can't believe you're Catwoman..
A couple that battles the forces of evil together is a couple that stays together.  Thank you, Jeff.
It would be honor, Brock. Now let's go get this guy...
I lied.
She has reason to be suspicious..Doesn't she?
But it's true!  You can call him yourself.
Your uniform, that first time I saw you, was a ghastly cage I vowed to unlock in order to..
I've been looking for you.  Selina Kyle was right. One of us is a psychotic crusader.
Wha-at?
I've been thinking. I've been thinking about us. I'm sorry I've been so hard no you these past couple days. I realize now it's because you're the only woman who ever understood me and I couldn't handle it!  I've never revealed myself to anyone the way I have to you. Let's blow this town together.  We'll run a bed-and-breakfast in Vermont by day, and by night, we'll dress up and kill anything that...
Now he'll be up all night...
Just a homeless woman. Wrong place.
"A superhero's job is to protect.." Sorry, I can't take you seriously...I overheard you say that tomorrow the Cult of Good will be dead--I should be so lucky--what did that mean?
I still have one left...
You're not strong. You're scared..scared that someone like me will see right through you. Whatever the Cult of Good was, it's not anymore... You don't have to listen to me, just listen to you..
Men, huh?
I actually got some memory back last night.
Enough.
Ah!  You scared me!  How did you know to come here!  Have you been spying..
Go together?  Sure, why not?  Another date with someone who could be an insane messenger of death for all I know. No offense. Hey, lean over, let me smell your breath..Say in a deep voice, "A superhero's job is to protect..."
You can't figure me out. You're the strange one..
Okay. Let's get serious. Of course I know the Cult of Good is not good. Ever since I saw what they did in Atlanta, it has been my mission to expose them. I've followed them to Oasisburg and soon will have enough hard evidence to bring them to real justice. That computer disc could be the final piece to the puzzle. This isn't just a story, Selina--another damn Pulitzer--this is my life.
Is every single thing out of your mouth since your "accident" have to be a monotone mumble of cheap sarcasm?
Oh, so now even the keepers of the city don't meet your standards...You're late.
What kind of name is "Brock Leviathan?"
I hate it when you let your hair just hang like that...you have such pretty eyes...
Do you always listen to what your mother says?  Selina. Something you choose your life. Sometimes your life chooses you.  Save the day..
Where do you think you're going?
Do I hear a woman's voice?
That's all we need.  Better let me drive.
This is my conversation.  I'll say what I fucking please.
Theo wants to talk again.
This Mercedes of yours, what's it look like?
Look -- I've got the lives of maybe three innocent people hanging on the end of this line.
Then whose is it?
No reason to kill innocent bystanders.  Shit.  I can't hardly move my neck.
I'm not staying in here with him puking all over the place.  Get this door open!
Yes sir.
Or relieve me of it later.
Can you make him stop!
I improved on the fucking original.
I'm doing fine.  Theo wants to deal.
You may be our only chance.  I don't know if I can do this again.
They gave me pills to make me sleep.  They didn't realize how much Seconal I'm used to -- that I'd have so much tolerance --
My name is --
My name is Lenore Oberfeld.
Then they took the Mercedes away -- with his body in it.
I'm in traffic.  There's no place to turn.
I hear them coming upstairs.  I won't be able to talk for awhile. I have to lay the phone down and pretend to be asleep.  So don't talk.  Don't say a word or they'll hear it.
Rachel!  They're going after Rachel now -- and I can't stop them.
Another minute.
What are you doing now?
Forget about us.  Just save Rachel.
I'm sorry if I caused you to lose your business deal.
Sometimes I paint.
I'm making my turn.  I see the school up ahead.
It's not your fault, Theo.  You tried.
When Jack sees they've got Rachel HE'LL tell them what they want to know.
To hide it from the I.R.S.
But I guess we haven't really met -- have we?
No.
Lucky for them they didn't.
I had a little encounter at the bank and our Mr. Transplant ended up under the wheels of a Chevy.
That's coming off.  How about the girl?
You're all three of you in that van?
I'm not leaving my daughter behind.  Not with them.
Just start walking.  Come on. Walk to me.
She'll be with you soon.  They're pulling up.  They'll realize I kept my part of the bargain.
Why didn't you just shoot them?
Why are you telling him that.  Are you crazy?
There isn't any such person.
The video cameras will put you with him in the bank, and I'll bet there were enough witnesses.
You won't shoot me.  That's not your style.
I think it was my tone of voice more than anything else that sold you.  And when you thought I was being kicked around, I wish I could've seen your face.
You wouldn't --
Let me talk to him.  Hold the phone to my ear -- but don't nudge me.
Ask them.
As a child I hated being told how sweet I looked.  That angelic little face wasn't me at all.  I had to hurt people to prove to them they had the wrong image. Sometimes words were enough -- but I wasn't beyond inflicting physical pain in order to be taken seriously.  I enjoyed seeing the shock on their poor faces when they realized who I was.  That same look you gave me when I turned the gun on you.
We had a backup plan.  But I knew you'd come through for me.
The cop in the trunk -- he could still be alive.
Only one way to find out.
Local lawyer for Dominican dealers.  Off to buy a half interest in a mall in Granada Hills on their behalf.
Sure, like I'm gonna take advice from you.
There are no guarantees in this life.
Tell the lady to relax.  Tell her I can't wait to meet her in person.
I make my end of the cash at 184,000.  Now I'm trying to figure out the bonds.  What the face value is.
My pleasure --
She's yours.  What are we waiting on?
What are you planning to do when they got here?  They'll kill us. They'll kill Rachel.
Call me "Nels."
And I end up in a fucking neck brace for life!
I thought you'd know me by now.
Sweet revenge plus maybe a bit of vigorish off your end.
Five minutes.
In your dreams.
Who are you?
Hold on.
Your partners are currently armed and we're not.  Our edge is that they don't know we're in touch.
From here on, I dish it out.
Yeah.
So who's he?
Yeah?
Nice.
She wants to know, sir, do you like your hair.
Hi.
Who the fuck is he?
Please, Dil --
Fuck off, Dave.
What?
Two hundred quid, Mr. Deveroux.
Bloody right I do...
Who's she?
He wants me to perform for him.
You know.
Where?
What look?
Like what?
How special?
Tried to. Sit down, will you?
Yes...
I am.
Want to look after you.
Something I heard someone say once.
Yeah.
If I told you, you wouldn't believe me.
I'm wondering why you keep his things.
Never said a truer word.
You mean that?
Ask to meet me again.
When?
I miss you, Jimmy.
Don't be cruel.
He'd bring me carnations.
Not at all, honey.
Okay.
You gonna tell me why?
You following me?
What's her?
Kind of.
I'm not sure.
A girl has to draw the line somewhere --
What?
I'm going home!
Thought you was fooling me. Thought you was leaving me.
No! I'm going home...
You mean that?
Don't go like that.
Did you hear me?
He asked me to see were you all right.
I like you, DIl
It's my name, Dil --
I asked you a question, honey -- were you there too --
Tell me what she wore.
Am I in trouble, Jimmy?
I promise.
Don't call me that --
Please, Dil --
Ever so nice. Aren't you, Jimmy?
Absolutely. The younger the better. Doesn't come your way much, I suppose.
Horny bastard.
Can't.
Leave me alone, Jude.
No way, Jude. I'm out.
I take pride in my work.
Do you want a cup of tea?
It's nothing. He's just got a sense of humor, that's all.
Who'd you think it was?
You being cynical, Hennessy?
Can't.
So, what do I look like?
Am I?
Five ten. Brown eyes. But you're no pinup.
Nope. Not handsome at all.
No.
Absolutely not.
Ever see hurling?
The fastest.
Means what it says. The scorpion does what is in his nature. Take off the hood, man.
Like what?
My special friend.
Present tense, please. Love her. Whatever she is. I'm thinking of her now, Fergus. Will you think of her too?
If they kill me --
I told you not to talk that way --
And the scorpion. No. Tell me anything.
Yeah?
No.
Cricket's in the halfpenny place.
Hurling --
Thought you liked me, bitch.
Shut the fuck up, Jude.
That true, Fergus? You in love?
No, we are.
First her husband, now her -- she hoodwinked you! She batted all them big eyes and you went 'n fell for it - like a egg from a tall chicken! Here!  You want? Here -- it's yours!
I think that's what you ordered.
I'm not hungry -- isn't it glorious?
Relax -- you're gaining.
Adam --
The tooth powder. Wait a minute -- could you recognize heroin just by tasting it?
I love you, Adam.
With whom? Where?
There is? Well, I can't say I think very much of a silly law like that. Think, Reggie -- please think -- what was written in Charles' notebook?
I know, but this is all we've got left.
Then who did? You're the only one left.
No!
What makes you think they're even interested? It's only a quarter of a million -- it'll cost more than that to fix up their bookkeeping. As a taxpayer --
No thanks.
Agent.
I'm sorry it's impossible. It's the truth.
Because they're still here.
Yes, where?  -- in fifteen minutes. I'll be there.
Who?
That's not Carson Dyle.
There's only one Dyle connected with this affair, Mrs. Lampert -- that's Carson.
Please go on, Mr. Bartholomew -- what happened then?
I'm sorry, Mr. Bartholomew, but nothing you've told me has changed my mind. I still intend leaving Paris -- tonight.
Me? Why me?
Agents.
Do you know him, Mrs. Vo -- Mrs. Lampert? Leopold W. Gideon?
The last one, please.
Crooked? I should think you'd be glad to find out I wasn't crooked.
Mrs. Foster -- send a memo to Bartholomew at Security recommending that --
Okay, now -- hand over those stamps.
Who asked you to get stuck with any of them?
Yes.
How about if next week some time I put it on a marriage license -- that ought to --
I wouldn't lie on a thing like that -- I could go to jail.
I said with the mouth shut.
What's wrong, Herman -- have you got something to hide?  Then I take it there are no objections.
No cat and mouse -- you've got me. What do you want to know?
But you know my name -- it's Dyle.
Haven't you got a bullet I can bite?
Alexander.
Yes, but we're divorced.
Well, there's your trouble right there -- you're too old for me.
Oh. 
Why?
What -- like Scobie?
First your brother, then Charles, now Scobie -- we've got to do something! Any minute now we could be assassinated! Would you do anything like that?
This is a ludicrous situation. There must be dozens of men dying to use my shower.
Fiction or non-fiction?
Go on.
Do you have anything to eat?  And the orange one -- what about the orange one?
No. For a few minutes they were mine -- that is enough.
And if it is?
Meaning what?
You know I'd tell you if I had it.
Tell me what?
I'm very cold.
Swiss.
I don't know.
I don't know. Perhaps he met somebody.
Yes. Your appointment has been changed.  One key to your apartment -- one comb -- one fountain pen --  one toothbrush -- one tin of tooth powder  -- that is all.
It stands to reason you are telling the truth -- for why would you invent such a ridiculous story?
-- you could have the stamps. I'll get you some here, okay?
Oh.  Neither do I.  Voil?!
I found it! I found it!
I'm afraid you're blocking my view.
No, it isn't. I'm getting a divorce.
Yes, I am -- I'm compulsive about it -- dishonesty infuriates me. Like when you go into a drugstore.
That wasn't a proposal -- I was just curious.
How do you know?
Well, the idea's right, anyway. Are you going to call me?
Charles is.
I phoned but nobody answered. I wanted to tell you how sorry I am -- and to find out if there was anything I could do.
Something like that. But I'm sorry it ended like this -- tossed off a train like a sack of third-class mail.
No, everyone. Come on -- avanti, avanti!
What was what?
Good night.
I think I sprained my pride.  Where'd he go?
That's all right -- it's a drip-dry.
What are you talking about?
Words can hurt very much.
I don't understa--
Wha -- what do you want?
No -- no, I'm don't.
Yes, ma'am. A little one -- 'bout seven or eight years old. Th' little tyke keeps callin' you his Aunt Reggie -- ain't that cute?
Va jouer, mon ange.
Oh la vache!
Hello, Reggie -- I am waiting for Jean-Louis.
Don't be un-neighborly-like, Herman -- don't forget he done us a little ol' favor.
I wonder why it's so important to know if they fucked?
Me too. I'm going to start telling people that I saw her drop to her knees and latch on to his unit vector.
Oh GOD Brent, is there anything you don't feel guilty about?
Daddy you scared me!
You never went, uh, all the way?
I thought you'd be pleased.
Nothing. I just picked up the phone to say goodbye to you. You didn't say goodbye.
Run!
Are you sure?
This will relax her.
You know where I can find her?
She works at a church?
No. She ate a pistol for lunch one day.
Can you just follow me? The back is full?
You know about that too?
Really?
Because of your father. The way what his sins shaped you.
Lisa Sherman was my mother. Do you know who that is?
I was desperate. It was gross.
Maybe I should blister through a bottle of Tequila and just fuck his brains out.
Want to come in for awhile? Log onto AOL, flirt with some married men, head into a private S&M chat room . . .
I keep a couple of my dad's porno books hidden in my desk for emergency reference.
There will be a lot fewer by tomorrow night.
FINE. Are you?
What party?
Ok.
I won't.
Yeah. I think it's really sick.
Did Sharon say no?
I have to go home after school. I have something really important I have to ask my mom.
I can't believe I listened to one word of his shit.
Yeah.
Then go to the party. Run with the herd Kenny. Just don't spew out all that 'be an individual, assert yourself' crap anymore.
Yeah. Who is she?
That's what he said.
Who is she?
People thought these guys had a right to rape her because she called them 'queers'?
The men. Do any of them still live around here?
There's going to be very few virgins left in school on Monday. It could be really dangerous for them if the killer isn't caught.
And she didn't?
They're tasty.
No, you keep one.
So are you.
Maybe you better just drive me home.
Yeah. I'm extremely worried about that. It's right up there with global warming.
If sheep don't count.
Yes. Unfair to me.

Probably.
Tell me. What do the police say?
Where from?
Honest?
It's what the D.A. used to tell me about Chinatown.
Yeah.
When was the last time?
How did you find out?
What is it?
Yes... I think I can manage...
That you killed Hollis Mulwray.
Just incorporate the Valley into the city so the water goes to L.A. after all. It's very simple.
I have no idea. How much do you want?
Do you remember the figures we discussed?
At your daughter's house. How soon can you get here?
No thanks.
Could you drive me somewhere?
Tell her later.
Well you own a lot of land.
The apple core club.
How'd you get past the guards?
I get by.
Uh-huh. So what are you doing here?
Who?
Oh yes.
No.
You mean that's what you're going to call it.
I don't think about it one way or the other. But if you want, give me a day or two, and I'll get back to you. Now I'd like to go home.
And why's that?
C'mon I'll show you.
I guess not.
Mrs. Mulwray, do you happen to know the name of the young woman in question?
A private investigator?
Yes, that Mulwray, Mr. Gittes. And since you agree with me we've never met, you must also agree that I haven't hired you to do anything. Certainly not spy on my husband. I see you like publicity, Mr. Gittes. Well, you're going to get it.
Mr. Gittes, you've talked me into it. I'll drop the lawsuit.
I said I'll drop it.
Mrs. Mulwray?
I don't want to drop it.
What do you mean?
Suppose they did. How does it concern you?
I have?
But he wasn't killed.
Did you have affairs?
You were seeing someone, too.
I don't see anyone for very long, Mr. Gittes.  It's difficult for me. Now I think you know all you need to about me. I didn't want publicity. I didn't want to go into any of this, then or now. Is this all?
Been meaning to talk to you about that.
Money. How they plan to make it by emptying the reservoirs, that I don't know.
Not exactly. Well, I mean, yes. Yes and no.  Hollis felt the public should own the water but I don't think my father felt that way.  Actually, it was over the Van der Lip. The dam that broke.
No, I think I'd remember.
No question from you is innocent, Mr. Gittes.
Actually this hasn't happened to me in some time.
There's something black in the green part of your eye.
That you were jealous, and he was worried about what you might do.
Mulwray's girlfriend, for one thing. He wanted to know where she was.
She's not tied up!
What about?
You won't go to the police if I tell you?
Aren't you coming back with me?
Sure.
No...
I don't know. I mean yes, probably.
What are you saying?
...no...
Katherine.
To Mexico...
...so that's why you hate him...
But, Mr. Gittes.
It's on your desk. Say, you hear the one about the guy who goes to the North Pole with Admiral Byrd looking for penguins?
Jesus, that's in Chinatown, ain't it?
Oh yes we have... are you alone, Mr. Gittes?
Oh no.
No, Mr. Gittes. Just look in the obituary column of today's Times...
Ida Sessions.
Don't be sorry, neither does Dad. Wanted to make sure though, didn't we, honey?
I don't think so. Be happy to show you.
Hope so. He's working for us.
Yeah, must be especially tough to take over under these circumstances.
I never was.
Well... I think I... I would've remembered.
Yeah, under Hollenbeck Bridge, what's wrong with that?
Yeah.
Sure you do.
Money doesn't matter to me, Mr. Gittes.
May I ask what this is regarding?
Yes. No.
He owned it.
Yes.
They got into a terrific argument outside the Pig 'n Whistle.
I don't know. The traffic was pretty loud. I only heard one thing - apple core.
All she needed for that was the phone book!
Yeah. What's wrong with you guys? Think ahead. We find 'em, sue 'em. We'll make a killing.  We'll have dinner at Chasen's twice a week, we'll be pissing on ice the rest of our lives.
She ain't exactly long in the tooth now.
You don't say?
It tastes wonderful!
Who knows?...It's like an adventure.  Hope springs eternal... 
OK. OK. But now that I've got a job, I'11 probably stop going...
Progress! It always arrives too late!
Nothing, there's nothing. It's all out of focus.
What's she like? What's she like?...
What you say is wonderful! But sad...
Just so, Alfredo. There isn't any. And if you buy a television set, you can watch it at home, without any fuss...
I know. But take the-miracle of the loaves and fishes, for example! I think about it a lot...How is it possible for...
Elena. My name's Elena.
Yes, nice day.  ...I've got to go now. Bye-bye.
We'll talk about that later.
I got back today. You can't imagine the excuses I had to make up to be here...
Good, this way we can finally talk. I'll convince him this time.
Who?
Sure, sure! Boccia...  What's he do?
Alfredo, damn him! He cast his spell on you too!
What difference does it make to find an explanation? That's the way it went. But Alfredo didn't betray you, he was the only one who really understood you. Salvatore, if you had chosen to be with me, you'd have never made your films. And that would have been a pity! Because they're wonderful, I've seen them all.  But you shouldn't have gone and changed your name. You should have kept your own.
I'll never agree with you. Never, Elena.
Somebody stole it.
It's not true! No! It's not true!!! I'll show you he's coming back!
What the fuck you talking about? You getting into the act too, Toto? Titanus has trouble giving me even one copy and I have to say thanks! If I ask for two, the least they'll do is cut off my head and play ball with it!
Six years ago this May. No one came any more. You "know better than me, Mr. Di Vita, the crisis, television, videos. By now the movie business is only a dream. The city's bought it now to make a new parking lot. Next Saturday they're tearing it down...A pity!...
How are you, Mr. Thatcher?
I rather like it myself.  Send it right away.
I can't take shorthand.
Two cents.
Re-figure it, Mr. Bernstein, at two cents.
I know.
You don't really think so?
And the social.  How about the music notice?  You got that in?
-  We thought maybe, if we can find out what he meant by that last word - as he was dying -
Not some girl he knew casually and then remembered after fifty years, on his death bed -
I'm calling on people who knew Mr. Kane. I'm calling on you.
You know why?  She was so -
I'm going back there.
He made an awful lot of money.
I guess Mr. Kane didn't think so well of Susie's art anyway.
Certainly not.

Yes, Mr. Bernstein.
Hello, Bernstein.
It is accepted, Mr. Carter, with assurances of my deepest regard.
It isn't finished?
Has he said when he'll finish?
I made Miss - Miss Alexander send you the note.  She was a little unwilling at first -  but she did it.
The story about him and Miss Alexander, Mrs. Kane.
Chicago is pretty close to New York nowadays - only twenty hours -
I'm surprised he got the votes he did.
Too late for what?  Too late for you and this -  this public thief to take the love of the people of this state away from me?  Well, you won't do it, I tell you.  You won't do it!
I know exactly what I'm doing.  Get out!
What's the matter with you?
If these sidewalks were kept in condition - instead of the money going to some cheap grafter -
I always like to see the funny side of things.  No sense crying when you don't have to.  And you're so funny.  Looking at you, I forget all about my toothache.
And I know too many people.  Obviously, we're both lonely.  Would you like to know where I was going tonight - when you ran into me and ruined my Sunday clothes?
Oh, you wouldn't want to hear me sing.
That's when you've got to fight them. That's when you've got to make them. That's -
We can discuss all this some other time, Susan.  Right now -
Susan!
Susan, it seems to me -
- And left?  Of course they'll hear.  I'm not saying goodbye - except to you - but I never imagined that people wouldn't know.
In case you don't know, Emily, this - this gentleman -  is -
Don't you worry about me.  I'm Charles Foster Kane.  I'm no cheap, crooked politician, trying to save himself from the consequences of his crimes -
It's the only vein I know.  I tell the facts the way I see them.  And any man that knows that facts -
I don't know how to run a newspaper, Mr. Thatcher.  I just try everything I can think of.
Can you prove it isn't?
They're all part of your general attack - your senseless attack - on everything and everybody who's got more than ten cents in his pocket. They're -
Yes, sir. 
Do you know what that is?
It's been a tough day.
It's a good idea for a newspaper.  Four hundred sixy thousand.
Our readers are, anyway, I don't know about the rest of the country.
But there is no Front, Charlie. There's a very doubtful civil war. Besides, I don't want the job.
Why not?  Well - nobody's a great man in your estimation until he's dead.
You've said a lot of things about the President in the last few months.
Go ahead.
What's wrong, Brad?
She's going to leave you -
She was going to leave you anyway -
You're not going to like it in Chicago.  They wind comes howling in from the lake.  And there's practically no opera season at all - and the Lord only knows whether they've ever heard of Lobster Newburg -
Nothing - if she dosen't love me -
I know you will.
It is.  Go on, Mr. Thatcher -
That's what you think, is it, Jim?
Never mind -  Bernstein told you about the first days at the office, didn't he?  Well, Charlie was a bad newspaper man even then.  He entertained his readers, but he never told them the truth.
I can remember everything.  That's my curse, young man.  It's the greatest curse that's ever been inflicted on the human race.  Memory -  I was his oldest friend.  As far as I was concerned, he behaved like swine.  Maybe I wasnt' his friend.  If I wasn't, he never had one.  Maybe I was what nowadays you call a stooge -
The Bank's decision in all matters concerning his education, his place of residence and similar subjects will be final. 
This is Mr. Thatcher, Charles.
There's a part of a Scotch castle over there, but we haven't bothered to unwrap it.
Turn that thing off, will you?  It's driving me nuts!  What's Rosebud?
But don't you think if we release it now - he's only been dead four days - it might be better than if -
Sentimental fellow, aren't you?
I had a toothache.
Am I sure about what?
What the hell is that?
It's a trach ring. It's what they install in your throat when throat cancer takes your voice box. This one came out of a sixty-year-old man.
It's never too late. Give those cigarettes back now, and buy some gum instead.  Here. Chewlies Gum. Try this.
It's a picture of a cancer-ridden lung. Keep it.
Now he's going to launch into his rap about how he's just doing his job; following orders.  Friends, let me tell you about another bunch of hate mongers that were just following orders: they were called Nazis, and they practically wiped a nation of people from the Earth... just like cigarettes are doing now! Cigarette smoking is the new Holocaust, and those that partake in the practice of smoking or sell the wares that promote it are the Nazis of the nineties! He doesn't care how many people die from it! He smiles as you pay for your cancer sticks and says, "Have a nice day."
Can I watch?
Can I join in?
Few are. So what makes you think you can maintain a relationship with Dante this time around?
He went home to change for the big date.
No, don't!
Let's not talk about that. How'd you get home?
Were you going to tell me or just send me an invitation?
Is that what they teach you at that school of yours? Kind of, sort of? Everyone knows about this except me! Do you know how humiliating that is?
Wreck is a harsh term. Disturbed is more like it. Mildly disturbed even.
Yeah, but not seriously. Christ, you're ready to walk down the aisle- I'd say that constitutes something more than just seeing somebody.
If he's so nice, why aren't you going to marry him?
You lie.
Jesus, you're caustic.
Give me a bit more credit. I think it's time we got back together, you know. I'm more mature, you're more mature, you're finishing college, I'm already in the job market...
Cute. Tell me you wouldn't want to go out again. After all the talking we've been doing.
Yes. A real date. Dinner and a movie.
He went to rent a movie, but he hasn't gotten back yet. Ah, screw it; I'll just lock the store up and leave him a note.
Yes.
I know. I'm sorry. Let me refund your cigarette money, and we'll call it even.
What's your point?
What the hell are you doing here? I thought you were playing hockey at one.
No, thanks.
I'll bet the most frequent topic of arguments is Caitlin Bree.
I'm going to offer you some advice, my friend: let the past be the past. Forget Caitlin Bree. You've been with Veronica for how long now?
Chick's nuts about you. How long did you date Caitlin?
Oh, my God.
That's frightening.
In light of this lurid tale, I don't see how you could even romanticize your relationship with Caitlin-she broke your heart and inadvertently drove men to deviant lifestyles.
Oh yeah.
There's more?
Luke blew it up. Give credit where it's due.
Basically.
Not just Imperials, is what you're getting at.
Wait.
He said he has to find a perfect dozen.
Each egg has to be perfect.
Who cares? That lady's an asshole. Everybody that comes in here is way too uptight. This job would be great if it wasn't for the fucking customers.
How can you lie like that? Why don't you vent? Vent your frustration. Come on, who pisses you off?
Let's hear it.
FUCK!
You know what pisses me off the most?
Sorry.
I've gotta tell you, my friend: this is one of the ballsiest moves I've ever been privy to. I never would have thought you capable of such blatant disregard of store policy.
Can we not talk about this?
Randal, twelve minutes is not a game! Jesus, it's barely a warm-up!
Gatorade.
Exactly. They drank it all.
"It's not like we're gonna sell out."
Embolism in her brain. Yesterday.
Paulsen's Funeral Parlor. The next show is at four.
How'd he die?
Bible truth.
I swear.
No, because you won't admit to it. As if a guy's a fucking pervert because he tries to go down on himself. You're as curious as the rest of us, pal. You've tried it.
Yeah, but at what a price.
Reach what?
I don't want to talk to you.
Let me borrow your car.
If you must.
I see. So playing hockey and attending wakes-these practices are standard operating procedure.
I like to think I'm a master of my own destiny.
I'm not. She just left.
This is my way of spitting water at life.
Bunch of savages in this town.  Hey, Caitlin's in the back. You might want to see if she's okay; she's been back there a long time.
WOULD YOU SHUT THE FUCK UP?  WHO THE FUCK IS IN THE BATHROOM?
I'm stuck in this pit, earning less than slave wages, working on my day off, dealing with every backward fuck on the planet, the goddamn steel shutters are locked all day, I smell like shoe polish, I've got an ex- girlfriend who's catatonic after fucking a dead guy, and my present girlfriend has sucked thirty-six dicks.
My life is in the shitter right about now, so if you don't mind, I'd like to stew a bit.
I should shit or get off the pot.
What responsibility?
You're wrong. Things happened today, okay? Things that probably ruined my chances with Caitlin.
Jesus.
Oh please! I'm surprised I didn't kill you.
Why do I say that?  Randal... forget it.
Which means the video store is ostensibly closed.
Unless you're out renting videos at other video stores.
Do you need a hug or something? 'Cause I would have no hang-ups about hugging you... you know, you being a guy and all. Just don't knead my ass when you do it.
Thirty-fire.
THE GLADES MOTEL?
Jesus Christ, what next?
Yeah?
Forget it. I don't want to deal with a guy that sells cigarettes to a five-year-old.  Can I offer you a ride somewhere?
'Bout the biggest pair you ever seen! NYNNE!!
A half hour.
With you? I don't think so.
How do you figure... HEY! You can't roll a joint in here!
It's not my store.
I jacked the car up. All she did was loosen the nuts and put the tire on.
She's my girlfriend.
Well, that depends. Do you have a bathroom?
The guy got sick and couldn't come in.
I don't know-like two-thirty, three.
Who's defensive?  Just... Would you just hug me?! All right? Your boyfriend was accosted by an angry mob, and he needs to be hugged.
Theoretically, people see money on the counter and nobody around, they think they're being watched.
How many what?
Including you?
I'm not the pig you are.
He gets off on it.
I'm serious...
That's because I never had sex with him!
Because I did only sleep with three guys! That doesn't mean I didn't just go with people.
Dante...
...it isn't there. Yes.
You've been talking to her on the phone for weeks!
And then you pull that shit this morning, freaking out because I've gone down on a couple guys!
I don't want Caitlin...
According to the NJAC-the New Jersey Administrative Code, section eighteen, five, slash twelve point five-a fine of no less than two hundred and fifty dollars is to be leveled against any person reported selling cigarettes to a minor.
An angry mother called the state division of taxation and complained that the man working at Quick Stop Convenience sold her five-year-old daughter cigarettes today at around four o'clock. Division of taxation calls the State Board of Health, and they send me down here to issue a fine. You say you were working all day, hence the fine is yours.  It's doubled due to the incredibly young age of the child.
The due date is on the bottom. This summons cannot be contested in any court of law. Failure to remit before the due date will result in a charge of criminal negligence, and a warrant will be issued for your arrest. Have a nice day.
You gotta hear him sing.  Olaf, "Berserker!"
He's moving to the big city next week. He wants to be a metal singer.
Oh, I know. If I had to work here all day, I'd be bloated and out of shape, too.
Because he's out of shape.
Oh yeah. You were the built older guy with the black Trans and the big...
Yo, don't sell all that. 'Cause I'm gonna get the cash and buy it from you at John K's. You're gonna bring it, right?
Yo. I'll see you at that party.  I'll see you there?
Don't hold it against him. He just never got Caitlin out of his system. It's not your fault. It's Dante.  I don't know thing one about chicks. Do you want to cry or something? I can leave.
Um, do you think you can give me a lift home tonight?
Man! I hate it when I can't rent videos!
Which one?
That woulda been cool.
Nothing, just tourist souvenirs.
More bang for the buck.
They're about two hundred yards from the top of the tower, right where that ledge comes out, Gabe.
I copy.
What usually eats a banana?
It can't fly in this weather.
I need my bolt gun and an ice axe.
I want the money--meet me at the highest point from where you are. Don't do it and we're going to see if your angel here can fly. Copy?
You're getting warmer!
I'm here for the same reason you are, so let's do it.
There wasn't time for anything else.
If you want, do it.  I don't care.
Fine, I guess...
Is it really four thousand?
Okay--I don't know about this.
Just keep lookin' at me and only think about the distance <u>across</u>. Count it as you go:  One, two...by eight you'll be there.
One...
We spent a night there one night...
I can't blame anything on Hal. It was me.  I play it back in my mind everyday.
I don't expect you to understand.
You couldn't.
I can't.  Not here.  If you want, I'd like you to come with me...somewhere else.
He doesn't want my help.
You got to go back now!
For the same reason you did, to help.
Excuse me?
Call me sentimental.
Of course I do.
You attacked me.
I don't know.  Here, lay down and get some rest.  We're going to need it.
Next time, date only basketball players.
Jess, c'mon...
I won't do it.  No way.
Gabe?  Wait 'til I get over there.  Tie the rope so I can come across.
Never could save a thing.
What the hell's going on?
How far?
There.  You blind?
Who's going with you?
Then it's a deal.
Somehow I didn't think you'd wait for me if I'd sent it first.
There, what's that place?
We agree on something.  And for insurance, take his coat.
Kill him when he gets down.
We can't and he knows it.
Insurance against him finding that last case ahead of us.
I told you, 50,000 possible keycode combinations, in fifteen second intervals.
You're the boss.  Let's head out to the tarmac.  Matheson, have you been totally briefed?
For being a bastard with no manners and not a dook of an idea how to comport yourself publicwise, O my Brother.
Welly, welly, welly, welly, welly, welly, well. To what do I owe the extreme pleasure of this surprising visit? Georgie rises.
I just don't get this all. It was them that went for me, brothers. You're not on their side and can't be. You can't be Dim. It was someone we fillied with back in the old days... Trying to get his own malenky bit of revenge after all this time. You remember, Dim?
The police... The horrible ghastly Police. They beat me up, sir. The Police beat me up, sir. Mr. Alexander stares at him. It becomes apparent he is insane.
Won't you join me, sir?
Phoned some friends, sir?
I'm frightfully sorry. There is a telephone in the Public House about a mile down the road. I suggest you use that.
Now listen here, you little bastard, just you turn around and walk out of here the same way as you came in. Alex eyes a giant white, fibreglass phallic sculpture on the table beside him.
I understand that you had a rather unfortunate encounter with the Police tonight.
Hahaha, and how are you feeling now?
Well, shall we get down to it?
Bit of pain in the gulliver, Mum. Leave us be and I'll try to sleep it off... then I'll be as right as dodgers for this after.
I've got to rest, Mum... got to get fit, otherwise I'm liable to miss a lot more school.
To what do I owe this extreme pleasure, sir? Anything wrong, sir? Deltoid "playfully" grabs Alex's hair.
Well, er, I think that was something that they hadn't planned for, you see, Missus, I'm very fond of music and always have been, especially Beethoven, Ludwig van... Beethoven. B... E... E... He leans over and looks at her writing in notebook.
That's right. Er... I can't listen to the 9th any more at all. When I hear the 9th, I get like this funny feeling.
New way? What's this about a new way? There's been some very large talk behind my sleeping back, and no error. Let me hear more.
Brother, you think and talk sometimes like a little child. Tonight we pull a mansize crast.
Oh, the old moloko-plus first, would you not say
Thank you very much. Thank you my dear. Girl bows and exits to loud applause.
Yes... well good to see you on the mend. I've kept in constant touch with the hospital, of course, and now I've come to see you personally to see how you're getting along.
Well - I'm back.
Aye, that's Joe. He... ummmm, lives here now. The lodger. That's what he is... he... he rents your room. Alex confronts Joe.
Oh well, he met with like an accident. He passed away. Alex becomes a bit weepy.
Sorry, brother. I didn't mean any offence.
Right. Sign here for your valuable property. Alex signs.
Now then, were you in Police custody this morning?
Yes, sir, Church of England, sir.
No, sir.
Vitamins will it be then?
Yes!!!
Oh.
It's not that kind of a test. But you seem well on the way to a complete recovery.
I never forget a face! I never forget any face, be God!
Indeed.
The question is weather or not this technique really makes a man good. Goodness comes from within. Goodness is chosen. When a man cannot chose, he ceases to be a man.
Be patient, my son, and put your trust in the Lord.
Now then. Face the wall. Bend over and touch your toes. Chief Guard inspects Alex's anus with a penlight.
Leave to carry on, sir, please?
You are to be reformed. Tomorrow you go to this man, Brodsky. You wbe leaving here. You will be transferred to the Ludovico Medical Facility. It is believed that you will be able to leave State custody in a little over a fortnight. I suppose that prospect pleases you?
Would you like me to make you a nice cup of tea, son?
I agree, sir. What we need are larger prisons. More money.
No, no, no. That's enough. He's perfect. I want his records sent to me. This vicious young hoodlum will be transformed out of all recognition.
Sixth is a parking lot north of 23rd this time of day.
You psychic?
He's...what?  Say again?  We're in cell hell...
Save me the grief.  Step out of the car, sir, and open the trunk.
Jesus...
Was it great?  Better than great, it had to be...
I never lie.  Ask Max.  Max, have I lied yet?
Of course.
Very generous.
...Petrov and Cicerno for sure...
Ivan Petrov.  Supposed to meet me for dinner, never shows up.  I come here, find this.
Months now.  He's been feeding me information on Dmitri.
What thing?
Jesus.  Two in one night?
Tell my son.  You have to hold a gun to his head to get him to come see me.
Of course I'm proud.  You know he started with nothing?  Look at him today.  Playing concerts.
Try?
You couldn't pick up a phone?  I'm lying here, wondering if something horrible happened...
What happens if you don't?
Jesus, what is with this guy?
Max!  Dammit!  <u>Answer!</u>
Yeah, yeah, sorry...
You mean like benefits?
Me, specifically?
Last thing I need is a reason to keep hacking.  This job's a fill-in.
I'm not a hire car.  It's against regs?
You always stutter?
No-no, I-I shot him.  The bullets and the fall killed him.
I tried it.
I told you we had other stops to make tonight.
You don't know the guy in the trunk, either.  If it makes you feel better, he was a villain involved in a Continuing Criminal Enterprise.
Then don't let me get cornered, Max. You don't have the trunk space.
Good luck.  You think they got families?
I can't do that.  He's the Man.  He'll fire my ass.
Tell him next time he pulls any shit, you're gonna kick his fat ass.
Yeah.
I don't understand...
I'm...what?  Sorry?
I listen to classical.
You mind?  I'm working here.
No.
<u>I don't wanna know you!</u>
There's no way I'm taking you to see my mother!
Jazz.
Fuck!  Nothing's ever goddamn good enough!  It's always been that way.
I've always been good.  Ever since I started.  Gave up piano.  Easy money. I'm putting a stake together, get something started.  Go figure it all out...
He's gonna <u>shoot</u> me?
That cop!  Why'd you have to do that?  You couldn't wound him?  The guy had a family, maybe, parents, kids who gotta grow up without a dad, he was probably a good guy; and he believed me...
Some living.
Whyn't you kill me and find another cab.
That's what you said...
What'd they do?
None of your business.
But you know what?  Nothing matters, anyway.  We are insignificant out here in the big nowhere, say the badass sociopath in my backseat.  Right? Yeah.  That's one thing I've got to thank you for, bro.  And I never saw it that way...
Any special reason?
Geronimo?
I love her so bad.  She just... wrecks me.  I would die for her.
Water mains usually go in the winter.  It's August 1st.
Flip was a hero in Vietnam.
Come on!  Six major earthquakes in the last three years?  The space shuttle in orbit for every one of them?
So why do you keep the picture up? You wish you hadn't quit?
I got to get downstairs.  The C.I.A., they want to see your body.
<u>Heart attacks happen</u>.
Them who?
As opposed to?
You mean I should speed up and try and lose them?
Yeah.  I think so.
I'm not sure.  I think I figured something out.  It must've been in my newsletter.
Uh huh.
Not this again.
Where'd you get your subscribers?
They're dead.  Four out of five anyhow.  All in the last 24 hours. One car accident, two heart attacks and a stroke.
There are all kinds of groups, all kinds of initials.  But they're all part of two warring factions. One:  families that have held wealth for centuries. They want one thing.  Stability. Group Two:  the boat rockers. Eisenhower's military industrial complex.  They want instability. It's a trillion dollar a year business.  When there isn't a hot war, they make a cold one.
So now they feed us terrorists. <u>To create fear</u>.  How much do you think an airport security system goes for?  Then multiply it by every airport in the country.
Latest casualty?  Ernest Harriman. You heard of him?
Okay, I will.
Those are song lyrics, Jerry.
No.  That wouldn't be fair.  Where are we going, Jerry?
Not today.
What's in Connecticut?
He gave it to me.
Where were you the day he died?
That's the last time you rode, isn't it?  Do you think it was your fault?  Is that why?
To Jonas.  I didn't know that at the time.  Didn't know who he was.  But I knew inside, whoever he was, he'd send someone else.  So I started watching your father.  I wanted to keep him safe.
Walters was their fall guy.  Blow up a building and blame a nut. Create fear.  Don't you see?  Your father wasn't trying to keep Walters in prison.  He was looking into getting him out.  He didn't believe the official story.
Your father, he was dying.  He was worried about you.  He took your picture out to look at it.  He called you his baby.
It's okay.  You...  You thought I was bad.
Where are you?
It's up.  Love gives you wings. You can fly away from here.
That's ironic.  Because we're here to protect her from you.
Well, I don't know if --
You've asked me that one three times.
Excuse me?
Fine.  What the hell is going on?
Missionary?  Penance?  You talk about it like it was a religion.
Working.
What do I look like to you? Switzerland?
I don't know if you're the best lawyer I've got or a high school sophomore.
This doesn't make sense.
I don't like it.  Something's wrong.
What the hell does that mean?
You don't understand --
Wasn't my idea.
And Jonas?
I'm going to find him.  Because he'd find me.
Yes, sir.
All the elements are there.  A woman, orphaned young, under a great deal of stress.  The failure of a project she's staked her self-worth and very sense of identity on -- induces a fantasy of reuniting with her 'father in heaven' as it were. Is it possible?
Okay, fine, they've got the primes -- but if you're right about there being another more significant transmission still to come --
How is that possible?  How could all that information be encoded in --
Dr. Drumlin, we are talking about what could potentially be the most important discovery in the history of humanity.  There are over four hundred billion stars out there --
Oh?  How's he doing?
Really?  Congratulations, by the way.
No doubt.
Did I tell you we've expanded the search spectrum?  We're including several other possible magic frequencies -- not just the hydrogen line anymore.  I was trying to get inside their heads, y'know?  And I started thinking, what other constants are there in the Universe besides hydrogen, and then suddenly it was so obvious -- transcendantals, right?  So we've been trying variations of pi...
I'm going to convert Mr. Science-is- the-root-of-all-evil?  This is absurd, David.  We have work to do here, I don't have time to play babysitter to the God Squad.
Interesting analogy.  And how guilty would we feel if we happened to destroy some microbes on a beach in Africa?
Ellie.
Actually I'm running late --
A transport.  So are they coming or are we going?
Yes -- of course -- all I'm saying is, this message was written in the language of science -- mathematics -- and was clearly intended to be received by scientists.  If it had been religious in nature it should have taken the form of a burning bush, or a booming voice from the sky...
Well --
No primer.
This is how you see the sky?
Thank you, Mr. Sensitive.  I'm coming at this wrong... missing something... something...
It's a civilian facility.
It's incredibly rich.  We've been cataloging it in frames or 'pages'; right now we're on 10,413.
And current theory holds that to sustain the sort of wormholes you're talking about, even for a fraction of a second, would require more energy than our sun produces in a year, is that correct?
In fact, by all the laws of physics we know what you claim to have experienced is simply impossible.
-- but I don't believe it to be the truth.
Because I can't.
I can't move any smaller.
But what do I say?
Big enough radio, I don't see why not.
Mmm, that's a good one.  Maybe his echo...  Okay, no more stalling.
Okay.
Oh, we didn't build it.  The transit system has been in place for billions of years; we're just its... caretakers.
You always have been.  We're all descendants of the same stars, Ellie.  All made of the same primordial atoms.
But -- other people from our planet should see what I've seen -- they should witness this for themselves.
I find it convenient to keep my interests... mobile.  Anyway, I've had my fill of life on the ground. After spending much of this century pursuing the evils and pleasures the world has to offer -- after outliving three wives and two children...  I find I've had quite enough of planet Earth.
Oh, maybe not out -- but definitely looking for you coat.  I understand you've had some difficulty locating the -- what are you calling it?  The 'primer' that will make decryption possible...  I've found it.
I've had a long time to make enemies, Dr. Arroway.  There are many governments, business interests, even religious leaders who would like to see me disappear. And I will grant them their wish soon enough... But before I do, I wish to make a small contribution -- a final gesture of goodwill toward the people of this little planet who've given -- from whom I've taken so much.
That would seem to be the question of the hour.  I want to build it, Doctor.  Of course I'm already lobbying through the usual channels of influence and corruption -- but as I said, my colorful past has made many of those channels... difficult to navigate. I need someone on the inside.
Oh, not quite yet.  At least for their sake...  ... I hope it's not.  Because they're running out of time.
I think whoever sent the message did it because they're worried about us.
Perhaps.  But on the off-chance that it is a 'doomsday device' of some kind, I plan to be very far away from your lovely Texas when it is activated.
That's what they all say.
And?
Ellie... even if you do manage to raise the money, have you thought about what it would really mean to follow through on this?  I mean a college fetish is one thing, but we're talking about your career. You won't be publishing.  You won't be taken seriously... and you could spend your entire life looking and never find anything at all.
I'm going on staff at the N.S.F.  To work for Drumlin.
Jesus --
Like it or not.
Make that two.
I'd say logic more than faith.  The odds were on my side.
I guess I would've felt sorry for the universe.
Please --
I'm not sure it's come to that.
Ellie... if you go out there like this -- if you admit to even the possibility that what you experienced didn't actually happen -- I'm afraid they really will crucify you.  Please.  For your own sake, for the sake of the world... tell them what you know to be the truth.  Tell them it really happened.
Does that mean you think it doesn't exist?
Meaning...
Git your shovel and git to work.
We work down in the ditch?
I'll make it a dollar.
We allus thought you was strong enough to carry it. Was we wrong?
Nothin'. Ever'thing's cool's can be.
Yeah.
Ram it in and break it off!
I... I... I...
I know, I know. Just don't hit me.
Yeah, they sure do make a lot of cold, hard, noise, Captain.
Fasten your flap! All you Newmeats gonna have to shape up fast and hard on this gang. We got rules here an' in order to learn them, you gotta keep your ears open and your mouths shut.
I did three hitches in the Navy. It ain't bad. After a while, you get used to it and the time --
Borrowin'.
Wouldn't surprise me none.  Wicker Man says you got a hundred- twenny and some change in the Captain's safe and you got your five dollars pocket money... That'll buy you a whole fistfull of cards. You in or out?
I got eyes, don't I? How my not gonna see something like that?
He's been betting his head from the gun. Gotta have kings.
Yeah, those poor old guards need all the help they can get.
But damn if he don't look like a fat old Dragline.
Nuthin' can be a pretty cool hand.
Fifty's a nice round number.
You ol' sack of guts. I had a belly like yours, we wouldn't have nothin' to worry about.
Oh, that's mah darlin' Luke. Grins like a baby and bites like a 'gator.
We ain't goin' nowhere.
Luke, are you alright?... They got us, boy. They're out there thicker'n flies. Bosses and dogs and sheriffs and more guns than I ever seen in my life. We don't have a chance, Luke... They caught up with me right after we split up and they was aimin' to kill you, Luke. But I got 'em to promise if you give up peaceful, they wouldn't even whip you this time.
Thass right. Just play it...
Dear Boys. Playing it cool. Wish you were here. Love, Cool Hand Luke.
Ace calls. Here we go.  King-five gets a tray for no help.  Paira ninas gets a Jack.  Ana man with the ace gets... slop in the face... Ninas up.
I know he's got a paira kings. He don't have to stick 'em in my ear.
You can't expect him to learn everything the first day. Hopefully it's taught him a very valuable lesson.
None of your fucking business.
Fear of what...
When was the last time you washed your hair?
Oh my God!  Help!  HE'S READING A NEWSPAPER!
Okay.  You win.  'Dirty Harry' coming up.
Then, why don't you just die.  I'm going.  They'll find your body years later, the old recluse lady, she ate cat food, ten years of the New York Times, unread, piled on top of the unread mail, the TV still on.  Make up your mind.  Live or die.  I'll get coffee.
Hal has it.
Only part.  What else?  What did you think of his claim that he tied this girl to the tree and set fire to her because Joan of Arc told him to do it.
'Lying.  He was lying.'  I asked you what you thought, not what he did.
When was that?
And you believed him when he told you he had done that.
Cut the crap.  You got a sheet the length of my arm...
Shut up -- I'm talking.  You got felony breaking and entering, burglary, felonious...
You were going to make a delivery to Peter Kurten for Daryll Lee Cullum.  I want Kurten's phone number.
What Friday?
I'm trying to tell you.  It's on the lady's pillow...
Bet you never figured I'd follow in your footsteps.  It's real well- written.  You should read it -- you're in it.
Something personal.  Is he bothering you?
Damn!  I gave that to Conrad, too! That guy!  I told Conrad deliver to Kurten and keep the 500 bucks in return for getting my book to you.
You know where.
You're calling me a crank?
I think this is number three...
What calls?  I haven't made any calls.
Oh, my God, no!  I'm a clinical hysteric, with panic syndrome, and anxiety neurosis, agoraphobic, I'm afraid of everything, real and imaginary.  I never leave this apartment now.  Nobody ever comes here.  I just wanted to get your attention.  I write and I used to lecture on these crimes, but... I'm not competent.
I don't look at pictures.  I look at the <u>real thing</u>.  I don't feel infected.
I just came from her... here's what you haven't seen.
Nobody knows you have anything to do with this case; nothing has been on TV or the news... Why would he want to get in <u>your</u> computer?
I turned it off.  It's like an open window he can climb right in...
Look in the crowd.  He liked to hang around and watch the cops at work...
He said to send you his regards and to tell you that the Bureau holds you in the highest esteem.
It's also the major piece of evidence, and it makes you a key part of his plan.  You can't run away from it anymore.  Look at the order he's doing them... He did three as the Boston Strangler just to tell us a copycat serial killer was at work.  Then he did one like the Hillside Strang- ler.  And then one as Son of Sam. To lead us on -- to where and what end?  And he's doing more than that -- he's imitating each killer's method as closely as he can -- in details.  Injecting Windex.  Using .44.  Playing Abba.
He felt sorry for me.  It was so nice to flirt.  He was a darling man.
You're exhausted.  Let me get you a brandy.
I'm working on it!  It's what I do.  Quinn...Halloran.  I'll wait.  Where's Andy, can we get some coffee in here?
W-We had a fight.  I called him... called him a name...
He hasn't done Bundy.  He's done every one of the others, hasn't he? If there are three dead Chi Omega college girls tomorrow, how will you feel?  Go there.  See if there could be any way for him to escape.
If there's a one percent possibil- ity, can you live with yourself when he kills again?
He's hacked into her Internet address.  He's a hacker.
Not yet.
No.  I'm shy and I'm selective.
Well.  Another time, then.  I'll be all right.  He's not going to attack me; what I' m rally afraid of is all in my own head, Ruben.
<u>What</u>?...
Why don't you shoot off the lock?
I know, baby.  I know.
Quinn decided we should form a task force -- they're all one case, now. He wants all the senior detectives on it...  She wasn't killed here.
You're right.  I can't stand that bastard.  Sorry.  This is something new.  Not the same guy, that's for sure.
Look at him, grandstanding...
Excuse me?  <u>Excuse me</u>?!  What do you...
Good.
The same as the firs two. Definitely a serial.
Anybody in this department ever worked a serial killer case?  She's the expert.  I need help.
Yessir.  I have reflected on that, sir.  Which explains my gushing deference to you, sir.
Who've I got to beat up except the messenger?  Does this give us anything to go on?
Give me Ruben back...
What's going down with the sting in Chinatown?  That gonna be off your plate in a week or what?
No. What about your camera girl? Did she come?
They consider this to be the airport hospital. This ward is reserved for air- crash victims. The beds are kept waiting.
Outside in the visitors, car park.
The sergeant asked me to identify it. He didn't believe you'd gotten out alive.
I can't sit on this balcony forever. I'm beginning to feel like a potted plant.
Were you badly hurt? I think we saw each other at the hospital.  I don't want the car. In fact, I was appalled to find that I have to pay a small fee to have it scrapped.
I work in the immigration department there.
Yes.
No.
Hard to say.
It's not the police. It's the Department of Transport. Internal politics. It's a joke. They have no idea who we really are
You're right, Ballard. There's an all- night car-wash in the airport service area.
Where are you?
Well, I don't have hallucinations. Honest.
What?
I apologize for the inconvenience, but I must ask you some...
I miss Beast a lot, too.
What about Michael? Do you know the extent of his...
Then that's even more reason to listen. Look, schizophrenics tend to withdraw from reality. They experience emotional disturbances that result in personality changes. 
Drugs can help suppress symptoms. But lots of patients stop taking them when they're on their own because the side effects are so harsh.  And, Michael's condition is often worsened by periods of stress. He's been in and out of...
All I want you to do is think about what's best for you. Really think about it.
I have a going-away gesture for you, too.
Well, my theory is that people can really enjoy math, but they lose interest...
I'd have to see it on.
But everything's OK?
Look, Mom, I think I've found the dress.
Do you think I should?
What's the matter?
No, no. They've got to be Puglia olives, packed in a light brine with a flavor that doesn't overpower the palate.
I can hardly wait 'til you're free. Planning the wedding without you has been a disaster.
Come on.
Especially with a promotion in the offing.
I just want to go home.   Can we go home now?
Tomorrow?
Just eat whatever you want. This will give you a chance to meet some people.
I'm glad.
Terrific.
That must be really difficult.
You took bets on my diagnosis?
I've already checked it out 17 times.
I won't do your portion of kitchen cleanup.
No rounds for another three hours.
What are the delusions like?
Tell the doctor.
Home free.
You like it?
Do you like it?
Shhhh.
I'll be forced to tickle you.
I'll see you tonight.
Thanks.
Sounds grim.
It doesn't matter.    It'll work out.
You got wine. That's great.
The restaurant, too?
You don't have to take care of me, you know.
I think you know I'd love you even more in a blue polyester cap.
I saw you talking to my Mom.
Michael, calm down. Please. It's OK.
Letty, please.
What do you want to do?
I love you too, Letty.     I love you, too.
Good going. I knew you could do it.
Come on, Letty.   It'll get done.
Of course it will. Remember the big talent show you planned last year? And what about the Christmas benefit when Santa canceled at the last minute? But you still pulled it off.
Can you loan me a 20?
I'm going to the store.
That's a big question.
So, I've been thinking a lot...
Or be up past ten or fraternize with other patients.
No...
I've met someone else.
I love him.
Oh.
I do apologize.    A student had a crisis.
What does that mean?
You killed her!
Bullshit! She was alive when we left her with you.
A pass? How you gonna give me a pass? A witness can put me at the crime scene.
Yes I did.    Lose ends are messy.
You're calling me on is phone?
-- I've got the tapes. If you ever want to see your brother out of jail do exactly what I say. Bring one million euros to your boat at six o'clock.
Well, you better get the money somehow. Six o'clock and come alone. If you don't we'll destroy the tapes.
No thank you.
I'm good.   Really.
Yeah. That warehouse over on Merchant Street. The volume on our import business has risen dramatically. The proceeds this quarter will be supernumerary due to the --
Supernumerary. It means better than expected.
Supernumerary. It means better than expected.
He missed three weeks.
Yes.
I guess we're going to find out.
You want me to help you get out of the country?
I'll destroy them when we get back to Paris.
Thank you.
If you think because you're a women this can't go hard on you, think again.
Laurant and Vincent were in business with Zammito.
We can't.
We're leaving. Raymond get the bag.
What about the money?
And the Vodka.
Do I?
That's Frankie Zammito.   The Under boss of the Chicago Mafia.
You didn't think it was little suspicious that someone you only knew for a few hours wanted to sleep with you?
Yeah, I'd be from Belgium too if I was you. You know Zammito just put his own brother in the hospital? Broke his arm cause he was late on a debt. I mention this to illustrate the kind of people who are lookin' for you.
Fine.
Hector, don't interrupt me.
What'd they take?
Well, I must say you're handling it very well.
Okay boss.   Where are they?
You didn't say find them. You said, "get them."
Good song though.
Dead bodies. The ones in the Lincoln are your... associates.
A Wallet.    A hotel room card.    Some cash.
Oh, then we will have the house wine.
Bastaldi got the address from you, yes?
And he gave it to us.    145 Ridgeway Road.
What is it you do, Sami?
I see.   A master criminal.
Okay.    I will have a beer.
C'mon, get real, will you. You think he's just going to forget about this? These guys are all about respect. All about honor. He's coming after us, so we might as well take the money.
This wasn't the deal! The deal was to steal a necklace, not get in the middle of a Mafia war.
We've got to get out of here.
She took everything!    Didn't even leave us cab fare.
I'm the driver.
What the hell is he talking about?
What are we going to do, take a taxi?
It's my idea.

Whatever! He never told me about the Van Gogh or any of the other paintings.
No.
No!
He's over at St. James. They had to put two pins in his arm.
The hell it is.
Cool.
Oh, you think?
Wait here.
Julien, what you're doing right now is a very normal psychological reaction to stress. You're projecting your anger onto us.
Glenmorangie.
Just lucky I guess. How'd you start working for the Bastaldi's?
I don't remember.    I was drunk.
No.
I thought I'd listen to some of the tapes. See what's so important that a mob guy has to lock it away in his safe.
It's three in the morning.    Not much else to do.
Stick around and find out.
Vincent Bastaldi is in jail.
You broke my arm. How the hell do you think I'm doin'?
Yeah. I'm going home today.    What do you want, Frankie?
You gonna forget about the money I owe you?
A car.
I didn't have the heart.
Then leave her to me.
I do as I please.
What's it to you?
That's a risk I'm willing to take. Deep down, you're good.  Even Jade Fox couldn't corrupt you.
I'll never live as a thief!
Don't bother.
I've made you silk pajamas.  Do you want to change into them?
The handle is heavy.  And the blade is no ordinary metal.  Still, the sword is the lightest of weapons. You're just not used to handling it.
My friend Li Mu Bai.  He's given it to Sir Te as a gift.
Really?
Writers wouldn't sell many books if they told how it really is.
I am not an aristocrat, as you are... but I must still respect a woman's duties.
Go back to them first.  Then you can decide about Lo.
Li Mu Bai has made arrangements. He sent him to Wudan Mountain.
Don't be a sore loser.  Go ahead. Take your pick.  I'll wait.  Go ahead.
Then you have no use for the sword.
My comb!
So you're still that little boy looking for shooting stars.
It has.  How's business?
Is there any place safer than under the nose of Governor Yu?
Be careful.  Sir Te requires discretion.  Official business is difficult enough.  Don't let personal feelings make it worse. And I don't know... even this poster... could be some sort of trap.
But Wudan does not accept women.
Not everything is an illusion.  My hand... wasn't that real?
Not a bad idea.  Tonight we'll get a good night's sleep at headquarters.
That can't be!  Everything has an antithesis!  Why not this?
Shu Lien...
But don't be too lenient.
Li Mu Bai giving up his sword and his warrior days... maybe he's trying to tell you something?
What do you have in mind?
I call it blood, Detective.  If you want, you can call it graffiti.
Care for a hot dog?
Don't thank me.
No further.  I'm serious.
I need you to tell me what you remember.  What happened to us?
My pleasure. ERIC Don't smoke these.
It's only a flesh wound.
He was a present.  Besides, we're moving anyway.  You said.
It can't rain all the time.
Out.  Now.  I gotta work.
A remembrance.  A closure.
She's still dead.
I don't know you...
Five large, in the drawer right over there.  I never saw you.
I can see her.
Your pain ends now.
Interested?  Follow the crow.
Fine with me.
I'm already alone.
18k.  Crap.
This is a cobra, Mr. Grange.  Yes, it is real.
Extremely so.  You and I are the recipients of unwanted good fortune, in the form of a man everyone is calling The Crow.
I intend no slight to you, but I cannot find the English to adequately express just what he is.  I suppose Western mythology would describe him as a Fury.
Like some sort of zombie on a revenge trip.
Bad news.  Alot of action on the streets tonight, and nobody bothered to clear it with me.  Tin- Tin got himself whacked.
One of mine.  And it wasn't a standard hit.
I was wondering if you could tell me anything... about a wildcat operative.
Who the hell do you think you are coming into my house and saying those things to me. My brother is dead, have some respect.
I don't know. Relationships seem too distracting. I'd rather concentrate on my studies.
You did?
I wasn't knocking anything. It's just my belief that people shouldn't actually experience the act of love until they are in love and that people our age are too immature to be in touch with those emotions.
A friend wrote me.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you... but you still didn't answer the question.
Why don't you come join me for a swim and we'll discuss it.
Please.
What? Another letter from your friend?
You know you could at least have the decency of telling me who's badmouthing me so I might have the opportunity to confront them face to face. How do you know it's not some girl who's pissed off at me for breaking up with her?
Is that the last thing you need? My your clever.
I wasn't kidding. I'd like to take you out.
No thank you.
Give it up.
I'm not going to speak to you till you realize that you can't intimidate me.
Well try this one on for size. I think I'm falling in love with you.
What?
It's not about being happy. You and I can't -
Well, I was just calling to see how you're doing.
How was your date?
Yeah, it's pretty relevant considering my situation.
I will.
I'm doing some volunteer work.
Oh please.
"I actually feel good about myself?"
Who's Monsieur Philipe?
I thought you said we were going to be friends.
That's not fair.
Where are you going?
It was perfect.
What are you saying?
I love you.
What, your virginity? Well that's over now.
Cecile, is that the best you can do?  You must forgive her, Kathryn. She's never been in a co-educational atmosphere before.
Don't you raise your voice at me. Go to your room, now.
Well hurry up. I want to be at Mrs. Rosemond's before lunch.
You think so? I don't know. I guess I'm just scared.
No.
If she knew, she'd kill me. It happened at your house last night.
Well... not exactly.
Well did you like it?
I did?
How are things down under? Blossoming I hope.
I want to go home.
You promised to let me kiss you.
I do.
Same time next week?
Don't be insecure, Doc. You're a big help.
It works a little.
Get out of here.
I told you to lock the door.
Please don't tell anyone. This could ruin my career.
Did you do everything I asked you to?
Who is this?
Likewise I'm sure.
Ronald?
It's Sebastian. He's out of his mind.
That was just simple revenge. What I have planned requires sheer genius.
Shut up and turn to page 64.
Care to make a wager on that?
If you lose, then that hot little Porsche of yours is mine.
Blow me.
Have you succeeded in your task?
Well, let me know when you do. Until then.
Eat me, Sebastian. It's alright for you to fuck everyone, but because I'm a girl it's wrong. Well let me tell you something, I didn't ask to be a girl. Do you think I relish the fact that I have to act like Mary Sunshine twenty four seven, so I can be considered a "laaaady." Do you think I take great delight when I hear - "Kathryn is so wonderful." "Kathryn is a model child." "Kathryn is going to make an excellent wife one day."  I'm the Marsha fucking Brady of the upper East Side and sometimes I want to kill myself for it. No, I don't enjoy being a part of the weaker sex and for that reason everyone around me is going to suffer. So there's your psychoanalysis Doctor Freud. Now are you in or are you out?
Yippy.
Morning.
With who?
It was... Fantastic.
Excuse me?
And that's why you're leaving?
Kathryn, you know I love you. I've always loved you.
Thank you. Now, where were we?
How do you do it? I mean with all peer pressuring that goes on in high school. Where do you get your strength?
I hope I didn't keep you from something.
Well... you promise you won't say anything to her. We've developed a friendship and...
You will be discreet about this?
Whatever. You are never to set foot in this house again and you are never and I mean never to see my daughter again. Is that understood?!
Fine. Could you please see that she gets this.
Excuse me?
Nope.
How will I get to her?
Hello. I just met Amy and she pointed out where you live.
No. I only let her go with Edward.  It's alright.
It's one of the clearest memories I have. Twelfth night...burning pine... and mummers' plays.
That's what I wished on. Edward says it's a wishing ring -- and it is!
Are they nice?
All right, Amy.  Go tell Edward to take you.
She's not Irena's child -- there's nothing of Irena in her. She's my child.
I'm not a jealous woman, Oliver.
But they must have.  Amy and I made them out together.  You mailed them, didn't you, Edward?
What?
But you told me in the garden-- that the wish about the tree couldn't come true.
They ran away.
This one says, "To Mother from Amy."
And this one's for Mrs. Farren.
But there's no one here, darling.
Yes, darling.
Whenever you want.
It reminded me of you, so I bought it. It cost me more than all the others.
Oh, please!
Because it knows it can move with the swiftness of strong wind.
It is wildness and freedom. No one can touch it.
I do suppose so. But if you were there yesterday, guess you can get there today.
But what happened to the little deer?
But it was alive - it was fast and strong!
Who is she?
A Christmas present. It's been so long since I've had a Christmas present.
Look at me.
Yes, Barbara... Barbara...
Come away, Amy.
I don't believe in PMS. Women made it up just so they can be bitchy.
James Dean, Humphrey Bogart...
Never felt better.
It's hard to describe. I get really bloated and irritable and emotional and depressed and...
Nearly four.
Does she have PMS?
Well that's not going to happen tonight. George said Carlton's a nice guy.
Every woman at some point has to date a musician. I wish you'd get rid of Mark for good. Every time you break up you see him more than when you were going out.
Maybe he's just shy.
I get a little bloated sometimes.
What do I need overpriced fancy underwear for? Shouldn't a guy have already decided that he likes me before he sees me in lingerie?
What a bitch. You should see a doctor. That can be dangerous. George bit me once and I had to go to the emergency room.
I kind of asked him to. We were, you know... he got a little carried away...
Maybe he likes you, ever think of that? It's good for you to go out -- get your mind off Mark.
They better. Of course, trouble is, you never know what they'll expect for it. You gotta know what to order, and what you're willing to do. Like if a guy spends a fortune on you, he's gonna feel like you owe him something.
There you go, blaming yourself for everything again.
Did I kill him? Of course not!
No you don't, believe me.
No they're not.
There is a man's arm in my bed.
Frida, you're not making sense. I can't come over right now.
It took me an hour to clean it up. That was not in my head!
Did you get rid of Mark?
Check out what I found.
Great so all I have to do is fall in love? Like I haven't tried that for the past 24 years.
You'll get through this. You were fine for over three weeks.
Frida? You okay?
Well, whattdaya think?
You never say that.
You haven't even paid me back the thousand bucks you owe me!
It's Mark.
On your desk.
Did you change your hair?
Yes, that's what we're looking for.
I'll make a note of that. Put the coverage on my desk.
Very well then. Is that all?
Okay, if you think of anything else, please give us a call.
At least let me give you this back. I washed it.
I'm trying to stay away from caffeine.
No. Really. I don't drink coffee anymore. I used to love it but my tastes have changed recently.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry Peter. Gee, that sure puts my problems in perspective.
Oh, nothing's wrong. Just... well don't you have your period?
No. No, I'm fine. Maybe I should go. I mean... I don't want our first time to be like this.
NO! I... I checked when I put my stuff in. I always look through the washer first.
A man killed in Central Park.
Frida, can we come in? We need to talk to you. It's important.
Yeah sort of. Where's Lloyd?
No, my bite's a lot worse.
No. But I don't mind hairy. Are you okay?
You want the truth? Remember I tried to tell you something the other day?
Thanks.
We didn't have sex.
Looks like it was your only date. Unless you go to his funeral.
Packages of money.
Tell her I'm eating.
Don't be stupid George. Obviously if she's a werewolf, she can't be around a cat. She might eat it and besides, cats are afraid of wolves.
We can just take this pillowcase.
That dude was torn limb from limb. No way a woman like that could have done it. You never seen blood on a chick's sheets from her period?
I told you she was innocent.
Waiting for DNA tests. He was hairier than Madonna in Penthouse.
And he was missing an arm.
Like a vampire or some shit?
Hard to tell. Looks like he's been cleaned up and he's decomposing as we speak. This case gets weirder by the minute.
I know. I followed you. To the zoo, to her house, to your house...
Which brings up an interesting point. I wasn't following you. I was following the suspect. And you just happened to be there...
And that was 28 days ago today.
Looks like you need a haircut to me.
You wouldn't believe me if I told you, Inspector.  Have patience  - you'll see for yourself.
What makes you think that!  If you would learn to concentrate on facts, not get so side-tracked  -  you might get things done faster, Bumstead...
Well.  The only thing I've been certain of, all this time, is that I need to get to the ocean.  The point is no one seems to know how to get there.
I'm on the serial killer case, need to talk.
No...  No doctor...
No.  Have a look.
Everyone has a job  -  a function.  Each one teaches you more about your invention.  I'm what is called a <u>murderer</u>.
Wait, this isn't fair...
Waves...  A beach.  A woman whispering.  That's all.  I need to stay awake.  Do you have any pills?
Asks my name.  Over and over.  Just like a broken record.  Only thing is, I can't answer.  I've no idea what my name <u>is</u>.
You're supposed to be my doctor, right?
Well...
Don't ask stupid questions.  Look at it.
That's easy.  You...
What?
No more than the usual.
We'll be back for you first thing tomorrow and if you need me for anything, Duane will be right outside the door.
Don't worry about it.
I promise.  I won't.
What the hell is this ?
) Listen, you little...
Yes, Bob.   Choices... Now the Commerce Department..,
You mean the press conference?  I have a couple of ideas I wanted to share with the country.
Like how?
Mild stroke?
Up and around?  Soon?
What about her.
And...
Clean.
I'm telling you, Bob,  it's a gift. When you got a Ferrari you don't leave it in the garage.
Just what you think I mean.
... But as I began to investigate, I realized that this pattern of corruption extended much higher...
Dave -- I'm working.
This is undeclared income.
It's alright.  I know what you mean. Let's start at the top.
I know...  I know...  It's difficult for all of us.  But sometimes we have to put our personal feelings aside and focus on the gQod of the country.
Right.  Now whenever he stands at a Podium, the President always puts one hand in the pocket of his coat...
'America isn't in what we say here tonight -- it's in the faces and the smiles of a Sunday afternoon...'  Hand on the heart...
But we went there.  We saw those kids.
He's not.
Why?
Oh, come on, we're not children.  I didn't have anything to do with this Fidelity nonsense and you know it.
He's not gonna win -- not in the end... They never do.
Yeah... Sometimes they do.
I can't say.
No.
No... They don't kid.
The Vice-President...
Thanks for doing this, Ellen?
Since when do you care about the homeless?
Yeah.  I'm sure it's keeping you up nights.
Oh, come on, Bill.  Don't patronize me.   I'm not one of your little...  Turn around.  I'm talking to you!... Turnaround!
Anybody would have done it.
Oh yeah?  Me, too.
You have a lot of secrets.
I mean, I want to... I just, I feel strange...
Yeah, well... It's finally over.
... Me, too.
Dammit...  I told them no mayo.  See - - I could veto this Simpson Garner thing, but I really don't want to do that...
We're working on it.
We're doing our best, sir.
No. I didn't stop the infection in time. I know.  Don't worry. When he dies, I won't be like Maria. I'll shoot him.
I have looked bad for four years. Everyone in the world has looked bad for four years. Thank God looks don't matter as much as they once did.
I'm sure that's true, miss. And that's why we're doin' what we're doin'. What's happenin' underground here is just what Lucifer planned for this sinful race o' man. But we're gonna beat Lucifer. We're gonna put an end to what's happenin' here.
That's why we didn't use prayers on this here white coat 'til after he was destroyed. We ready to fight when we have to. And we gotta fight now.
The hospital? 
Maybe.
I say it's poetic. Pure calypso, brother. The Devil's Trumpet blowin' the notes o' doom for the Devil's troops. Ha ha ha ha ha...
Come on. Let's go.
My..."detail", sir. We're going to bury the heads.
Sir!
Actually I don't really know Mutt.
Well, no shit, Sherlock
I don't think they're in school.
Cameron, what is the matter with you. You act like they're your mother or something.  You afraid of them?
Yeah!  Tell him off!  It couldn't get any worse.
Knox, you gotta calm down.
At Chet Danburry's house.
What is the point?
How about a trig study group?  Right after dinner.
Why? Nobody knows who we are.
So much the better.
I'm sorry.  I, we
What?
Yes... sir.
Oh yeah.  Sure.  Valedictorian, National Merit Scholar
Hey, would you not worry about your precious little necks?  If they catch me, I'll tell them I made it up.  All your asses are safe.  Look, Gloria and Tina didn't come here to listen to us argue. Are we gonna have a meeting or what?
Nice meeting you, Knox.  Bye, Gin.
Chet, you don't have to hurt him.
But, Chris...
Huh?
Knox!  what are you doing here?
All I'm asking you to do is listen.  "The heavens made a girl named Chris, With hair and skin of gold To touch her would be paradise To kiss her glory untold."
Well, you did!  Chet found out and he's nuts.  It took everything I could do to keep him from coming here and killing you. You have to stop this stuff, Knox.
Just give me one chance.  If you don't like me after tonight, I'll stay away forever.
I promise.  Dead Poets honor.  Come with me tonight, then if you don't want to see me again, I swear I'll bow out.
It's just for a little while. You promised.
"We went to the woods because we wanted to suck all the marrow out of life." Anybody want to read?
I didn't know you taught.
Courtyard?
A barbaric yawp.
A crazy madman.
A sweaty-toothed madman with a stare that pounds my brain.
His hands reach out and choke me All the time he mumbles slowly.  Truth... Truth is like a blanket that always leaves your feet cold.
Ah, but I am seeing the world, Neil. The new world.  Seeing a student like you take root and bloom.  It's worth everything.  That's why I came back here. A place like this needs at least one teacher like me.  Did you come here to talk about my teaching?
I know what he'll say.  He'll say that acting is just a whim and that it's frivolous and that I should forget about it.  He'll tell me how they're counting on me and to put it out of my mind "for my own good."
Yeah.  He didn't like it one bit but at least he's letting me stay in the play. Of course, he won't be able to come. He'll be in Chicago on business.  But I think he's gonna let me stay with acting.  As long as I keep my grades up.
She's practically engaged to Chet Danburry.  Mr. Mondo Jocko himself.
Nothing.  No mention of it.
Good boy.  Call us if you need anything.
But different.
Where is this cave he's talking about?
Yes.  But
Keating said everybody took turns reading.  I don't want to do it.
They're putting it on at Henley Hall. See, open try-outs.
Jesus Christ, whose side are you on?  I haven't even gotten the part yet.  Can't I enjoy the idea even for a little while?
What is that supposed to mean?
Sssh.  That's what I'm taking care of. They need a letter of permission.
It's my birthday.
We're going to die here! We're going to die!
Boat or no boat...I'm going...
I'll kill you!! I'll fucking kill you!! I'll do it! I'll do it! I'm not playin' around here!
I don't know what these things are ...all I know is...
I told you...
The thieves.
Then who are you?
I don't know...
Nothing...you want to come, come... you don't...
Look lady, I know you people are used to getting your way...
With the emphasis on SELF, and in selfish, right?
You're saying they can think?
You should talk...
Not unless you can wire a missle or fix an engine.
No...
He's not coming...
That way.
Seafood salad.  You ever operate a jet ski?
Joey...
Where is everybody?
Poolside?
A passenger...
Nothing.
She fucked me.
Yeah.
I know...
What?
Fuckin' A!
We're all going.
I'll get it! Where is it?
You're full of shit!
Jesus, it's freezing!
I know, but...
Hey! Fuckin' A! Time to roll!!!
Who? Who is?
It won't open.
Hey, Nick! God damn!... What've you been doin', I mean...
Angela, I just heard Sal was alive.
You talk to him?
Yeah.
Thanks.
No.
Yeah?
Yeah?
Oh, well...
Fine. Hey, I'm fine.
Talked to Sal?  Sal's alive?
Sal's alive???
Listen, Biederman, I'm going to club you into the floor unless you tell me what the fuck is so important.
Biederman!
Hi.  Nick, your shoes are soaking.
Linda... Hey, Linda...
Great. Fine... Once or twice it did fall off the blocks. I don't know what that's from.
Naw, it's... I mean...
I want to go home, Merle.
Merle, I wanna go home!
There's Vince!
I don't think about the shot that much.
I don't know... I guess I think about the deer... Being out, maybe. I don't know. I think about it all. Hell, I like the trees, you know? I like the ways the trees are, all the different ways the trees are too.
You're a fucking nut. You know that, Merle? You're a fucking maniac!
Hell no!
From Nam?
Merle --
What are you, God?
What else?
Okay, okay!  Okay. Okay, you're right... What about Sal?
We what?
Fine. She's fine... Merle, what the hell are you doing?
You wanna bet?
Watch it, shithead!
Right.
Nick. Hey. How's things?
No.
Here. Behind you.
That's who.
No.
Never one.
One, Vince... you have to understand, doing it with one... would be... like nothing. They're small, see, so if you're smart you get about six or eight. I mean, if you want to have any fun.
In the timeless words of Squire Albert...
The fuck you didn't!... Gimme that!
What'cha got, Bennett?
Wade did a little reminiscing.
He just wants me to make him cinnamon cookies like I made for you.
Kimberly!
Avon Lady!
Fuck you - fuck you.
Your mother.
It was Wade's old partner... Gallagher. He was behind it all.
I was set up and you know it... but you swore under oath I was dirty. You helped bury me.
I've been alone for twenty years. I don't feel very sociable.
Where?
He could be brought back.
We seem to've come across a 211, sir.

Doucet killed my partner.
My insurance won't cover it.
Engaged.  Plan on doing it this summer.  You still married?
Good night.
We get to peek into Doucet's brain.
That cost me two weeks' pay.
No thank you, sir.  Smoking causes lung cancer, heart disease, emphysema, and may complicate pregnancy.
What else did he get?
Simulated one.
Not too good.
We're partners, aren't we?
That's just it.  He never did time. Seems each arrest was botched for one reason or another.  Judge threw out the cases each time.  Either he's got a horseshoe up his ass or powerful friends.
I'm signing off.
This is the guy that killed my partner.
He went dirty and they made an example of him.
It's stuck, but thanks for the offer.
No, Jabez -- your place is with your wife --
I've brought you something to keep you warm, Mrs. Stone --
Thank you, Belle --
He lied to me again.
Well, I wouldn't mind.  But my name's Daniel Stone.
And what about Daniel Webster?
No, Daniel -- they are not race horses. They are good old friends of mine. I call 'em Constitution and Bill of Rights, the most dependable pair for long journeys. I've got one called Missouri Compromise, too, and then there's a Supreme Court -- fine, dignified horse, though you do have to push him now and then.
You're wrong, Mr. Stone. There are people who live and die without e'er seeing it. They can't see the country for the money in their pockets -- And some think their state's the country, or the way they live is the country, and they're willing to split the country because of that. Well, I hope you'll meet all those, when you're grown. You'll meet the fire-eaters and the Circassian beauties -- that's part of the fair, to be sure. But if we'd had to depend on them, in a permanent way, the country would have stopped at the Allegheny mountains.
No, siree, it didn't. And it won't -- no matter what happens -- just as long as the folks at the fair believe in freedom and Union. So --  Giddyap, Constitution -- and let's keep going, Mr. Stone.
Why, of course, Hank -- I've always got time for a neighbor. What's on your mind?
Oh -- you don't have to go to Miser Stevens while I'm around.
Not at all, Hank ... not at all. Glad to help you.
Too bad it didn't happen to Miser Stevens.
Belle.
I dunno -- I can't figure it out. I've invited them all. Why don't they come?
What a fine boy you have, Jabez. How old is he now?
What if one hasn't a soul any more? What of that?
Opportunities?
Well, now, Mister, that sounds all right. But--
You promised me prosperity, happiness, love, money, friendship --
I'm through with you.
I have still a year -- a year to make up for everything.
Anything -- anything. -- You can have it all back -- that money -- the new house -- my farm -- the whole caboodle!
No! No! No! Not him -- not my son -- I'd rather go with you -- right now.
About what?
Yes, I did -- but you tricked me into signing it! You told me my soul was nothing ... that I could forget all about a soul, in exchange for money. That was a lie, a lie, a lie.
Seems like it's my fault, Mr. Webster.
That's just fine, Neighbor Stone -- but -- I have to be pretty careful of my seats of honor -- where I sit, I mean. You see, the whole country sort of has its eye on me, Jabez -- anybody in public life has that difficulty -- even you, Jabez. They watch us carefully, our neighbors and our enemies, and they see much more than we think they do -- and understand much more. My friends all like to think that I've got the good of mankind always at heart, and I've got to make sure that those I deal with have the good of mankind always at heart, too. Do you know what I'm talking about, Jabez?
It's your fault! You brought Daniel Webster here -- just to try to make a fool of me! You played the sneak behind my back -- made up all sorts of lies against me! You can get yourself out of my home -- go back to the other house -- that old place, where you belong -- I don't want to -- to talk to you again!
Yes -- at midnight.
Come right into the parlor, won't you, folks.
Headache -- Squire?
Selectman? Selectman of the village? Me?
5000 -- that's just what I owe you.
Hold the splint tighter -- it's almost done.  Go on reading, Ma. This man, Job, he had troubles, didn't he?
Do you think I'm grudging it?
Seed alone won't do, Mary. We have to throw the calf in.
You're right, Mary it's a fine calf. That's why Stevens'll take it for the rest of the payment.
Jabez!
Well -- I -- I don't know -- I would pay our debts and well -- maybe get a new bonnet, but -- really -- I think I would live the same.
No, no. I don't want to be idle.
Jabez!
Oh, Jabez! ...  Did you hear, Mr. Webster? --  Now you'll help him, won't you?
Consarn the consarn --
Hard luck -- like me.
Now look here, Ma. I'm not a boy anymore. I want that understood. I don't aim to stay a one-horse farmer the rest of my life. Mary's got to be the kind of wife a -- a big man needs --
My son! Do you really think, Ma....
I figure that depends a mite on how you get it and how you spend it, Son.
Make out? We'll do better than that!  I never thought I'd be glad for bad luck, but I am. I never thought I'd be glad of a hail storm at harvest time, but I am! Oh, bless ye the works of the Lord in the hail and the storm and the rain!
Fiddlesticks! She don't hear it. Got better music to listen to than that.  There -- that's what I mean.
Let him try it.
Yes, Ma -- I'm ready --
You aren't angry with me?
Gee, would you, Mr. Webster? Honest?
Hullooo!
Pretty good -- that's perfect!
Attorney of record for Jabez Stone. Might I ask your name?
H'm. This appears -- I say appears -- to be properly drawn. But you shall not have this man! A man isn't property! Mr. Stone is an American citizen, and no American citizen may be forced into the service of a foreign prince.
I'll drink to that, Mr. Scratch!
The loneliness? Lonely with all your gold, Mister Stevens? That hardly makes sense.
You can talk to me ...
Argyle.  I'm your limo driver.  Hey, nice bag.
Married.
The past six months.
You're nosey, you know that, Argyle?
But meant her moving here.
Mind if I play some tunes?
Hey, I negotiate million dollar deals for breakfast.  I can handle these clowns.  I want to talk to Hans.  Hans! Sprickenzie talk?
Hey, I read the papers, I watch 60 minutes, I say to myself, these guys are professionals, they're motivated, they're happening. They want something.  Now, personally, I don't care about your politics. Maybe you're pissed at the Camel Jockeys, maybe it's the Hebes, Northern Ireland, that's none of my business.  I figure, You're here to negotiate, am I right?
Hey, business is business.  You use a gun, I use a fountain pen, what's the difference?  To put it in my terms, you're here on a hostile takeover and you grab us for some greenmail but you didn't expect a poison pill was gonna be running around the building.  Hans, baby...I'm your white knight.
It's useless to you!  There's seven safeguards on our vault, and the code key is only one of them!  You'll never get it open!
Who are you, then?
Go fuck yourself.
I'm a cop from New York.
I'm going to count to three...
That was Gary Cooper, shithead...
Whoa, Hans, now you're the cowboy?
Thirty minutes to break the code... Two hours for the five mechanicals. The seventh lock...that's out of my hands.
* Well have a look at what our friends outside are doing and I'll be right up.
When you're hot, you're hot.
I'm an exceptional thief, Mrs. McClane. And now that I'm moving up to kidnapping, you should be more polite.
I would too. * They lock eyes for a moment, but it's an intense moment that says a lot about how they still feel about each other.
No matter what it did to our marriage -- ?
Holly Gennero?
Yeah.  I remember our first date.
Two?  Are you sure?
Not yet, the wife in working on our first.  You got any kids back on the ranch?
I...I shot a kid.
I still feel like shit.
I got it.  But you can tell her yourself.  Just watch your ass and you'll make it.
Dwayne Robinson.  Well, what have you learned?  What do they want?
Then who the hell have you been talking too?
Who the hell knows?  Maybe he was a stockbroker who looked at the Dow Jones and opted for early retirement!
Yeah.
Come on, what's under this?
Okay.
What about the kids?
They're not after you, they're after me.
The robbers in the bank.  They got guns?
Well... I'm out of the hospital.
I'm free to do what I want?  And you think I would want to go with you some place on a plane?  Where? Where ya going?
Sal?  Yeah... Sal is with me.
He ain't going out.  And if I go out he's just gonna kill the people. There's a lot of lives that I'm responsible for... that's all.  So, I can't do anything.  I got myself into this mess and I'll get myself out of it... the best way I know how!  One of the ways is not giving up.  I'm telling ya!
All right, enough!  Who the fuck is on the phone... anyway?  Is that you Moretti?  You on the phone?  Will somebody talk to me?
That's good then.  You've found something.
Do you still want the operation?
I don't know what to say to ya!  I guess I just wanted to say I'll see ya... or whatever.
Oh, God, they shot me with like unreal!
He won't listen to anybody.  He's been very crazy all summer.  Since June he's been trying to kill me.
It made him crazy - so much demand, he'd fly into this rages.  And I got more depressed than ever; I saw I'd never get the operation.  So I tried to take my life - I swallowed about a half pound of pills ... blues, reds, yellows, downers, uppers, screamers ... you name it. But I just threw them up and wound up in the hospital.  Sonny comes there and looks at me and just says: 'Wow!'  So when I hear he's in the bank, I almost go crazy because I know he's doin' it for me.
I can't talk to him.
Oh, no ... Women is all we got.
Nothin' doin'.  I give you one hostage when you bring my wife, and one for the helicopter, one for the jet, and the rest can come home on the jet.
Sonny, come on out!
He's all doped up.
Do what the gentleman says, Howard.
I can take care of that.
Sal, get 'em in the vault.
They make $105 a week to start. They fold the flag, check the place out in the morning.  I don't know what they learn, Sonny.
You know more than the Doctor? You're not okay, look at you.  Come on ...  ... let's get him out ...
I stay here.  Damn it.  I just needed the insulin.  I'm used to it. Go on.  Go on.
Sure - we like you.
We like you, too.
Why not?
Yeah?
What now, Sonny?
Everything's all right?  You okay?
You were terrific, too!
Oh, a long time.  Because I kept asking my husband where the heck could Junior be?  He wasn't around here.  I thought maybe he was in prison or some place.
Because I'm scared, that's why. You never smoked?
For God's sake!  As soon as I'm outta this bank robbery, I'm gonna stop ... okay?
My body?  What for?
You know, you remind me of my 19- year-old brother - only he's got his hair down to his knees - he looks like something that eats berries and roots out of the ground. God forbid I should say something to him like, 'Listen, if you ever smoke marijuana, just remember that it's illegal' and he storms outta the house.  You rob a bank, but you keep your body pure, is that it?
Get 'em in the vault!
Dead or alive?

Yeah ...
They gotta stop sayin' that.
Okay, Sonny.
I'm here.
I've got a jet.  I'll have airport limousine here in a half hour.  I want the hostages.
You got guts.  You think if Sal and me have cut their throats we're gonna let you out?
I just want to see all you young ladies are all all right in here.
The manager, he's diabetic, he's lookin' bad.
We'll have hamburgers on the plane. You ready?
What is it?  Did you just barge in here... He doesn't have plan.  It's all a whim.  'Rob a bank!  What not?'
They're beautiful ...
Yeah - it looks real official.
Goodbye, honey.  Wish us luck!
Well, I'm only trying to get you outta this.  I told them you were in Vietnam, you always had good jobs, you were with Goldwater at the '64 convention, but you had marital problems...
He was very understanding - you ought to talk to him ... Algeria?
Did I say a thing against her?  God forbid I should say anything against that fat cunt.
What'll you do?  Come out.
Oh.  Run.
Maybe...
No!
No.  This really pissed him off, Sonny.  He says you're dead.  He says he doesn't have a son.
I don't know ... It's where they got the money.  I mean, if you want to steal, you go to where they got the money, right?
Like what?  Bank teller?  What do they get paid -  ... they pay one hundred thirty- five dollars and thirty-seven cents to start.  I got a wife and kids. I can't live on that -- You want to live on that?  What do you make a week?
<i>Mr. Bishop... this is Claremont Williams. I own the Williams Brothers armored car service.</i>
<i>My theft insurance policy will have to fork over the ten million... but that will take six to eight months due to Nevada state law.</i>  <i>But you should know sir... that I employ bounty hunters. My bounty hunters can find these thieves.</i>
<i>Chinga te y tu mama tambien.</i>
What about your toe?
<i>The combination code is tattooed on his right arm. You'll never get inside Edna Fender's safe without the code-breaker on that arm.</i> <b> INT. CAST WINNEBAGO -- NEXT </b> Domino rides shotgun with her CELL PHONE to her ear.
Yes.
Show me the tapes. I want to see them.
That's the only way you can cope with the route your life has taken. The fact that you made the choice to pursue this life- style... much to the chagrin of your mother... who is so clearly ashamed of you.  Imagine her shame when we cart you off to prison because you won't just tell the truth about what really happened. <b> EXT. NEVADA DESERT -- DAY FOR NIGHT [MESCALINE TRIP]
This is your last chance. Tell us everything you know.
No. Please enlighten me.
Nice to see you again, Edna.
<i>Mescaline.</i> <b> INT. CAST WINNEBAGO -- NIGHT </b> Domino and the others are all drinking coffee. Alf stares out through the windshield at the GLOW of Vegas in the distance.
Be kind to your sitter.
Crypto-fascist? Who talks like this?!
I said stop it.
Where the fuck do you think you're going?
Domino. Do you have a last name... Domino?
Yeah. I played base guitar for Pat Benatar.
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.
Claremont said we deliver the First Ladies in Needles. Then we go home. No questions asked.
They're gonna edit it together out of sequence so it's more exciting. <b> EXT. BEVERLY HILLS -- LATER ON
Just shut up and do what they say. They're gonna kill us if we don't, Ian.
Okay.  Domino Harvey is here.

My brother.
So, in other words, you are not down.
Boycott Sal's.  Boycott Sal's.
No, are you?  We want some Black people up on the Wall of Fame.
Don't worry about it.  But when it happens and I'm in my boat and ya black ass is drowning, don't ask me to throw you a lifesaver either.
Too long!  Too long.  Now for the life of me, I haven't been able to figger this out.  Either dem Koreans are geniuses or we Blacks are dumb.
One day you'll be nice to me.  We might both be dead and buried, but you'll be nice.  At least civil.
It's gonna be hot today.
I just come home to take a quick shower.
Don't worry 'bout me.  I always get paid.
I'm coming.
Yo, I'm gone.
Stop tripping.
Pretty soon I'll be making a move.
I got nowhere to go.  We haven't had a good sit-down for a long while.
C Duracell.
Mister Se?or Love Daddy, I'd like to dedicate the next record to my heart, Tina.
Fuck!  My money!
Don't worry about it.
What is?
What?
Be off in a second.  Tina, I dedicated a record on Mister Se?or Love Daddy's show to you.
Big deal?  If that's not LOVE, I don't know what is.
Can't do.
Sal, I want my money.
Gotta go.
That's it?
When?
How else was I going to get you here?  I haven't seen you in a week.
Long enough for us to do the nasty.
Trust me.
To get my money.
I am a man.
Hello, Sal.  Hello, Vito.
Who don't work?  Let's see you carry six large pies up six flights of stairs.  No elevator either and shit.
Gotta go.  See ya soon.  Everybody happy now?
Magic Johnson.
Fuck you.  Anyway, Minister Farrakhan always talks about the so-called "day" when the Black man will rise.  "We will one day rule the earth as we did in our glorious past."  You really believe that shit?
That's right.
On the rebound.
I understand.
I love you, Black.
He's nuts.
You listening to me?
Mookie is not to be trusted.  No Moulan Yan can be trusted.  The first time you turn your back, boom, a knife right here.  In the back.
Vito, get a broom and sweep out front.
Mister Radio Raheem, I can't even hear myself think.  You are disturbing me and you are disturbing my customers.
'Bout time, Pop.
Shaddup!  Jade, what can I fix you?
Tell Pino.
Whaddup?
Guys. Give me the two fifty and go away.
... flying gracefully... over the rice fields.
Depends how you define 'new'...
MS. HELLER said not to talk to you.
Ooh gross.
Very good. Back in a jiff.
Well la de da.
No, I'm fine thanks.
It could be anything. You're going to discover a whole new world when you get to school.
I know I am, Mom.
I don't know. I'm pretty familiar with the school and I've never seen that "X". But... I do know something.
And nobody will make fun of your horrible deformity.
JESSICA? Please hold for my reaction.
Who's Captain Rob?
Peg leg?
A-ha! You landed on Candyland! Now swallow it!
I learned it from listening to you! I hate you!
Now you see why he was elected principal?
You look familiar. Did I have your brother?
When you live in the basement of the school, you breathe in a lot of chalk dust. It writes out all the answers on your brain.  Now how about a slushee?
Oh, no. You're not gettin' me again.
That's why you have to drink it fast, trust me.
Ow... What do you want to do, HARRY?
Maybe I should go home and grade papers. Owwww.
And my mouph is frozen.
Sorry. Why are you dressed like a Queen!?
I'm kidding! Of course I'll be your partner.
I think she wants me to come over to put me into the right position to check out her delicates, what ever that means.
Shut up!
I'm sure you're overreacting.
You have beautiful eyes.
Go away, assface.
Good one, Captain Rob. He does look like a you-know-what.
No. What happened?
Am not.
D2.
That's because Captain Rob is not a pirate. We've been through this.
PRINCIPAL COLLINS is a greater American than George Washington will ever be.
Yeah! No more clicks and whistles! Now she speaks perfect English!
And with that complete loser
No Lloyd. Chicks are for fags - I'm not going to do it.
No.
Oh, you're good.
Dietician! This interview is over. You can have the camera back tomorrow. Come by the classroom. Heller heads off.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Special Needs class.
You're just jealous.
Do you want me to pet your head?
Checking up on my friend, Harry.
Maybe it's this mix tape I made you. Or maybe these flowers. He gives Jessica the flowers and tape.
Me too. I'm almost there.
That was fast. Well, did you at least enjoy it?
"My dream date with Principal Collins."
Of course it does.  Obviously in denial.  Maybe we can help.
That's the downside. There is none.
Will that be on the midterm?
So miss snoopy reporter girl, it appears that you've snooped yourself into a corner and snoopcuffed yourself to a desk. Whose wearing the Coconut bra now?
He was a big loser! What are you deaf!?
Damn right I did it. Went back and set the house on fire, his little floozy testified in court - and I ended up doing ten years at Rikers, got my teeth knocked out by Mike the Dyke.
Good. Good. Good. Well, that's good.
How baby-cakes? You've done it all.
I think you'll make a good teacher.
Yes!
What?
Just like the President.
I don't know where it is. It's not here. It's been stolen.
Why don't you see to it the kids are ready for the parade tomorrow. I have to pay somebody a little visit.
I made my peace gesture... the forms of Kanly have been obeyed.
Yes?... How was your journey?
Do not interrupt!!! Do not speak lightly of the spice... ONE SMALL POINT...
Shield practice? Gurney... we had practice -- this morning..... I'm not in the mood.
Is this what you seek?
Paul!!  Paul!!
I will take the boy-man... he shall have sanctuary in my tribe... -- A LOW NOTE on a dip stick is blown by one of the Fremen tribe.  Jessica shifts, Paul sees it, and just as Stilgar begins a reach for his weapon, Jessica turns, slashes out, utters a SOUND, whirls again and with rock behind her holds Stilgar helpless in front of her -- her hand at his throat. Paul moves on her first move.  He races up a rocky incline.
Your Reverence.
Oh great mother!  He's trying the voice. The Reverend Mother said it could save him.
You and your Bene Gesserit sisterhood... I'm not your Kwisatz Haderach...  I'm something different, something unexpected!  I'm a seed.  I am so much more...  You don't begin to know me...
I can't... I can't.
Someone started another thumper....  We're not alone.
Where there is spice and spice mining there are always worms.
You are about to witness something few have seen -- watch!  Watch!
The most lethal poison in the Universe.
Usul... these are fifteen of our fiercest fighters to serve you as your guard... the Fedaykin.
Long live the fighters!
NO!! ENOUGH!! Kull wahad! No woman child ever withstood that much. I must have wanted you to fail. Take your hand out of the box and look at it, young human.... Do it!
My father sent you to test me. Music then?
No.
Because I'm planning on dying soon.
Don't you bave a car?
I have no next picture.
Well, It's about how people have two personalities.  The side they show to the world, and then the secret person they hide inside.
I am always on time.
Hmm... my biggest hit?  That would probably be "Dracula."
Dracula?
No hospital.  Just take me to the couch...
So how'd we do?
I'm not getting near that goddamn thing.  One of those burned me on "The Return Of Chandu."
So why didn't you do it?
Nonsense!  You look great --  Look, uh, why don't you lie down and take a little nap?  We'll film around you for a while.
That's fine, Eddie.  All in the line of duty.
Norma.  She changed her mind.  She doesn't wanna marry me.  Can you put down the gun?
I was thinking about killing myself.
Really?  I don't feel so great.
Soon, Bela... Soon.
No, this is just the second unit. We'll do the main footage later.
I just wish you coulda seen the movie.
This is kind of a stream--
I made it up.  It's horseshit!
Cris, you made it.  Thanks a lot.
Yeah.  It seems a little crazy, but sometimes <u>you just know</u>.  She's perfect for me.
Boris Karloff!?
So did you get his autograph?
Well, I'd really like to know what you think.  Why don't you go in the bedroom and take a look at it?  I'll Wait...
<u>That's not the issue</u>!!  Ugh!  How can you act so casual, when you're dressed like that?!
Oh, just like in the script!
Toss us out on our ass.
Tell him "Bride" is in pre- production.
Dolores, don't you understand?  I'm a director now!  I made "Glen Or Glenda."  Directing <u>is</u> my day job.
I told you this was gonna happen.
That's moronic.  Why would a bit player impress a backer?
I don't know.  Hey Bill, which dress is better for you, the green or the red one?
Well then you should pay him, shouldn't you?
What are you looking at me like that for?  I already gave you my three hundred.
Well, uh, if I could I would...
But Bela Lugosi's in it!
Yes?
Tor!
Mm, not good-lookink enough.
Okey-dokey.
Uh, I don't have much of an appetite lately.
Don't worry.  We're almost there.
It is when it works.  You know the one film of mine I can stand to watch?  "Kane."  The studio hated it... but they didn't get to touch a frame.  Ed, visions are worth fighting for. Why spend your life making someone else's dreams?
So you're not a fruit?
Tits.
No!  It would be something better! Something <u>impressive</u>.  The biggest moneymaker you've ever had!
Because he's <u>my friend</u>.
Gee, I used every frame of film we shot.  Maybe they won't notice.
I did.  I established some tits and ass.
This is my thirteenth pair.
Not good...
I just picked them up on the way over...
No.  I'm from back east.  You know, All-American small town... everybody knew everybody, I was a Boy Scout, my dad worked for the post office...
Yeah!  Don't forget "Mercury Theatre"... And then every Saturday, I'd go to the little movie theater down the street.  I even started ushering there.
Huh?
No! I love sex with girls.
Okay?
Do you want your buttons on the left or the right?
The poor girl's out of a job.
Ed, you're gonna miss your own premiere.
<u>Right now</u>.  Let's drive to Vegas!
Didn't you just make one called "Bride Of The Atom"?
You don't wanna be noticed?
We couldn't afford any more props. If it seems weird, maybe you can add a scene where they eat dinner.
What octopus motor?
Hey, don't blame me!  You didn't say anything about no motor when I was up on that ceiling!
So how long have you known Eddie?
Are you IN5ANE?  <u>I'm</u> the director! <u>I</u> make the casting decisions around here!
You shouldn't be embarrassed by the truth.  Mind if I order some hotcakes...?
Don't worry, I'll teach you.
You mean like a date?  I thought you were a fag.
At what point?
Anything good?
Come on...
Who?
Al!
Al!!
Hank was always good with the ladies. Always good-looking. Hell, he's been dead for two days, he still looks better than me.
So if it's a show and they have a guy die that's writing, but if it's real and they have a guy die that's murder.
Oh, see, studying would've been a huge help. Where were you, then?
Um, yeah -- thanks.
That means a balloon payment and a big raise for the second month.
You know, everything you asked me to do I did. I call you for advice about Shari you say -  "Leave her be, see other people for a while." You just wanted me to get involved with Jill because it made for a better show.
Yeah. Because, you didn't talk me into anything. Everything you wanted me to do, I wanted to do.
What about him -- did he suffer any or was it quick? I'd hate to think he...
We're falling behind.
No! Don't --  Oh, wow.
Oh right, right! She fell down, like a...
Look, Ma, come on out. Really. I need to talk to you.
He made a mistake.
No! I -- All right, look, if you hear from Ray.... tell him to call me, okay?
I'm not! I'm just trying to get some facts.
So does Grandma. So does Shaquille O'Neal. You told me you had a hysterectomy and he ran off with your nurse.
The difference is for twenty years I thought one thing and now it's another thing.
He had a woman in my own bed! And how dare you call him "Dad" in front of Al.  This is your father. This is who was there for you when you needed someone.
But Al is your husband now!
Well, no. You agreed to stay on the air as long as we asked you to. The station entered into this on that understanding. If you had refused we'd have begun this with somebody else. You can't just change the rules in the middle of the game, son. It's not fair to us. More importantly, it's not fair to the viewers. They're interested in you. They've devoted hours and days and weeks of their lives to you.
What's the deal? Did anybody make a decision -
Hey, believe me -1 know I've got a great chance of making a fool of myself, here.
Dynamite.
Yeah.
Weird? If this happened last month it would've been weird. Now with... the TV and... now it's just too weird.
I know, I ...
Ohh...
Exactly. Boy, you're smart.  Why are you so mean to her? What did she do to you?  "Is she good enough for Ed?" Who the hell am I?  Who the hell do you think I should be dating?
Just... just relax. Okay? We won't do anything. We'11 just sit here for a while.
Come on...
Are you all right?
No... Could you?
It's what I do. I yell "Geronimo" and jump out of a relationship.
What do we have to do?
Thumbsucker!
Hi, Shari.  Let's go in the stockroom.
Oh man! They couldn't pick me! They had to pick you!
In a second! In a hot second. Let me ask you something --
Hey. You know-- we're not the same. I got a good life, this job suits me. I come and go when I please --
It's me, Ed.
We'd better go...
Save it.
Yeah. My problem is I've got a brother who writes a sentence like "We grew up in a small, little bedroom." As opposed to a big, little bedroom?
A hundred per cent cotton. Okay, here we go, Andy.
It could be, if you fixed it up. How did you... ? I mean how does anyone ... wind up like this?
What?... Why?
Sure.
That's the point -- this could change things.
That's the whole point. It's all in my head; it's right here.  I just got to get it out there. Tracy wants me to write it so she can read it.  It's beautiful.
You know, Tracy... I don't know how to say this, but...
Jim, don't.  You're scaring him.
Yeah, just --
Well, I thought that... well, the way it always works is that SGA president does a count, then the SGA advisor, you know, for the two independent counts.
You have the key, Mr. McAllister.
I thought those were the rules, Mr. McAllister. If they've changed in any way --
See, it doesn't add up. There are only 801 ballots but 803 people voted. Two votes are missing. Check the register.
I didn't make a mistake. Every vote was there when you sac down
Not wasting any time, are you, Tracy?
You can put those in my box.  I'll look at them tomorrow.
Aren't you supposed to keep them?
I thought you were supposed to keep them.
Should be easy.  So far no competition.
Sure
Good luck, Tracy.
As far as I know, they--
Looks like Tim Kobza.
Look, why don't we just forget about Tammy?  We'll have the assembly tomorrow, everybody'll make their speeches, and I'm sure everything will be fine.
Sporty.
Doing what?
Swallows, unsure what heaven or hell awaits him.
Would you sign it for me?
Take as much room as you want
Nowhere.  I don't have class until second period.
Uh, Jim?
Walt needs to see you.
I have proof.
Your novel? Are you fucking kidding me?
Oh, come on.  You've had a hard year, you're cooped up with the kid all the time.  Let go; live a little.
Dave.
It's the only true thing I know anymore.
Yeah.
I also like bananas.
Paul... Paul.... We'll have plenty of time to get into all this later.  A whole year, in fact. Right now I just need to finish my pie and get home.
Larry, you just take it easy
Yeah.
Paul, get out!
Oh.  Hi, Tammy.  I was just, you know, I went to all your teachers and got your assignments.
Yeah.  Oh, one more thing. Tammy. You know, all this election stuff. 'Cause, you know, everyone is saying it's so weird that you're running against me, and, well, it is kind of weird, and you haven't really told me why you're doing it and didn't tell me in advance or anything.  But that's okay, you know.  l respect your privacy.  I just want you to know that no matter who wins, if it's you or me, there's no hard feelings. We're still brother and sister.  Okay? Cause... and I hope you feel the same.
Till 19-fucking-70.
Merry Christmas yourself, <u>Officer</u>.
Yeah, plain scotch.
No I haven't.  Do you know why Pierce is humoring you?
That's right.  Our motives are selfish, so we're cooperating.
Like I said we were friendly, not friends.
Are you asking me for a date or an appointment?
No.  Now.  You fucked him.
And for good reason judging from what I know of your background.
Of course... But how?
How'd you get them to retract?
Yeah, sure... I got a couple of hours before I have to be at the Victory.  Want to grab a beer?
What are you talking about?
Let my daughter rest in peace.
What was that boyfriend's name?
Stens?  Was it Stens?
Officer White, put down that weapon and --
Let's just kill them.
He had help getting up there.  Two of his fingers are broken.
At least not anymore.
I don't know him.  Mr...
You know I do or you wouldn't be here.  How did you find me?
He no longer works for me.  Find Susan's killer, Mr. White. I'll give you a handsome reward. <u>Whatever you desire</u>.
More.
Before Meeks disappeared he was popping off about trying to move eighteen pounds of heroin.
Deuce Perkins.  Mickey C's narcotics lieutenant.  The night he got clipped, eighteen pounds of Mickey's heroin went missing.
<u>Ear plugs</u>.
It doesn't exactly play like dumb panic.
All right, Ed.  Call Sergeant Vincennes.
I don't have time.  I have --
Say what and so what.
I never truck with no sissies!
Believed what?
Say what?
They shot him in his library.
The youngest applicant by eight years.
Would you be willing to shoot hardened criminals in the back to offset the chance --
White's a mindless thug.
Edmund, you don't want it and you can't have it.
There always are.  But there are also three men and three guns. Matched forensically.  A few loose ends don't matter.
Why?
Two minutes, Dudley.  It's important.
A disgrace as a policeman. Straight D fitness reports from every C.O. he ever served under. What about him?
What's this all about, lad?
That's right.
You're the payoff expert.  I'm just doing my duty.
<u>Shit</u>.  Someone beat us here.
With tinsel and plastic icicles and... on his penis, sir.
Of his penis, sir?
Bud White's been here?
Is the Veronica Lake look-alike one of your whores?
Oh, the best I ever had. Absolutely the best.
I see Bud because I want to.  I see Bud because he can't hide the warmth he has inside him.
Some reality.
You, me and White, huh?
Forget everything else for a second, Lynn.  Is there anything you can give me on Dudley Smith?
When was the last time you saw her, Mrs. Lefferts?
Mrs. Lefferts, I just want to ask a few questions.
I don't doubt it -- Oh, God.
No.  It's felony possession of marijuana.
Sure, he just tried to throw me off the force last Christmas as a little joke.
Jesus.  Jack, that's a story. 'Swish Actor Gets The Gay Blade.' Let me get my camera.
Please hold, Sergeant...
Something like that.
Maybe you should have thought of that before you made Bloody Christmas page one.
You said he was behind an extortion scheme.
Yes.
Nothing.
I'm telling you, I--
Don't know. Did you check everywhere? Maybe it was hidden in something. Maybe there was someone else--
Listen--
Turn on CNN.
Goddammit, shut the fuck up and turn on CNN!
Come straight here. Don't talk to anyone.
I don't know who he is.
Really?
Like a LowJack, but two generations ahead of what the police use. It pulses at 230 Giga-Hertz.
It means the NSA can read the time off your wristwatch.
Pal, you're cooked. It's over. What you did, who you were...that's done. I'd find a quiet job somewhere shoveling snow.
Look, you gave me some work over the last year. We'll call it even.
We said a hundred.
Oh, I'll bet <u>that</u> threw 'em off the scent. I sure hope you covered the mouthpiece with a handkerchief and used a funny voice!
You used to work for 'em, didn't you?
How'd you get around the tap orders?
Where?
Why?
What if we do a mailing to Congressmen.
What if we just fucked with 'em?
No.
I know my phone number and I know the number for SportsPhone. Beyond that--
AmeriTech's data-base.  There's Albert's D.C. office address and his phone's identity code. Now we just reprogram out phone with his ID code and you know what we've got?
You got any money?
Yes. I have her permission.
Is that good?
I'll say.
Thanks.
Listen, Daniel, hang on one second.
<u>Wildlife</u> footage, for God's sake. I don't see how he could've slipped you something that the FBI would be interested in.
Why?
Daniel's life is already ruined. Maybe if you guys stopped thinking about yourselves for a change and--
I didn't want to bother you during your racquetball game.
Hey, did you guys find my stuff?
Oh...yeah, I didn't see the accident.
I'm no expert, but I'm assuming that the impact of a moving bus against his body caused--
I'm not his attorney.
Yes sir.
This guy's a fat-assed Rotarian gasbag.
Not a very good one, but--
Well, you know--
How could you let me find out like this?
I know.
It's not a real picture, Stacy, it's been doctored-up.
I went to the bank to see why. They said you emptied our accounts--
This is science-fiction Robert! The manager showed me the transfer notice with your signature on it.
My father's put me in touch with an attorney. He'll be--
Just reporters.
What happened to your head?
That was for Christmas.
What is it?
Yeah.
Sir?
Don't count on it.
That's not you having a whiskey sour with Carmine Morada.
Oh.
Yes.
I take a straight 15 percent. Brill's fee varies with risk. Perhaps you'd be more comfortable using someone else.
Why?
You got a minute?
Will you hang on just a second.
For the last four years.
Bullshit.
I <u>did</u> care how.
I'm sorry about that.
I'm an investigator with Pro-Tech Security.
We believe he did.
--otherwise we may have to--
That's because your Union bosses <u>are</u> those Guido mother-fuckers.
Mr. Dean--
Why?
Dad!
Having an adventure. I can't tell you about it right now, but I'll tell you about it soon.
No. We're never getting a divorce. We were having a fight. It happens sometimes.
Table 122?
I wrote a check for a thousand dollars. You guys didn't have a table that was in the kitchen?
An investigation? It was a bus accident.
Listen to me.
No, listen to me. You gotta let me bring you in.
To the cops?
No. No, it's okay.
How can I reach you?
Are you still in Crystal City?
Someone's trying to destroy my life, and I'd like to find out who.
I said fuck you.
I just meant--
Dean's with Lyle.
So they know everything.
The door was open, sir. I just need a signature.
The fuck do you have goin' on with Sam Albert?
No.
What kind of fossils?
I'm sorry - what have you noticed?
I don't believe that.  I think you are insulted by me, somehow. You're a foreigner too, aren't you, here, in this market?
What do you mean, poetry?
He said - be careful.
I'm quite all right, thank you.
I believe you still have my book.
That makes it harder still.
Now.
What do I love?  I love rice pudding, and water, the fish in it, hedgehogs! The gardens at our house in Freshwater - all my secret paths.
What?  No!
This is empty, just coming!
No, no, it's Hungarian.  My daijka sang it to me.
That day, had you followed me to the market?
Don't do this.
Why are you people so threatened by a woman?!
What?
Count Laszlo de Alm?sy. The Officer is writing this down.  A glance at his Corporal.
No!  NO!  Don't radio anybody, just give me the fucking jeep!
Yes.  It was.  Thanks for the compass. I'll look after it for you.
Goodbye, my friend. They shake hands.
There is no God.  But I hope someone looks after you.
Because we're fine here.  I don't know what Mary told you about me, but I don't need company, I don't need to be looked at.
She can take you as far as Florence.
And you've forgotten yours.
I don't know.  Paper.  Is it? Paper?  I don't remember.
The rest meant nothing to me.
Is that what you thought?  That I betrayed the British?  The British betrayed me.  The British betrayed me.
Isn't it?  Wedding present from Katharine's parents.  I'm calling it Rupert Bear.  Hello.  Geoffrey Clifton.
Apprentices.
Oh no, really.  She has her book.
To arm-twisting.
Because you're leaning?  No, you're just on an angle.  You're too heavy!
I think they're all in Italian, but I'll look, yes.  What about your own book?
Candaules
I'm not laughing at you.  Go on, please.
Are you crazy?
Me?  He can't.  I'm already disturbed.
Please, don't waste your time on pleasantries -
Yes, of course, I'm so sorry. Stupid of me. Hana gets up, upset to have hurt him.
K is for Katharine.
Why?  Is he staying?
I don't think it does.  Anyway, he's indifferent to me.
Would you like me to?
I love you.
Thank you.
Yes, for your hair.
I've done this.  I've had to do this.
I'm not scared.  So many people have died around me.  But I would be a shame for us.  I don't feel like being shy.
Actually, you can't cut, can you? You'll fall over.  Give me the pliers.
You loved him.
That gun at Lahor, Kipling's cannon - Zamzammah - remember?  That was made out of the metal of ordinary things. I want to make an ordinary thing out of guns. His bayonet is thrust into the forge.  It's red hot.
It's not over everywhere.  I didn't mean literally.
I need morphine.  A lot.  And a pistol.
I'll ask the Lieutenant.  But thank you.
He's sleeping.
Does he have to go?
What if you couldn't find him??  Sergeant, not today, please. Not this morning.
- The Wonder House comma as the natives called the Lahore Museum.
So what do you really object to - the writer or what he's writing about?
What have I been doing all this time? Do you know how many mines I've seen? - more mines than there are soldiers, more - how many mines we've put in the ground ourselves, stuffed in corpses, dropped out of the sky.  And now this.
Go on, do it.  I don't need to hear any more.
Give me a break. Remember Manzini? When he stole Montezuma's scepter he left a Pepto Bismal bottle. The best ones always copy Mac.
And a target guaranteed to catch his interest.
Uh. I'm showing off.
Then don't.
Something of great value, something of such artistic and historic significance that only you could truly appreciate...
Uh, yes.
I'll call an ambulance.
You can't.
Look on the back. What do you see?
That's what you're buying. Put it in your pocket.
I'm not the one to ask...
I guess I have a more optimistic view of human nature than you do.
Good morning.
In a week.
We're doing this together. We're partners.
Without the Mask it doesn't matter.
It was a long time ago.
One more item--not on the check list.
It's a party.
Shut up.
The Mask.
Get the hell in.
You don't know the half of it.
Hold the record. Alone.
Sure, it's only worth 25 million or so, don't bother telling me what you're going to do with it.
I'd taken the Mask?
My job, my rules.
Right. The eight billion.
Guest lists of every A-list party on turnover night. They'd be handy to disappear into, so we're invited to all of them.
Where the money is.
Then the vault, how to get in the vault, that's stumping me.
That's the beauty of it. There's only one tiny window of time when this will work. At the handover of Hong Kong--from Britain to China. The handover from them to us.
Let me guess. His retinal plate is in there.
Oh, I don't care about the money.
They drive so recklessly there.
Hong Kong midnight, happy new year. Except at China Bank.
But--
That would be Thibadeaux. The cop I work for every now and then. Catching thieves. The really good ones--the ones who imitate me.
Next time I'll use valet parking.
Yeah, the lord of the manor doesn't haul his own groceries.
This is big enough.
It's a death mask. Death mask means dead.
It better be worth it for me.
Check out my ball.
Did I ever tell you what Tina wrote? The night she died?
Oh, hell.  I'm dyslexic.
Erin, you've been here three weeks.  If you don't know how to do your job by now, I am not about to do it for you.
I understand they've had a bad run of luck, health-wise, and they have my sympathies. But that's not PG&E's fault.
Wait a minute -- I thought we were negotiating here.
Oh, Jesus.  Who's responsible for his pain and suffering this time?
What do you think?  What's this?
Erin Brockovich.  Car accident.  Not her fault, she says.  And she looks like such an honest girl, don't you think?
It's those files you asked for.
An ER doctor who spends his days saving lives was the one out of control --
She must be a tough cookie, cause it's a pretty advanced case.  I'd say she's been walking around with it for a few weeks now.
Yeah, I can see that.  I guess the only thing that confused me is - - not that your medical problems aren't important, but -- how come the files about them are in with all the real estate stuff?
I know.  But the toxicologist I been talking to?  He gave me a list of problems that can come from hexavalent chromium exposure. And everything you all have is on that list.
Well, then -- if you're feeling up to it, maybe we should talk shop.
And he's making them give five million of it to you all.
Any school you want.
I'm <u>not</u> everyone else, Mr. Masry.  I'm someone you made promises to that you didn't deliver on.  I trusted you.  With my kids' well-being.  Now, I'm smart, and I'm hard- working, and I'll do anything.  But if you think I'm leaving here without a job, you got another thing coming.
I don't wanna take your money, Mr. Masry.
I guess I'm not the right kind.
I got an interesting call this afternoon. It was from a Dr. Frankel.
He wanted you to know the legal limit for hexavalent chromium, is .05 parts per million.  And that at the rate you mentioned, .58, it could be responsible for the cancers in that family you asked about. The Irvings.
They told her something, but it can't have been too specific, cause I talked to her, and she sure didn't think her water was bad.
It doesn't take a genius to look at those medical records and think something's wrong.
Boy, you musta really fine-tooth-combed it then, huh?  And <u>you</u> fired <u>me</u>.  Jesus.
Because they can.  You heard that kid -- they have 28 billion dollars at their disposal.  They can afford to waste all the time in the world.
Erin --
I know how DNA works, Erin --
Kinda like David and what's-his-name?
No shit.
Really?  It makes me sick.
They're trying to intimidate us.  Tell them to wait in the conference room.
What?  Who?
I don't know.  Big.  Dark.
I want my paycheck.  By the end of the day.
He's got a reputation for doing all his --
Okay, look.  It's an important meeting. Kurt thought, if it was just lawyers --
And, what, I'm not serious?
With nothing linking it to the corporate offices yet, I'd say we'll end up on the lower end of that.  Still a lot of money.
Five years, maybe, for a trial.  Double that for the appeal.
<u>I know</u>.  We're having a meeting, it's all set up --
Tuesday at seven, at the Hinkley firehouse.
Because Kurt doesn't want to work with you. He thinks you're a loose cannon.
Erin?  What are you --
Say you shortchanged me and you shortchanged yourself.
"I can always find someplace else to work. Someplace that'll pay me a fortune and give me a view of the French Riviera ..."
And ...?
That's right.
At the time, I thought, I got six kids, some of 'em want to go to college.  I can't afford to lose my job.  I told myself I was being honorable.  But there's nothing honorable in what I did.  Maybe that's why they picked me for the job. Maybe they knew what kind of man I was.
Have you been to the water board?
Hi, Rosalind, this is Erin.  Brockovich. From the file room?  I was wondering if you could tell Mr. Masry that I'm following up on that real estate thing out of the office.
You never fall short for the work people.  I guess maybe you just love them more.
Everyone's.  This is a lawsuit.  We need to be able to contact the plaintiffs.
Just think of me as the person next door who likes it quiet, and we'll get along fine.
You got more than one?
Yeah, and whose fault is that?
I'm not a deadbeat.  I work when I need to.
Better safe than sorry.
Fixing a leak under your sink.
I'm just saying --
No, see -- that's exactly what those arrogant PG&E fucks want me to think -- that because they got all this money and power, we don't stand a chance in hell against them.  But you know what?  They're wrong.
Cause it's my office party.  If you had an office, I'd go to your party.
Thinking.
Mm-hm.
It's not for me; it's for my kids.  You're the only one I trust them with.
Hunh-uh.  Not yet.  Look, don't take any of 'em on your bike, okay?  Call a cab if you wanna go somewhere.
I don't know.  Few days.  Thanks for helping me.  I appreciate it.
Yeah, but I'm gonna get better.  A lot of these folks aren't.
That's okay.  I understand.
What do I look like, Erin?  A library?
What's going on?
You're clever.  I'm sure you'll think of something.
It sure could, yeah.  Thanks a lot.
I'm surprised Donna didn't say anything.
Uh-huh?
Ai, bueno.  Because I didn't want to tell you before, with your worries --
Next week.
No one put me up to anything.  I was just hoping I could ask you a couple questions.
Right, I guess those are the kids --
Asteroids don't concern me, Admiral. I want that ship, not excuses.  How long until you can have Skywalker and the others in the Millennium Falcon before me?
We've come this far ... He is our only hope.
Strong is Vader.  Clouded is your fate.  Mind what you have learned ... Notice everything, everything!  It can save you.
But Han and Leia will surely die.
And that is why I must go.
Growls a reserved greeting.
Okay, okay.
Barks and growls at his boss.
Why don't we just turn him over to Lando to fix?
I'm sure I'll see you again, too. Keep well.  You'd better chain him until it's over.
Barks his agreement.
Barks his agreement.
A great warrior?  Not many on those.  Wars don't make one great.
Not far, not far.  Be patient. Soon you will see him.  Why wish you become a Jedi?
Not likely!  Where are the speeders?
The son of Skywalker.  You must destroy him ... or he will be our undoing.
You're an extraordinary fighter. I hate to lose you.
Go tell your precious Princess ... Luke is dead unless he shows up soon.
Sit down, and shut up!
If I may say so, Sir, I noticed earlier that the entire main para- light system seems to be damaged.
I'm going to see what it is.
Does Luke know?
I respect you.  You're a bold fighter, maybe not the brightest, but ... HAN No, your worship.. That's not what I'm talking about.
I'd just as soon kiss a wookiee.
And you think you're the one to apply some heat?
I had nothing to do with it.  General Rieekan thinks it's dangerous for any ships to leave the system until we know where that probe came from.
Don't worry, your holiness, I'll get her started.
Probably an asteroid field ....
Now you're making sense.
How do I look?
Well, I hope you don't expect more.
Fine with me.  But I'm afraid you'll have to let go.
Felt like a hydro concussion ... an Imperial Cruiser.
Afraid of?  Certainly not you Captain Solo ... or any other man in this galaxy.
Try and control this ...
The entrance is collapsing!
No lightspeed?
Never heard of that system.
It'll be all right.  Trust me.  And keep your eyes open.  You wait here.
Huh?  Oh.  Your droid's been gone too long just to be lost.  He may have gotten into some trouble. Chewie went to look for him.  Come over here.  I want to check this out.
Look, sweetheart, I'm not going to have you accusing my friend of ...
Thanks to you.
I always said you were a gentleman.
Repairs ...
Yes, we keep pollution down by having the power reactor far below the city.  It's connected by a transfer shaft.
You've probably never done an honorable thing in your life.
Wait a minute.  We're not going back there.
That sounds familiar.
I understand.
Not yet.  They're working on it now.
He wants to pay off that criminal he's in hock to.
No!  No different!  The differences are in your mind.  Throw them out! No longer of use are they to you.
But I feel The Force flowing!
No!  Nothing more will I tell you now. Clear your mind of questions ... Quiet now be ... at peace ...
Control, control you must learn of what you see.  Not easy, not fast.
Never.
Yes, sir.  We're in luck.  The sick bay's almost empty except for a mauled fox cub, a deer with pneumonia, and a depressed gorilla. The Apes will be hidden from the public.  They'll be quarantined. If they want medical attention, it's available on the spot.  And the experts can start giving them the once-over first thing in the morning. General Brody's very pleased.
Believe what?
They look pretty docile.
Heavy Third World connections. They get weapons, drugs, fuel, choppers - everything is pumped into the island from the south.
C'mon, Snake - it's L.A. Everything's phony, you know that.
Sure, Cuervo, but look here. I've done it all, man. I killed Plissken, I got your girl back, I got it all. Just for you, Cuervo. Just for you.
What?
We have a little arrangement. Anything happens to me, you're dead.
I don't know yet.
So what's the deal, huh? Go into L.A., find the President's daughter, secure the box, and bring 'em both out - and I'm free?
Tell the President to adopt. I think I'll like L.A.
You don't understand. It's already in you.
There's a war about to be declared, or didn't you know?
Cuervo's got a place near Venice, where the big birds fly. Nice digs, too. I've been there, y'know.
Delgado?
Sure, Snake. No problem.  You gonna kill me?
Yeah, kinda.
Looking to get out.
...Perceval!
Move aside. This is the King's road, and the knights you joined arms against were his very own.
I, the best knight in the world, bested! This is a great day, for my search is over. I love you, my King.
Then make me your champion and I will always fight in your place.
I do. Rise, Lancelot, come with me.
But one can still keep a sword sharp riding out in the name of the King's law.
Lancelot, I will save you... Don't die.
Don't recognize him. You were trapped by Morgana's sorcery.
I dreamed of him too... Merlin lives! He lives in our dreams now, in that dark and shadowy place that is as strong and real as this more solid one. He speaks to us from there.
What's this, what's this?!
The Lady of the Lake. Take it. Take it, quickly!
Never where you expect it, that's all I know.
You betray the boy who drew the sword, the boy who saw the Dragon... the Dragon who moves close by, coiling and uncoiling, restless, looking down, waiting for the King to be a king...
It is like a tree. The roots of the stones spread out across the land and they draw on the thoughts and actions of men. Like sap those human matters course through the stones feeding the stars that are the leaves of the tree. And the stars whisper back to men the future course of events.  But the earth is being torn apart, its metals stolen, and the balance is broken and the lines of power no longer converge. In fact, I nearly didn't make it in one piece.
Rise, Mordred.
So be it.
We fought and won battles, and now one man defeats all my knights? I will go.
Well, then, I shall tell you which knights have maiden daughters, so you can avoid their castles.
The laws, my laws, must bind everyone, high and low, or they are not laws at all. Lancelot will come...
Because you and the land are one.
There is one.
You.
Love demands it.
He has given up.
Dumb riddles, Merlin. I am your King.
Doing what I did for you, it wasn't easy, you know. It takes it's toll. It took nine moons to get back my strength.
You strike me with words as hard as steel.
I didn't know that.
Yes.
I see, your excellency.
Thank you your excellency.
You're sorry. Christ, eighty-eight doctors and all you can tell me is all of your bullshit...
You're telling me that, I should take my daughter to a witch doctor? Is that it?
Hi, how'd your day go?
What's this?
Storage.
Look, he wouldn't have any reason to be up there in the first place.
You're a nice man.
Uh huh. 'Fraid so.
Yes, I go now.
No rats. Thanks a lot that's terrific.
She is going to be well?
What!
No thanks Karl.
Why the math?
Do you think I should take her to see a psychiatrist?
Wait a minute. What are you talking about?
Well of course I'm sure. I'd tell you. Christ, I don't even smoke grass.
No. I'm building a new house, the old one's been sold. I was going to take Regan to Europe for a while, after she finished school here. Why d'you ask?
Please go away.
That's okay. I should've told you I wouldn't be in uniform.
Yes am.
Well, the first thing I'd do is put them into a time macine and send them back to the sixteenth century.
Since we learned about mental illness, paranoia, schizophrenia. All the things they taught me in Harvard. Mrs. MacNeil since the day I joined the Jesuits, I've never met one priest who has performed an exorcism, not one.
Not a psychiatrist! She needs a priest! She's already seen every fucking psychiatrist in the world and they sent me to you, now you're gonna send me back to them! Jesus Christ, won't somebody help her!
What else?
I thought you were supposed to be an expert.
You show me Regan's double: same face, same voice, same everything. I'd know it wasn't Regan. I'd know in my gut and I'm telling you that that thing upstairs isn't my daughter! And I want you to tell me that you know for a fact that there's nothing wrong with my daughter except in her mind! You tell me you know for a fact that an exorcism wouldn't do any good! You tell me that!
No
What?
Your kidding?
No you don't. I do it all the time.
No I do, Captain Howdy said no.
He's nice.
Here I'll show you.
Well you know it's okay.
How do you know?
Why does God let us get tired?
Honey it's to help you.
So something please Doctor, Help her!
Damien Karras.
That's an insult, I got a vow of poverty.
I've seen it.
No.
That's much to vulgar a display of power Karras.
In time.
Until she rots and lie stinking in the earth.
Momma, I'm all right, I'm fine, really I am.
I would like you to go quickly over to the resdence Damien, and gather up a cassock for myself, two surplices, a purple stole, and some holy water, and your copy of The Roman Ritual. The Large one. I believe we should begin.
In the face of the enemy.
Let us pray. Holy Lord, almighty Father, everlasting God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who once and for all consigned that fallen tyrant to the flames of hell. Who sent your only begotten son into the world to crush that roaring lion.
And let my cry come unto thee.
She'll go into coma.
Do people tell you look like Paul Newman?
Only what I read in the papers.
From the psychiatric end.
Maybe. Some rituals used in Black Mass. Maybe.
No I probably wouldn't.
Who's in it?
Come on!
The Dominicans. Go pick on them.
Shove it up your ass you faggot!
I don't know.
If he talks to me, I think he'll leave you. Do you want him to leave you?
You wanted to see me, Charlie?
Little slow tonight.
We don't need you, Frankie.
Too bad.  You could use some sun. Really.
Suit yourself.
I'll take her inside.  You too, little Frank.  Out of the pool.
No bones?
Two at a time?
Recognize these two characters?
How we doing?
Lotta water.
Jack...
Only on odd days.
No, you gotta go 'cause if you don't get up there every couple weeks you feel guilty. I won't feel guilty, so I don't gotta go.
Something came up.  Don't worry, Charlie stayed true.  Both nights. I'll give you your share tomorrow. At the house.
You ask me out here to sell me your house, Frank?
It wasn't like that.
What?
Okay, okay.  I'll call the girl.
It's not gonna hurt you.
I told you I was gonna hit you.
And it's especially nice to be among friends tonight, because, well, tonight's a very special night for my brother and I. This evening we've asked a young lady to join us, a lady Jack and I are sure will soon seem like just another old friend to you all.  She's making her debut here this evening and, as far as I'm concerned, she couldn't be doing it in a better place. Because there's one place that's always been for us a very special place, and that place is this place, the Ambassador Lounge.  Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome a very special lady with a very special way of singing a song, Miss Susie Diamond.
Yeah.  Something.
Right.
Good idea.  To Peggy Lee.
Okay.
Yeah.
I think what Mr. Daniels is trying to say, Jack, is --
Because I can hear it.
Fine.
We were just having a little discussion about morality.
He was wearing a suit.
A gift.  Courtesy of our courteous hotel manager, Mr. Daniels.  We, dear brother, are a fucking smash.  Yup.  They want us back.  Easter.  It seems they have this egg hunt every year.  Only not for kids. Adults.  They stuff these plastic eggs with Timexes and little certificates for free Mai Tais and everyone has a grand time crawling around on the front lawn.  Then afterwards, they have a dance.  An egg dance.  Everyone comes dressed in a different colored shell and at the end of the evening they crack themselves open.  It's our job to separate the yolks from the whites. Slippery business.
Yeah.
The tenth's out.
I play two hundred nights a year with you, Frank. How much more reasonable you expect me to be?
You want to know how much I got tied up in deposits with Willie?  We're in for three weeks solid, Jack.
I don't know. Some disease.
A channel. It's just a little further down the dial, that's all. Look, it's publicity.  Publicity's publicity.  Right?
I'm sorry.  I should've checked it out.  I screwed up.  But that doesn't mean you walk out in the middle of a gig.
Oh. Fine.  It was nothing.  Couple sore knuckles.  Nothing.
Yeah, I know.  Me, too.
Yeah.
Five years ago.  November.
No, no.  You boys are tired.
The flu.
I'm sorry?
Yes, it is.
Impersonally.
That's the premise.
Uh ... we'll let you know.
No. We are not supposed to be backing you up.
Hey!
Time for what?
Okay, okay.  Here, how about this?
We're not exactly silly with time, you know.  Jack, you find anything?
You can buy new ones tomorrow.
I said I was sorry.
For Christ sake, I said it, I didn't do it.  Besides, I don't think they were too offended, do you?
We take the Avedon, right?  Simple.
Smells like tuna number two to me.
No. We got a picture, though. One of the waitresses had a camera.  God, we were just kids.  That was something, wasn't it?
Huh?
Susie.  It's one more show.  One more time.  That's all.
Uh, well ...
Born and bred.
We trust you, Lloyd.  You know that.
I mean, I'd hate to think I'd pick up someone who wore that shit.
You know, I'm feeling a lot of hostility from you.
Baker.
Black.  Labrador.
Downstairs.
I'm tired.  Really.  I should get home.
He'll come around.
Look, they were all on their third Mai Tais by the time I got out there anyway.
Yeah,well, a11 I know is mother nature must be one crazy dame.  Shit.
Huh?
You want me to walk you?
In and out.
Like a baby. You?
Practice.  There are worse songs, you know. Not many, but a few.
No kidding?
He called her.
Long story.
Nervous?
Coffee?
So how's the cat food business?
If I see him.
I didn't want to wake you.
Yeah.  Jesus, you look like fucking royalty, Tommy.
I hope not.  He's already busted the springs in two chairs.  Hey, what's this?
Wow.
What's a prom?
Okay.  How'd yours go?
Sure.
They never should've voted against U.S. statehood -- the scumbags.  We heard you got wasted.
Yeah, real fine.  Especially all the casualties.
... Thanks.
So?  The procnias averano is a South American bird.  The flight here was only three hours!  And yesterday a European swallow flew by! Where the fuck are we?
You shoot hoops like a chick, you smoke like a wuss, and -- I don't know -- you're different.
You porked his wife the day he was arrested.  How could you forget that?
After that.  You promised you'd always take care of me.
"Thanks?"  I guess they really did fuck you up.
Were you there to catch me?
How come?
Eve, listen carefully.  The man you think is your husband -- isn't.
Jon, what is it?
Would it?
Like gangbusters, doc.  Okay, I missed the last one.
And how much will your "fun" net you this time?
Mention my family once more and you're dead.
Vacuum-sealed globe ... shouldn't take long.
Pollux is -- what?
Trust me, he's already here. Get going!
What makes you so sure this guy's gonna set up his own brother?
Janie?
That's your name, isn't it?
Let's try to be a little less formal from now on, shall we?
Get rid of them.
What the fuck do you think happened?  Castor Troy just shot him!  What are you waiting for?  GO!
Are you TRYING to give us away? For somebody with such a big brain, you think awfully small.
Most of the current chiefs -- they must have pretty hefty prices on their heads.
D.C.'s very high on giving you the promotion.  There's just one problem.
Done.  In fact, I was already plotting about the best way to meet the foreign bureau chiefs.
Have fun at work.
They say love is blind. Do you think that's true?
Wouldn't be the first time -- or would it?
I'm not going anywhere.
I'm replacing Lazarro. Nice, safe desk job -- just like you wanted.
So you see, I'm not going anywhere.  Unless it's upstairs with you ...
I disagree.  You think I've been acting strange.  Like a completely different person.
Sure, baby -- go anywhere you want.  But I have to give you an escort.  Security reasons.
Yeah Jack, her assistant...
So you left her?  Just like that?
Stop Jack, I'm getting all weepy.
A broker? Really. And now you're in the tire business?
I'm not trying to knock the tire business, Jack.
What's going on here?
Mommy needs five more minutes in la la land. That could be her present...
Mary Janes, Mom.  You promised.
I think I could figure it out.
Big Ed's.
Don't you think that's a little gimmicky?
I read somewhere that the suicide rate doubles during the holidays...
Kate's my wife...
So could you write down her exact address?
It's me, Jack...
We bowl together. We're bowlers ...we won a championship...we're winners.
Yes, that's it...yes, we went to high school together.
The Caddy?  Why don't you take your own damn car!
Damn, you are the real thing...
Everyone needs something.
You still think this is about me, don't you?
That's my car!  You stole my car!
You mean because you thought I was cocky I'm now on a permanent acid trip?!!
How much time?!
Look, I just want my life back.  Now what's it gonna take?  You wanna talk turkey?  Let's talk turkey!  How much money...?
Figure it out?  Figure what out?!
Are we what, Jack?
Maybe you're not hearing me.  I am Jack Campbell...  Right here.  Jack Campbell, President...
Uh...sure Jack...  Right back there...
No, I didn't...that's great.
If you're into that kind of conspicuous consumption...
You mean don't go at all? What about my internship?
No, you're right.  What are we doing?
Yeah...fine.
Because that's where I live.
And...?
Well that's just great...those little monkeys can be a real handful...
That is the general idea, yes...
Do what?
It's an unbelievable thing.  Wearing this suit actually makes me feel like a better person.  I'm gonna buy it...
Do you have any idea what my life is like?
I wake up in the morning covered in dog saliva...I drop the kids off, spend eight hours selling tires retail...retail, Kate.
Maybe you're not.  The Jack Campbell I married wouldn't need a $2400 suit to make himself feel better about his life, but if that's what it's gonna take, then buy it. Just buy the goddamn suit ...we can take the money out of the kids' college fund.
Surprise.  We're pregnant...  Yeah...that must've been...I mean that was very unexpected.  But what are you gonna do, right?
Sure.  I really like Annie.
Sorry, Jack.  It's too important to me.
Nice, Jack.  You're sweeping me off my feet.
What are you talking about?  You never wait all day.  You can barely wait until it's light out.
But I'm gettin' close, right?
Worse, you mean...
I guess...some of them are probably faking.
I'm out of the doghouse?
Think bigger.
Then get a goddamn snow blower!
That's the one...
No, Jack, I never got married. You?
Thank you, Betty.  I know if I can just sleep this off, I'll be fine...
Why are you staring at my breasts, Peter?
Where is he?
But you're not interested in boutique dollars...  I get it...
You're a little tougher, Peter.
That's easy. You've seen my car.
Is Kate here? Does Kate live here?!
Hey, are you okay?
Of course I did.
So we'll get egg nog.
Jersey?  You know what the traffic's gonna be like?
"Sensual blind chick seeks three-ton, rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual relationship."
Relax, it's casual.
Three days.  I was worried about you. How are you feeling?
Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --
Forget it, egghead.  I'm good as is.
Hey, two hearts got busted last time. Maybe she's not over it either.
Go back to the drawing board.
Hey, I'm Mr. Sensitivity now.  Clear the way, wide load coming through.
Out front?  You home, baby?  I got a surprise for you.
I already got it.  Everything I want.
I'm worried about you.
What is this?  Where's Reed?
To help you.  I've run every test known to man.  And they all yield the same result: <u>the machine is ready</u>.
I'll schedule the launch.  Call me in the morning to talk about resources and crew.
Victor did.
And they're changing into...
What do you mean "complete"?
What are you trying to say?  Just because I dress well and like to dance --
Right, whatever, have fun.
Act.  Here we go again.  Reed, what if we got these gifts for a <u>reason</u>?  What if we have some, you know...like, calling?
Blockhead started it!
At least it beats living in a lab like somebody's science project.
No, <u>I'm</u> sorry, for pushing you out.
It's not just the money.  I could make money in my sleep.
Hilarious.
Get a grip.  Reed.  We didn't come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch.  Just close the shields...
Reed, we're running out of time.
I was talking about us.  Working together.
Right.  That's exactly what I meant.
What...?  <u>Oh</u>.
What about you?  You haven't eaten in days.  How come you're never on this side of the microscope?
I'm sure I can come up with something.
What in the world would give me that idea?
The plants, from space.  Their particles are still charged.  With the right amount of energy, those ions could <u>create</u> the elemental profile of the cosmic storm.
Sue, I've lived my life unafraid of taking big steps.  And this is the biggest step yet.  If it helps, think of this as a <u>promotion</u>.  A merger of sorts...  Four little words that can change our lives...
Just <u>find</u> him.
I told you, I'm fine.  It's <u>you</u> I'm worried about.
Oh, I think you already have.
But it's hopeless! They can't go back and they can't go on. I tell you there's nothing else we can do but remove them!
I can't help it. I'm just weak, I guess.
The Other Side got to him.
Here's the Surgeon.
Sorry, but I'm rusty on surgeons. Who's the girl?
We have no choice. Duval's the most skillful brain surgeon in the country, and he's right here, at hand.
We can shrink an Army -- with all its equipment -- and put it in a bottle cap. That's why we call it <Combined Miniature Deterrent Forces>.
Meet Grant. This is Dr. Michaels, Chief of the Medical Section.
Yes...slowed down agreat deal.
They're much smaller than bacteria...
Now I know...
Not in the hands of a great surgeon like Dr. Duval. The beam of this laser can be regulated to one millionth of a millimeter.
But I did. I'm positive!
I have no idea.
Not now. We need air, not greetings!
Not anything built into the chassis.  If it hadn't come loose --
I feel much better now...
That's what they pay me for.
Keeping an eye on Dr. Duval...
Look! They follow the direction of her glance, are startled to see:
I don't agree. I think we ought to stop and take a sample.
Nothing -- against all that force.
The Breath of God...
Quite a piece of plumbing.
They all lead to the same place -- the Lungs.
No, there's no other way.
Isn't there another route? So we can by-pass all this?
Then why not take it?
What about Dr. Michaels?
Fasten yourselves in. There should be a tremendous surge when the Heart starts up again.
Send the following message...
His Pleura's in fine condition. It should be clear sailing through this area.
I saw the laser just before we started. It was fastened down securely. You don't suppose what happened was an 'accident?' Any more than my safety line snapping after it was tied off to the sub?
I always had an idea there was only one System. The Circulatory.
Let's hope they realize the danger.  Captain, I'll give you a new compass heading.
Where we going?
Go ahead.
Positions, please. And strap yourselves in.
The only danger of turbulence is in the Heart -- and we're not going through it.  Once in the Carotid Artery, we'll remain in the Arterial System... until we reach the point of damage --  -- where Dr. Duval will attempt to dissolve the clot with a laser beam. After the operation, we'll return by way of the Venous System --  -- until we reach the base of the neck --  -- where we'll be removed right here -- with a hypodermic.
On the Repeater.
Then don't drift down further.
Yeah, I just came in. I decided not to park here.
I just pulled in here. I just fucking pulled in here!
Where's my daughter?
No Jean, no money!
Certainly -
What's this, sir?
I'm fuckin' hungry now, you know.
I did.
Whoa, Daddy.
Except that you were gonna be here at 7:30.
Yeah, you already said that.
I'm not gonna debate you, Jerry.
Okay, it's - see, it's not me payin' the ransom. The thing is, my wife, she's wealthy - her dad, he's real well off. Now, I'm in a bit of trouble -
Now we had a deal here! A deal's a deal!
Oh, yah, I know that!
Oh sure.
Yah, got a front movin' in.
Is there anything else you can tell me about him?
Oh, yah?
Yah, that can happen.
Yah!
No, I - they don't want - they're just s'posed to be dealin' with me, they were real clear.
You bet.
What if - what if sumpn goes wrong?
No! We can't let anyone know about this thing! We gotta play ball with these guys - you ask Stan Grossman, he'll tell ya the same thing!
My father-in-law, he's the owner.
Sir? Right now?
Three hundred and twenty thousand dollars. See, I gotta correlate that money with the cars it's being lent on.
Circumstances have changed, Jerry.
Shep said you'd be here at 7:30. What gives, man?
Yeah, okay. Well, siddown then.  I'm Carl Showalter and this is my associate Gaear Grimsrud.
Sure, Jerry, we're all set. Why wouldn't we be?
You told me about it.
Yah, well, seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars is a lot - ha ha ha!
I thought you were gonna show it to Stan Grossman. He passes on this stuff before it gets kicked up to me.
We might be innarested.
2:30.
No! They said no cops! They were darned clear on that, Wade! They said you call the cops and we -
Ah, dammit!
The heck d'ya mean?
Look, Jerry, you're not sellin' me a damn car. It's my show here.  That's that.
Mm.
Well, I don't vouch for him.
Nope.
Margie. Thought you might need a little warm-up.
Oh, yah?
Well, he's got his gun on his hip there, and he looks like a nice enough guy. It's a real shame.
You don't think he's mixed up in -
Uh-huh.
I'm not sure I agree with you a hunnert percent on your policework, there, Lou.
Yah.
Aw, you can sleep, hon.
Yah, I'm down in the Twin Cities and I was just watching on TV about these shootings up in Brainerd, and I saw you on the news there.
Oh, pretty good.
Yah... Yah, yah. Geeze, Margie!
Well, they're a good outfit.
No - I'm sorry! It's just - I been so lonely - then I saw you, and...
It's okay...
Uh-huh.
Yah, he - he's been struggling. He's living with his parents now.
Yah, Linda's fine. You should call her.
Oh. Gary's loudmouth.
Love ya, Margie.
Thanks, hon.
Had dinner at a place called the King's Table. Buffet style. It was pretty darn good.
Yah, not too bad. So it's nice up there?
Yah.
It's terrific!
That's terrific.
And this Shep Proudfoot character, he's a little darling. He's now wanted for assault and parole violation. He clobbered a neighbor of his last night and another person who could be one of your perps, and he's at large.
Well, they're all out on the wire. Well, you know...
Bob.  I'm okay.  How are you?
Yeah, both of us.
Have you finished those reports?
Some of it, yes.
You don't get paid to abuse the copy machine.
Okay.  Where to begin?  With your constant absenteeism?  With your unpresentable appearance?  You're up for review...
Yes?
No, I wasn't aware...
Dynamite?
This is... really a shock...
You can't have the whole brain!
Should we?
Marla?
Really?
So you're staying in tonight?
I got this dress at a thrift store for one dollar.
Would you do something for me?  I need you to check and see if there's a lump in my breast.  I can't afford to throw money away on a doctor.
Feel anything?
Well... thanks, anyway.
Chloe's dead.
What do you get out of it?
Why would you ask if it's a guy or a girl?!
Let go of me...  Leave me alone.
Because the answer's "yes" or because the answer's "no?"
Will you just answer me, for Christsake?!
Your whacked-out, bald freaks hit me with a fucking broom.  I thought they were going to break my arm.
Here comes an avalanche of bullshit.
Absolutely, you have every right.  I need you to do me a favor.
I deserve that.  Anyway, I've... I've only just realized
What?
Yes, fine.  Just, get on.  Stay away a couple of weeks, at least.
Yes.
Oh, yeah.
My suitcase was vibrating?
Yeah, uh huh... yeah?  Oh...
That old saying, how you always hurt the one you love, well, it works both way.
The spork.  I get it.  You're very clever.
And, now it's gone.
We're on our third pitcher of beer. Just ask me.
In reel three, right after the courageous dog and the snooty cag -- who have celebrity voices -- eat out of a garbage can, there's the flash of Tyler's contribution...
No one really knows that they've seen it. But they did.
This is crazy.
Where do you want it?  In the face?
Like hell.  That counted.
Anyone?
My dad.  No question.
Shatner.  William Shatner.
Good answer.
Abe Lincoln.  Big reach.  Skinny guys fight till they're burger.
He was obviously able to handle it.
No.  Not at all.
Marla doesn't need a lover.  She needs a case worker.
Uh... nah...
No, what you're feeling is premature enlightenment.
I don't know...
We don't... ?
An expired community college student ID card.  What did you used to study, Raymond K. Hessel?
I felt like destroying something beautiful.
What should I have told you?
If you died right now, how would you feel about your life?
Nothing.
And, sometimes you control it...
You never talked to me in front of anyone else.
The house is rented in your name.
Um, well... technically, no.
You don't know that.  There could still be people inside.
What?
I think this is about where we came in.
Please understand... I've gotten all I can from this, Tyler.
Don't worry about us, sir.  We're solid.
You told me you'd say that, too.
No!  Wrong!  This man's name is Robert Paulson.
No!
There is no money.
Pleeeeeease!
We need some towels, Lou.  We need replacement light bulbs.
How'd you know?
Well, if you put them on the list, they're already tits up.
Death's list.  The precise order you're going to die in.
How can you say that?  What kind of monster are you?
I...I...
You were there?
What happened when Eugene tried to kill himself out of turn?
Speed up.
I was dead.  And came back to life. An EEG machine.  Where's Eugene?
If only Alex and I had done that with the others, Alex might still be...
That's why Death is working backwards. It's tying up all the loose ends, sealing the rift once and for all This chapter of the screenplay contains scene that do not appear or occur elsewhere in the final movie. In order to maintain the integrity of the screenplay, it has not been edited.
Yeah, you should have specified.
I thought we were finished with this bullshit.  This is police work, not the psychic Hot Line.
Evan Shaeffer's dead.  Guess he wasn't as lucky as we thought.
Does she have a cell phone?  A way we can contact her?
Yeah?
Like I said, it was like I was there. I remember everything.  The sounds of the crashes, the smells, the look on Shaina's face...
We have to tell her she's in danger!
How are we going to find her?  There must be thousands of white vans in this state.
He can't breathe damn it.  I think his lung's collapsed!
Get ready to smile, five guys per girl.
Fix-A-flat?  Road flares? Sunblock?  Mace?
Hey, Dad.  What's up?
What feeling?
I know, we'll be there soon.
Jeez, Mom, stop trippin'.
Yeah, but everything's always in transition. If you focus, even now, one week into summer... you can feel Autumn coming.  Almost like bein' able... to see the future.
It is. But that didn't stop me. Shouldn't stop you.
I'm... really sorry.
I've never dealt with death before. I wasn't alive when my grandparents died. I wish I could know. I mean, all this... could just be in our heads. Now it feels like it's everywhere.
What if Tod... is just the first... of us?
Ohmygod! OHMYGOD!  OHMYGOD!  He's not dead?
Thirty-nine.
No.. I mean, I don't have anything on me. This won't be safe.
I wish you were on the plane!
Why do you think I was hiding?
You get off havin' control over me. Let me choose how to deal with it.
That's a plan.
"Next?"
No... I can't. As long as I'm in here, it's outta my control.
Why would he pull at the wire if he were committing suicide?
In Death...
You saying Tod did kill himself?
'Cause if you say another word, I'm gonna fuckn' kill ya!
No one's that strong.
They're watching me, see if I go to Alex.
You have a responsibility to tell me.
No.
Yeah.  It's not hard once you get the hang of it.  In the wrist. Anyway, I did what I always do when I get one...
Put it in the guard's barracks.  Man they got pissed.  They beat the crap out of me, but... it's kind of a tradition.  You oughta see 'em run around.
Insertion.  Call in to base camp by TRANSAT.  Proceed to point Tango November for rendezvous with our ground contact.  Indigenous agent. Co Phuong Bao.  We've been over this three times.
One hundred.
Keep it down, man.  I got problems.
There are no worse places.
Fermented fish sauce.
Who cares?  Let's just do it and get out.  Go have a Jacuzzi and get laid in Bangkok.  Know what I mean?
Powerful warrior.
Let me see.
Alright.  Home run.
Bastards.  Let's get some shots.
Duck soup.
Took bus, most of way.  I knew you would come here.
Yeah.  Got some business there. What are you gonna do?
I'm authorized to get you out of here.  I thought that's what you wanted.
Not yet.
What's the plan?
We don't try to pull out any of our guys if we find them?
Half their air force is our stuff. Captured.
Sir, there's something else... a TRANSAT relay.  Just came through.
Christ almighty.
What?
About 22 hours on site.
Listen, Kirkhill.  I'm a bit of a fifth wheel in your setup here... I thought I'd go out with the extraction team tonight.  Unless you have an objection.
Have fun.
Look, Colonel... we're all adults here.  This is a war.  A very quiet, very intense war.  People get sacrificed.
It was clean.  Very clean... Rambo was a decorated Vietnam vet, a former POW himself... if he came out and said "No POWs" the sub-committee would buy it.  He gets himself caught he's a private citizen, a whacko, acting on his own.  If he gets proof, it gets lost somewhere between here and D.C.  Airtight. But no... Rambo's gotta be a hero. Thinks he's starring in his own war movie or something.  He put me in a corner.  No choice.
That's a crock.  We don't say that. Do you have any idea the shitstorm if he'd gotten back with that guy? If it went public?  The White House would have to act through channels. We're talking ransom.  Four billion bucks in war reparations to Vietnam to get the others back.  That's billion, Colonel.  With a "B".  For a few guys that've had their brains in a blender for ten years?  A pain in the ass to everybody?  No way. There's no way.
Those men are all dead.
Five.  I never wanted that stuff.
I say we tape him to a chair.
Well did you or didn't you?
You threw him out?
Well, there's nobody special!
Meeting ... people.
I never really...went through a... dating period.
Hey? What did I tell you? Why don't you come? It's just dinner. You'll have something to tell your mother next time she calls.
Got any more bread crust?
Anne, they're MY moods. If you want to understand moods, have one of your own!
It's not funny.  It's... sophomoric and mindless... and dumb.
I was attacked.
Okay.  ... I love you...
Oh, I got a pimple... This stuff is supposed to blend with my skin color... Like it really works, ya know...
Hello, I'd like to speak to Lydia?
I don't know her last name... I'll be off in a second.
What... No... Lydia... I want to speak to... her name is Lydia... I...uh...
What?  The curse'll be lifted?  <u>Will</u> <u>you please</u>!
What does that mean?
And this is our other..uh...co-worker.. Parry..uh...Parry....
He says if I want to get back to work, no problem.  He wants me to come in and talk and... and... <u>that's</u> <u>it</u>!
Thanks.
"I'm an incredible woman?"  What is this, a death sentence?
Slowed things down?  Where have I been?  Have we been going fast!?
First of all, let me tell you something -- you don't know shit. Second of all, as far as <u>we</u> go, what time do you need?  What have we been doing here, except <u>time</u>?  Have I ever... ever pressured you!?
Then what do you want to stay with me for?
How have you been?
I'm afraid not ... Then again, I'm not sure. The beating's bad but it's not the problem... It seems he's.. re-experiencing the catatonia... So, like before, he could snap out it in an hour or in thirteen months or thirteen years... ....I don't know. There's no way to tell.
She gave you the old brusheroo, kiddo... Believe me -- this tart will never make it to your desert plate...
Uh... basement I think...
No...  He is supposed to live there?
I'm a man with a mission, Jack.
It was a crime.
You're so witty.  I'm so jealous... I <u>need</u> to get out of here, Jack, and do something other than sit in this apartment and count how many funny lines you have per page.
Fine.  I'll say no.
Fine.
I was nine in the sixties.
Tonight!  How's tonight?
What girl?  I didn't notice.
No... no... that's all right... I thought I knew her... Thanks...
<u>What</u>!?
Sshhhh!
They work for Him.
Parry... I'm Jack.
Thanks a mill --  And I'll give you a buzz as soon as I hear from the people upstairs and we'll get this thing off the ground... Thanks for stopping by, Jack.  Give my love to the wife and kids.
Huh-huh. I'm deeply smitten.
Well, if every time someone did something offensive they hit in the head with a pebble, I think they might alter their behavior. What do you think Jack...
What are you doing?  Give that back!
All right! Listen - please...don't start drooling or...rolling your eyes when I tell you this but - You shouldn't do this..There is no Holy Grail.
Look, you're only sort of insane, really. People like you can lead semi-normal lives. You could get a job...
Please don't hug me in public again, O.K.?
That's why the Little People sent you. Just <u>like</u> magic.
Come on, try it. Ya feel the air on your body - ya little fella's flappin' in the breeze. ...everybody in the city is busy with their business and no one knows we're bare assed in the middle of it. Come on!
Who are you talking to Jack?
Parry, you don't have to <u>earn</u> a woman. It's the twentieth century.
Well, see, I think she can help...You know women are great..they...they make homes and they..ya know, kill the livestock so the knights can go out and get Grails and...and slaughter villages with a clear head...I mean, where would Arthur be without Guinevere...
Bad example. Just trust me. A woman who loves you keeps you going...gives you strength... Makes you feel like you can do anything...
Yeah.....Hey they're moving....  Am I doing that?
It's just a bum...You know, there's enough in here for the two of you.
<u>Fag..a</u> <u>fag</u> <u>you</u> <u>say!?</u>... <u>"Curst</u> <u>wolf!</u> <u>Thy</u> <u>fury</u> <u>inward</u> <u>on</u> <u>thyself</u> <u>Pray</u> <u>and</u> <u>consume</u> <u>thee!"</u>
You advise us!
I don't like horror movies!
I don't like... uh...  Polish love stories...  ... I like musicals.
Listen, you're very nice... b...
Oh... You mean you don't want to.
Shhh...
Serveza yourself!
No, dammit, I would easy.
Out where?
That's right, hand.
No, I'm not mad at you, hand. It'll be all right. Just spot and follow through...
I'm not.
I hope they do.
You go slippin' around in front a my face, an' in front a Elton an' Stoney. What do you imagine they think a someone you treat that way...
I love it.
I have to see how things are first. My father's sick, you understand? They wouldn't be prepared for me bringing anyone.
It brings out my eyes...
I don't know.
Oh, am I holdin' up dessert?
I can't talk to you right now, leave me alone...
Wait a sec. I want Tita to take a picture of you an' me in front of the place...
You're lucky no one was hurt.
Yeah. That's before the big thaw.
But I can't have any. Is that what you mean?
Okay, I'll make it as easy for you as I can. Give me an omelette, plain, and a chicken salad sandwich on wheat toast -- no butter, no mayonnaise, no lettuce -- and a cup of coffee.
Yeah. I want you to hold it between your knees.
Would you tell her Bobby's here?
Yeah, me, too...
Well, do you -- I mean, have you enjoyed all these... strange things you've been doing?
Uhm hmm.
You're attractive, Tita. If you just did a little more with yourself...
My turn.
Where's Catherine?!
Yeah. I said a week, and I've overstayed myself...
I'll say goodbye to you, Tita.
Well, there's fishing and boating. There's concerts on the mainland and... but I feel silly telling you. This is really your home. You probably know better than I what there is to do.
I don't know. Let me give it some thought.
Tomorrow, then.
It wasn't supposed to be, it just struck me that way.
Nothing. It's just that... I picked the easiest piece I could remember. I think I first played it when I was 8 years old and I played it better then.
None.
I think it's what you think.
Look... You made a very calculated move, and then made me feel embarrassed for responding to you. That wasn't necessary.
What?
Of course I'd like to.
I'm going to pick up some friends of Carl's. Are you all right?
Oh. You have to tell me that.
Catherine...
What?
Robert, let's not be rude, okay?
Well, thank you, that's a very nice thing for you to say.
I took some aspirin and it really upset my stomach.
Well, you're a romantic, Catherine, as are most musicians, and what's more, about to be married...
A dispose-all, what's that but more crap? I've never seen such crap. Oofh, I don't know how people get up in the morning.
Don't call me "honey," mack.
Hold onto this.
Steam.
Yes.
Oh... I'm sorry. Was I singing again?
Then don't go out with me.
Just get the fuck outta here.
Then I want you to go to whoever's sayin' that and tell them to stop.
Of course.
You know. I got a lot, more than one.
You look good.
I did.
Wussup, Victor.
Natasha, Maria, Tina-
Pitt.
C'mon.
If we were at 10th Street Pool you woulda done it right in the water, right?
She lives near Eddie?
'Cause you know what, you're not supposed to know but yesterday she lent me her pills for her Moms and if I don't give 'em to her she's gonna die. You want her to die?
Umm, he got dark brownish eyes, he got a nice nose I love his nose. I love his skin. I love his lips, he got a great smile and he got-
She didn't say she had no man.
What?
Utah?  Jesus Christ! First of all, Alan Stanwyk does not own one share of stock.The three million dollars for the ranch in Provo comes from my daughter who converted some of her personal holdings, not company holdings. Now if anybody in DC wants to make something of that, bring 'em on. Until then, get the hell out of my face.
Hmm. It's just that there are some other people from my office going on this trip and... is there anyone in the seat next to me?
Sonofabitch.
He never leaves the beach, Fat Sam. Never leaves. Sits in that chair, he's outta junk. Then he suddenly gets up, he's got junk. So where does it come from? Through the sand?
I ought to get some sleep.
They didn't do anything.
Full name.
What'll it be Fletch?
Not a prayer.
Thank God, the police.
Go ahead. Make my evening.
Under control? You idiot. You didn't know who he was?
I don't know. I don't have any.
Your aunt?
He was in intensive care for eight weeks.
Just relax....
Just relax.
I can't discuss another patient. You know that.  Well, I can't find anything wrong with you.
Like tonight.
I'm serious, Sam.
What?
Nothing. They're still there.
Yes, right away.
He'll be so relieved.
Found it in a cab. That's a grand. Apply the difference to next month.
How similar in build you and I are. Then I figured it. You bump me off, throw me in the car, and burn me up.
Whoops.
Dropped two big ones. Real fighter. You're in the insurance line, Harry?
Well, I'm fully covered.
Yes. Where you from, Harry?
Course he has. That's his wife.
Where are you going?
You sure did.
Right.
Gee, I must have been shit-faced at your wedding, I don't --
Fletch?
Fletch, I never sold nothing.
I dunno. Somewhere in South America, I forget.
Why not?
Will this proposition entail my dressing up as Tina Turner?
Nugent. Ted Nugent.
My company has taken out a very large insurance policy on me. And I have a wife. Suicide would nullify my insurance. Murder does not.
Where am I going?
The gun, the money, the tickets, and the dying.
No problem, boss.
Nothing to it.
Check every hotel in L.A. Start with the ones near the airport. Yeah. He's about to leave the country with her. Thanks, Lar.
I'm sorry?
John Ultrarelamensky.
I love the outfits.
None of your business, now go away. You're throwing my game off.
It's John. John...  Znhcneelsky.
Hi.
Well, I knew this is where my mouth would be.
Here, take mine.
Yes.
God...
Just like Alan. It's freaky.
Utah is not exactly a cure for boredom.
He never sees them and I never met them.
What is this?
But I've seen the deed.
I'm talking about how much I'd like to take you to a Laker game.
Act natural.
I decided I was going to tell my husband about you today.
Gail, please.
I checked. There was no divorce.
Bastard.
Don't tell me I can't --
Great. I'll have a Bloody Mary and a steak sandwich.
Yes, sir. Beluga. But it is eighty dollars the portion.
Far out.  Larry? It's Fletch.  Well, it's not 'Fat Sam's', but... any port in a storm.  Oh, tell Frank I need a couple of months. The fifty grand's lasting longer than I thought.
Moved out.
This morning.
Go ahead. Call them. Better tie your shoelaces first.
You broke it? You know the source?
He's not the story! There's a source behind him.
All right. Maybe there are some crooked cops involved in all this.
Utah?
Who? Donnie and Marie?
What...
My secretary.
I'd appreciate an opportunity to discuss this with you.
Of course.
But I ain't got you...
Don't say it.  Orange juice?
Mr. Fairlane, I'm very rich.  The kind of rich that warps minds. Nothing offends me.  When I was eleven, I walked in on my father and the Shetland pony he had given me for my tenth birthday. Does that excite you?
I don't have a sense of humor, either.  Sorry.
Who?
I'm sorry, that's gotta be a pair of tube socks he has down there.
Nonsense.  After what you've been through, it sounds like I owe you.
I'll do my best.
What did these Vancouver factories do?
I guess I'm not interested in any club who'll have my member as a member.  Later, Don...
I never thought I'd be jealous of your handicap... Sorry to hear about Bobby Vomit.
Could somebody tell me what's going on?  <u>Like slo-owly</u>...
Exactly.
'Bye Ford...'  Hey, let me cheer you up.  I found the IN X S payment.
Mmmmmmm.  Mmmm, mmm.
Oh, Jazz, those bastards... call an ambulance!  Get that music off!
I've always said the one reason I'm the best detective in the industry is that I'm the only one... but hey, I never throw away a clue...
Johnny's C.D.?
C.D.s.  The music kind.  From the Grendel label.
Let's get hitched.  I guess I, you know, love you.  It's a beautiful thing.
How is it you can look at that HairHead and see God, when all I see is a lucky asshole from Reseda.
You know rock-n-roll?  Darlin', I've been in the music industry for as long as you've lived.  I've seen things you can't even have nightmares about... but then I guess I'm just not equipped to know the industry the way you do...
Okay?  I just blew up.  I feel orgasmic.
But you know, that was just a dream.  Doesn't really count.
I won't ask why you would want to help someone trying to kill you, but hey, good job.  Shall we?
Let go of the belt!  What are you doing?  You got mad at me for trying to save the other guy.
Tell me, Dr. Watson, what makes you think he's not just another piece of shit overdose.
Run to the nearest phone and call the police.
Who's my real father, man?
Disco Ex -- man, that group sucked like a squid, they had some shitty single they wanted me to plug, back in my publicist days...
Yeah, and that lead singer, Jesus, that white Van McCoy wanna-be with the six-inch platform shoes. He looked...
I was about to say he looked like shit, but hey, sure, he looked like you.
<u>I.  Am.  The.  Biggest.  Sissy.</u> <u>In.  The.  Whole.  Fucking.  World</u>.
You gotta be kidding!  This is unfuckingbelievable!  I have to start the evening crawling down Capital Records, I shoulda chose suicide then, but oh no, the night was young!  Next up, my guitar! The second most important thing I own and now it's toothpicks for the homeless on Hollywood Boulevard!  Then, then, after I burned up your brother, Jazz... I should say as a fucking footnote I've usually treated women like shit -- used corsages, the wet spot, you know giving out Domino's Pizza's phone number and saying it's mine... Tonight was different. I felt respect.  I felt love.  Then Jazz left me... and <u>now</u> I get to die!
Boing.  You're one hell of a lip reader.
I was just discussing this whole Vomit thing with my friend Art Mooney.  Do you know him?
Mmmmmmm.  Mmmm, mmm.
Yeah, yeah, I know the third one unscrambles the high bits and the low bits.  Shit, just start torturing me, man.  I didn't even know Johnny had a disc and I can't deal with any 'Don't play games with me, Mr. Fairlane' bullshit.
What is this, are you holding a microphone behind my head?
It's my daughter, man.  I know I never told you about her, but God, I love that girl.  She calls herself Zuzu Petals and she's been swallowed up by the gorgeous hell that is L.A. A fucking groupie partying with the pros.  You have to get my baby back, she's my pride and --
What?
Zuzu Petals.  Sounds like a drug. A lethal one.
Mr. Doyle.
Everything is everything.
Did you ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
Enchant?.  Alain, j'ai r?fl?chi ? votre proposition et j'ai d?cid? d'accepter.
Pour moi?
Non!
Not any woman, Marie.  Just one.
I'm going to put them on the cat.
Most New Yorkers never notice it - most Americans have never heard of it.
Names.
Where from?
A piece of ass wouldn't kill me.
Who's on him?
Walter, I can make this case if the Feds will get the hell out of my way.
Policy man in Queens.
Make it Alexander's, I like the toy department.
There's about a hundred years' parole time in there night or day.
He was the bank on that shipment outta Mexico three years ago.
I can't.
The other guy's a frog too.  Checked in at the Edison.  Had a hooker sent up.
We put him to bed for the night.
I say we keep sittin' on Boca.
This is my case.  Get these guys off my back and let me handle it.
Whatta you got?
For garbage?
What I know is what I told you.
That's Deleon and Hayes' collar.
No, I think he's up in interrogation.
Hey, Rookie.  Be cool.  Just stay with me.  This is what we do.
Did he?
I love you more.
I know.  He loves that thing.
Frank...
Luck, my ass.
Do you know where I found this?
Okay, okay.  I need to go say something to Julia and finish up with the guy on the radio.
He's not gonna stop, Satch.  He's gonna keep on...
Daddy put the wheels back on.  I'm gonna fall.
Wait...
Look, I don't really remember how this thing works.
Queens, New York.
I got fed up with all the bullshit.
This afternoon?
W...B...2...YXB.
What?
1998.
I'm trying to be, Dad.  I'm tyrin'.  It's good to hear your voice.  I missed you...so much.
It was an abandoned warehouse - hit by lightening.  Butch told Ma it was just one wrong turn. Said it wasn't your fault.  You went with the training, with your instincts.  If you'd just gone left instead of right, you would've made it.
October 12, 1969.
Chief?!  Is that you?
October 22, 1969.
Dad, we did something.  Something to make it worse.
That'll never work.  They'll just think you're crazy.
Did you see him?  Do you know who he is?
Sissy Clark, 190 Riverside Dr., apartment 3C.  Tomorrow.  She's a nursing student.  Paying her way as a cocktail waitress at the Peppermint Lounge, on west 63rd.  Left work at two A M...killed in her apartment, between two thirty and five.
Coupla days ago they dug up a body in Washington Heights - Mary Finelli.  Girl disappeared in '68.  Turns out she was his first kill.  Which means he probably knew her.  Most serials know their first victim.  I'm gonna do some checking - see if I can put any of this together...
You there?
I'm right here, Dad.
But we can, we can do it together. Spirit and guts, remember?
No, he tossed the wallet, but he kept the license.
What?
Okay, okay...
Right, now I need you to tape it up on the outside, where he touched it, so the prints keep.
Call the FBI.  Use a pay phone.  Don't give 'em your name, Dad.  Just tell 'em that it was Shepard who killed Finelli and Clark and the others.  That he's the Nightingale.
Yeah, Dad.  What the hell is going on?
What's wrong?
No.  I gotta tell him the address, so he doesn't go in.
Better.
The Ham radio.  That's how come he didn't die in the fire.
April 16...?  That means she was the first.
This case just got hot.  We pull on this string...
I'm just trying to figure what interests me more: the possibility that Daryl is the guy, or you making him absolutely the guy.
Oh, I loved it.  I wish you'd gone.
I try to be.
Talk about dumb luck.  Odds of anybody finding that girl, thirty years later. And then the chances of hitting a dental...forget about it.  Bets part is she's the first victim.  She knew the doer.  I'm betting those bones are gonna do a lot of talking.
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
"He" wanted me to warn you.  Look at this, all of you!
We were looking for something to keep our hands busy.  It was either this or an orgy.  Vera chose this.  What're ya gonna do?
I don't know...
If you insist.
I vote for me.
I love you, man!
It's the last house on the left. She lives downstairs.
Okay, we won't.  We'll just have fun, all agreed?
Is that so bad?
What?
Somebody was in here.
It's deceiving.
... To prove something to myself... to prove I'm stronger than I think I am.
Sure, just watch where you're going.
Yes.
Keep looking.
Look at it this way... things can only get better... Right?
Why?
That's a freakin' fact.  Least of all us.
That's it.  We're driving this baby back to town... in reverse.
He really believes Jason's still alive, doesn't he?
I wish it was.
Yeah, but the game's not over until it's over.
Megan, take your friends back to the camp.  I'll let you know if I hear anything about your counselors.
You watch that smart-mouthing, young lady.
We have!  Trying to track you down.  The phone there is disconnected.
There was this monster.  He was after me.  He wanted to kill me.
All the little kids arrive today. We're not ready to deal with that alone.
Are you ready?  He's taken our young men off to teach them my favorites sport.
Yeah.  Jason murdered them and...
I got a bad feeling of what might've happened to them.
No!...  ... You kids better leave.  This boy here is not well and I need to talk to him in private.
I've seen it.
If I had you where I really wanted you, they'd be pumping your ass full of formaldehyde.
They coulda danced a jig on it an' fed it to goats -- don't matter.  Ya' can't kill Jason by gettin' rid of his body.  He'll come back the way he always do, to drag the kiddies into the darkness and crush their little skulls -- maybe even your skull, Mr. Campbell.
Twenty.
I know everything about you, Diana.
Do you have to ask?
Okay.  So how is Jessica?  You talked to her lately?
Sorry, Di.  I was just going to my car.  I didn't mean to frighten you...
Information like that is very expensive and you don't have the balls to pay the price.
Yeah.  Sit down a second.  There's something I need to tell you about Steven...
Next, you dial a number.
Yeah...
I'm sorry.  I have to bring you to a cell.
What am I gonna do -- I'm locked up in a friggin' cell?!
Okay.
He was dead.  He had to be dead...
The truth?  That Josh, a man I've trusted with my own life on more than one occasion -- let me see if I've got the order right here -- tried to rape Diana...got the back of his head blown off...took a poker through the gut...fell through a plate glass window and then magically disappeared into the night.
Then why were you at her house?!  She didn't want anything to do with you.
About what?
The Captain's been murdered. The buzz is that Jason might be on board.
I think I'll pass. See you later, okay?
I mean, Lakeview High just closed its doors for good, right?
The fire alarm...
We have to get off this ship!!
Don't be ridiculous!
I packed it. Just for us.
But I haven't even shown you my biology project...
Oh dear God...
That lunatic has been spouting off about Jason since we boarded...  It's no coincidence.
He's the son of the Captain, for Chrissakes. You'd think he'd be able to operate this thing!
You're telling a lie.
I'm staying.
I...I can't...
Me too. But I'm not sure Uncle Charles will be.
Really?
About four years ago...at Crystal Lake. I spent a few summers there with Uncle Charles inbetween boarding school.
Give me the degrees first, followed by minutes and sec...
I want to go home. I want off this ship.
Not completing a voyage is against everything he stands for. But I think I can convince him to call a Coast Guard cutter for you.
If I go with you, he'll never speak to me again.  But I'm never going to live up to his expectations anyway...so maybe it's the right thing to do.
Where are they?
Just radio for help, okay???
Very big.
What did you find?
Very bad today.
Contaminated substance. Very dangerous. Shooting mud.
I was barrister in Kenya. I said to him, get off from here. I cannot drive with your body on my windscreen.
Press a button and they give us money.
What was it like?
I say we go.
Do not inhale.
We're talking about something deeper than grudges. How do we respond to personal attack?
It's your best play, Nicky.
The American theater doesn't need people like that.
About an hour and a half ago. I saw her come out of a place. She said she was visiting a friend. But she wouldn't tell me who.
Let's work on it.
This could be it.
About what?
The Red Sox blow a chance to win their first World Series since 1918. You expect me to miss that for an opening night?
Don't talk like that. How prominent? What are you implying?
And he hears it the same time I hear it? What happened to family secrets?
Your mother and I have something between us that's too strong to damage permanently. Believe me, I know this. That's right, nineteen years. And what about the days and minutes? Sharing small moments, sharing memories, raising a beautiful child. We're wedded in the deepest and strongest ways. Lillian isn't only my wife. She's my best friend.
I have a class. I'm late.
We're strangers in the night. The last thing we want is honesty.
Yes.
And Peter Redmond helped immensely. These pauses were exquisitely timed. He made us wait and wait. He built a gorgeous tension and suspense.
Two-all after six.
We stranded five runners in the first two innings. This will come back to haunt us.
Joanne Bourne.
She's my gynecologist.
I never thought of Dr. Wetzel as having a sex life outside the office.
What did it say?
You know the answer to that.
They're only gonna lose.
It's one thing for kids. You get older, you Nhave other things.
But the son is suppose to stop crying.
Since when did that matter?
I can't find it.
So what are you going to do about it?
The most charming gangster in New England. Where are we going, Mr. Lazzaro?
Hey, Toyota. He asked me a question.
Wife and daughter. My father's still alive. He outlives me, starting tonight. Because the Mets just tied the score. It was only a matter of time, wasn't it?
It's a simple subject.
I want to believe.
I want to say it because my whole life may depend on these next few moments.
Life is good.
Matthew.
Because God loves a winner.
Washed away.
Because faith is rewarded.
It's a test all right. They're bringing in Stanley.
This could be it!
I went to college in Boston so I could be near the Red Sox. I took summer classes and the cut them to go to the game. My wife is from Boston. Lillian Ziegler?
Too late. All the elements are in place. Delay the opening and we lose the theater.
But I know you, don't I? I seen you on a poster in the theater district. I'll think of your name in just a --
I kissed Shirley Felder on the teeth.
What color?
Alla puttanesca.
I was one of those silent, listening children. Glued to the shadows.
I hear good things about the new play.
Peter Redmond is an actor I admire enormously.
He doesn't want to meet some out-of- work ingenue.
Is what true?
I haven't come to you.
And I thought, at last, she's here, she wants me.
I'm going home to my machine.
Everyone takes his turn.
In this place there are no untouchables -- and no work is beneath any of us!
No. That is what you get for distracting me.
I'm simply going to prove to Muslims there, and Hindus here, that the only devils in the world are those running around in our own hearts -- and that's where all our battles ought to be fought.
I'm sorry.
Well, we shall try.
Let me hang on with two hands or I will fall.
I think you do.  But I thank God we all don't.
It does. We must be getting old, Charlie.
Lots of hair... and a little like a college freshman -- trying to figure everything out.
"Hell!"
Panditji -- please, help me.
That's right. The word only means "community." But it could stand for "village"... or the world.
Even as a boy I thought so.
My name is Walk-er. And I intend to report it the way it is.
I don't know... I know you are right. I don't know that this is right.
An eye for an eye only ends up making the whole world blind.  We must stop.
That's when you take advantage.
There is nothing I can give.
I congratulate them.
Yes, sir. The day he sets off everyone is supposed to raise the flag of "Free India." Then he walks some two hundred and forty miles to the sea and makes salt.
Yes, sir, he has. The usual -- India's salt belongs to India -- but then he says flatly that he personally is going to lead a raid tomorrow on the Dharasana Salt Works.
No -- but I think I'm going to.
If you did this, no one could control it. No one.
So there's a 20 percent chance he's <i>not</i> dead.
With respect, Sir, many perfectly innocent citizens have left specimens at as many crime scenes.  Maybe he's just unlucky.
Something's not right.
I'll take it out of your damn <i>pension</i> if you question my authority one more time!
Where do we start?
Luca could still be an accomplice.
What a relief.
You're so unconcerned that you have a killer in your midst.
Jerome--?
Now <i>you're</i> here.  Who are your "friends"?
They found him in his office this morning-- beaten so bad they had to check his nametag.
Keep going!!  Keep going!!
I still can't believe they're sending you to the Belt--you of all people--never meant to be born, on a mission to discover the origin of life.
You know I'm scared of heights.
I'm proud of you, Vincent.
Where is your head, Jerome?  You're acting like a guilty man.  They won't marry the eyelash to you.  They won't believe that one of their elite navigators could have suckered them for the last five years.
Complicated.  I couldn't stop her apologizing.
You know how it is with these altered births --somebody told her she's not going to live forever and she's been preparing to die ever since.
How would you like to be yourself for the day?
Antonio, the choir...
I hope he's not just a body.
How do I square the accident?
That's the hair color in his profile?
I've found him too.
We were just looking.
They found an eyelash.
You celebrate, Jerome?
Of course.
I guess somebody beat me to it.
You've never been here?  Let me order for you.
Those checks take forever.
We'll get it later.  Irene, please.
But "if it came to it" then it couldn't have your--  --nose.  How perfect does your child have to be?
We could go together one day.
I'll tell you at the end of the week.
There's a problem, Lamar.
--Unfortunately my son's not all that they promised.  But then, who know what he could do.
They're mine. The one with the moustache is my brother. They stay out of it. We stay clean.
What about her?  Let's c ut up the money, I want to get North.
No.  My old lady must have made a lot of promises.
No way. I've got to get out now.
Hi.
My license expired, let's get out of here.
It looks fine.
I made a mistake. I'll never make another one.
That Beynon's got a long arm.
Whisky and a peach.
No. It's been a long time.
After four years and now the question comes up.
You were asleep.
Is he straight?
But sometimes I cried a lot too.
Want to cry now?
My mind's not on guessing games.
Waiting's hard. You never learn how.
I know you do. But it is different.  It's different.  We'll be all right tomorrow.
Call the ranch, tell Beynotr we'll leave his cut here --
Do it my way.
You sent me to him.
She's on TV.
What do we do?
I can handle it.
You don't like the way things are, I don't like the way things
You've got all the answers. What about when they find the body on the train?
Twenty eight hundred.
I think so... I don't know.
Great. I'm going to sleep twelve hours.
Get your clothes on, move your butt.
Who was it?
They will have our description before we can get a plane.
No, I'm afraid not.
I really hope you have a nice trip.
Tell her you robbed a bank...
Sure can. I'd like an Invicta 12-gauge pump with the twenty-inch barrel.
You were with him?
It's just a walk-in bank. You don't have to be Dillinger for this one.
Just sandwiches...
He took the day off.
Just fine.
Sure thing, mister, it's coming right up. 'Bout an hour. Quiet crossing that is.
You serious?
Wish you hadn't said that. When Slim Canfield's lips are sealed, they're sealed.
A Ford... We have a Ford.
How long have you been married?
I Just want to find a suitcase.
Did Eric Pake pull her?
How?
Nothing. What could I do?
Yes, but listen. Christ, I didn't kill him.
Yeah.
I know.
Good evening.
You stay in the car. I'll come and listen.  What you want to tell me, Thorpey?
Fine...  I want to talk to you.
Yes.
Look, I'm me, right. You're not. We are what we are, like it or not.  Why all the bloody needle?
You bloody whore. Frank was too careful to die like that. Who killed him?
What?
I work for him.
No, do you really?
No.
Entertaining.
What girl?
Your brother? What you talking about?
Don't worry. She's bound to be upset.
I left last year.
Yeah.
No.
What?
Did you work with him, Keith?
Right.
Yeah. He comes in here a bit.
Who's Brumby?
Oh yes? How?
Funny.  Can I phone London?
Yes, Edna, and I must say you've been great about the ...
Ta-ra.
They came back?
That little shit!
Pension him off.
You must be joking. I never eat breakfast,  Did you sleep well?
Yes, thank you.
That's all right, Eric.
Still got a sense of humour?
Oh, Cyril, eh? So it's all girls together, is it?
Sod off.
No? Funny that. Neither did I.
They do that up North.
Ask Jack. It's his old stamping ground.
That, Harry? That's another hundred - twenty-five pounds notes of the realm.
Ha.
That's six hundred pounds, Harry. Two hundred to follow you, and I've raised it four hundred.
...they hold on to their money...
Mmm...
They killed the goose.
It's not right.
I know it's not.  I'll tell you, you got, you know, you got...what did I learn as a kid on Western? Don't sell a guy one car.  Sell him five cars over fifteen years.
Eh?
You know who it is.  It's Mitch. And Murray.  'Cause it doesn't have to be this way.
He is?
Himself?
The leads, the overhead, the telephones, there's lots of things.
Huh.
How?
The Glengarry...the premium leads...? I'd say we got five thousand.  Five. Five thousand leads.
No, we're just...
We're just speaking about it.  As an idea.
Well.  Well...
That's right.
What will he pay?
He would take you on.  Yes.
What does that mean?
So I'm making it concrete.
What do you care...?
Huh?
They stole the phones.  They stole the leads.  They're...Christ.  What am I going to do this month? Oh, shit... 
Down the street.
What?
To the cops?
No.
Why?
You think so?
Excuse me...
...did they...
Don't fuck with me, fella.  I'm talking about a fuckin' Cadillac car that you owe me...
How the fuck do I know?  What...talk to me.
They took the typewriters, they took the leads, they took the cash, they took the contracts...
Yes, I have a problem.  Yes, I do, my fr...It's not me that ripped the joint off, I'm doing business. I'll be with you in a while.  You got it...?  Where are you going?
You call them again.  Mr. Williamson...!
And let's put this together.  Okay? Shel?  Say okay.
Get in the goddamn room.
...then what is this "you say" shit, what is that?  What is that...?
...let me...are you listening to me...?
Either way.  You're out.
...apart from the top men on the contest board.
And what if you don't close.
What if you don't close...?
What if you don't?  Then I'm fucked. You see...?  Then it's my job. That's what I'm telling you.
I'm asking you.  As a favor to me?  John.  John: my daughter...
All that I'm telling you: that one thing you can tell them it's a remarkable sale.
What Roma's trying to tell you. What I told you yesterday.  Why you don't belong in this business.
I...
You stick around I'll pull the memo for you.  I'm busy now...
Because I don't like you.
Will you shut up, I'm telling you this...
What does that mean?
Shut the fuck up.  Ricky.  You have a mean streak in you...  And what the fuck are you babbling about...? 
You sold eight Mountain View?
Hey, big fucking deal.  Broke a bad streak...
They took the phones...
Guess who?
From the store.
Yes.  I did.  This morning.  What I'm saying to you: things can change.  You see?  This is where you fuck up, because this is something you don't know.  You can't look down the road.  And see what's coming.  Might be someone else, John.  It might be someone new, eh?  Someone new.  And you can't look back. 'Cause you don't know history.  You ask them.  When we were at Rio Rancho, who was top man?  A month...?  Two months...? Eight months in twelve for three years in a row.  You know what that means?  You know what that means? Is that luck?  Is that some, some, some purloined leads?  That's skill. That's talent, that's, that's...
He's right, Williamson.
The hell with him.  We'll go to lunch, the leads won't be up for...
What is it?
No, Mr. Roma.  I don't need the time, I've made a lot of investments in the last...
I just put Jim into Black Creek...are you acquainted with...
Go ahead.
Twelve-fifteen.
Oh, my God, you're right!  I'm on the one...  Well, let's scoot...
Kenilworth.
Me.
Okay, okay, I'll be at the resta...
My wife...
But I'm not counting it.  Wednesday.  Thursday.  Friday.  So it would have elapsed.
Yest...
You tell me again.
We're going to speak to her.
Where are you going...?  This is me...This is Ricky, Jim.  Jim, anything you want, you want it, you have it.  You understand?  This is me.  Something upset you.  Sit down, now sit down.  You tell me what it is.  Am I going to help you fix it? You're goddamned right I am.  Sit down.  Tell you something...? Sometimes we need someone from outside.  It's...no, sit down...Now talk to me.
Not to my knowledge, no...
You going to turn State's?
Fuck the Machine.
Guess who?
Why not?
And fuck you.  Fuck the lot of you. Fuck you all.
The...
You did?
Oh.  Oh.  Oh, your "nostalgia" file, they's fine.  No.  Swell. 'Cause I don't have to...
I'm giving you three leads.  You...
The word from Murray is: leave them alone.  If we need a new signature he'll go out himself, he'll be the president, just come in, from out of town...
Mr. Lingk and I are going to...
The Corleone Family, Senator.  We called it, &quot;The Family.&quot;
At first, like everybody, I was a soldier.
She couldn't decide.
That scar-faced bastard will find out what we got from the wholesaler. He won't take a dime less than three hundred dollars.
 You know his friends...real animals. And his connections with the police. Sure he'd like us to tell him our plans so he can set us up for the cops and earn their gratitude. Then they would owe him a favor; that's how he operates.  We'll have to pay.  Three hundred, are we agreed?
I know, it was chaos; but anyway, here I am one week late.  This is for my Mama.  You remember Merle?
I just had a drive; besides, I want to see my brother-in-law Michael.
Deanna, I'm going to belt you right in the mouth!
I'm not afraid of his words.
He will be a man, and then he will come for revenge.
You remember Willy Cicci, don't you, Freddie?  We was all together with the old man Clemenza in Brooklyn... before...uh...
Johnny Ola... Hyman Roth.
I want you to help me, Fredo.
I'd like to come along.  There's been a lot of strain, and I've been cooped up in this room for three days.
I never looked down on you, Fredo. You don't look down at a brother.
No.
It was hard to have him killed.
It was Frankie tried to have me hit.
You know otherwise, Freddie?
...Who?
There's nothing more you can tell me about this investigation?
He's an Italian?
I know.  That's why I brought you with me!
I'm supposed to stay in my house.
I was supposed to take the children to New England next week.
How long does this go on?
Am I a prisoner?
You don't know that's true.  But Kay, just for the sake of an argument, let's assume it is, I'm not saying it is, remember, but... What if I gave you what might be some justification for what he did... or rather some possible justification for what he possibly did.
I know.  I went down to the Barrett house.  But she's gone.  They drove her and the kids to North Tahoe airport.
But if you're wrong...
No.  But if they do have somebody, you'll do three years for perjury if you give them so much as a wrong middle name.
Wait... there's something else.
Kay had a miscarriage; she lost the baby.
It was a boy.
Roth engineered it, Michael.  He made Pentangeli think you hit him. Deliberately letting him get off alive.  Then the New York detectives turned Frankie over to the FBI.  My informants say he was half dead and scared stiff -- talking out loud that you had turned on him and tried to kill him.  Anyway, they had him on possession, dealing in heroin, murder one and a lot more. There's no way we can get to him and you've opened yourself to five points of perjury.
Mike, it's impossible.  He'll be met by the Internal Revenue; the Customs Service, and half the FBI.
I turned Houstan down; I didn't see why I should tell you about an offer I turned down.  Are you sure, Mikey?  Are you sure of what we're doing; what we'll gain; what does the family gain? Forget that, Mike; I already know the answer.
Mike wants it.
Actually, I've come with good news; the Corleone family has done you a favor.
You know there's a Senate Investigating Committee recently set up; we thought it would be unfortunate if they were to trace anything though-provoking to your name.
Do you gamble?
Yes, Michael.
Sleeping inside me.
In a minute.  They're outside with Esther.  I'm very happy for you... I suppose I knew that you're simply too smart for anyone ever to beat you.
Tell me, Michael.  What really happened with Pentangeli?
Michael.
You haven't heard me.
Get out of my hotel.
I'm alright.  Will you stay home for awhile?
The money was sent.
Very impressive.
When do we talk?
Clemenza promised Rosato three territories in the Bronx after he died, and then you took over and welched.
They feel cheated.
I know.  That's why I want you to be fair with them.
I thought we would meet alone.
It's important.
No, she's here.
We will release the hostages, number one.  Number two, we're here for you to count on when you need us.  We're independent, but we're here if you need us.  In general, we'll cooperate with you and your businesses, and you in turn will cooperate with us.  Pari persu.
My lawyer went over this beforehand.
Then Carmine Fucillo and Tony Blue DeRosa will need to be fitted for slabs.
I won't keep you another minute...
Just thinking out loud.
Not so famous any of us have ever heard of him.
The Master is waiting for you.
I'm keeping away.  What you are doing is no business of mine.
What kind of man are you?  Are you a good man?
Expect nothing fancy.
A man who is not married has nothing.  He is a man of trouble. You need a woman.
You're telling me Mr. Whale is a homo.
I have brought you your clothes. All I ask is that you get dressed and go.  We are having a guest for breakfast.
What do I do?
He says here good-bye.  I find it in his room.  He is sorry, he says. He has had a wonderful life.
But I didn't do this!
Nice place.
No.  Iced tea's fine.
You know what they say.  If you have to ask --
But before I retired, you might say I had a brief time in the sun. Fame, as it were.  Tell me, do you like motion pictures?
In my youth, yes, but never in Hollywood.  No, I was merely a director here.
Huh?
Just a year.  I dropped out to join the Marines.
You mean -- you really want to draw me?
Excellent.  We'll have a most interesting time.
Hmmm.  I much prefer "Show Boat" or "The Invisible Man."  Shall we begin?
All right already.  I'll take it off.  Kind of warm in here anyway.
I don't mind.  I'm not crazy about my old man either.
Did anyone laugh?
Proud?  Any jerk with a gun can kill someone.
What you do is no business of mine. Live and let live, I say.
But we have to match the other sketch.
The world is just one kiss-ass game after another.  A man has to make up his own life, alone.
What happened?
How long were you...?
You first.
Not me.
You were a soldier?
You're the one who started it.
I'm game.  Sure.
No.  Definitely not.
Is that why you joined the Marines? For your father's sake?
What happened?
I don't remember that one.
Oh, but it does.  Especially in light of the journey I'm about to make.
Please, Clayton.  Just for a minute.  Long enough for me to see the effect.
Relax, Clayton.  I can't hear you. I can't hear a word.
You're crazy.
Pray you, undo this button.
All right.
Ooooh.
I think I'll hang around.
I thought I'd give you a hand since I kept you open.
She took the night off.  Heavy date.  Some guy she's had her eye on for a while.
"The fault, dear David, is not in ourselves but in our stars."
You know what I mean.  Your reputation.
Well the rest of us aren't.  Can't you remember that?
Yes.  Perfectly.
Only a mad scientist could do this to a woman.
Oh dear.
Good-bye.  So nice to see you...
Bone?  Boom?  Something Bee.  I hire him while you were in the hospital.  He came cheap.
Yes, Mr. Jimmy.  An interview.  After so many years. Very exciting.
I do not think you anything anymore.  Just back from the hospital and already you are chasing after boys.
A visitor.
I'd hardly call our yardman a friend.
One likes to live simply.
Is it now?  Hanna?  I think we'll take our tea down by the swimming pool.
It is, isn't it?  My life as a game of strip poker.  Shall we play?
What rumors might those be?
I guess.
I interviewed him after I met you. I'm his social secretary now. Well, assistant to his secretary.
Don't go away.
Ma'am, the pleasure is all mine.  James Whale.
Yes ... Kip ...
Were it only that easy. I have obligations. The order needs to be filled...
I knew you'd say that, too --
"don't want" the Dodgers to lose or the summer to end. But we don't get to choose these things...
How is he?
How's Atley -- ?
Something like that -
Your girl works in there ...
Consider me gone, Detective --
Cadillac.
Needs brightening ...
The other day....
You'll get the hang of it, kid. You just need to remember one thing -
You got a school teacher or Nancy from accounting, you don't put on Sly Stone or James Brown. You put on Ravel. Rachmaninoff. But if you got some wild one you just picked up at the track, you wouldn't put on Cat Stevens or James Taylor. You'd put on Prince. Or Isaac Hayes. Or, if you really wanted to get after it: Miles.
Very good. Think you can get in without waking her up -- ?
Of course not. I'm Robin Hood. I take from the rich, and give to the needy...
Lazy ... Lazy ... I ask you, Freb: what's the matter with kids today?
Peugot convertible ...
How you doing, man?
You know where the others are?
And there she is --
It's arright ...
There's no one left ...
No ... And they won't take my calls ...
It ain't what you'd call a "good sign"
Thanks for playing, Freb. That's a gimme ...
No.
I knew it. He's changed, Randall. He's a different boy. He's lost that... That sweetness ... It's gone ... And I don't know what to do ...
I got a message. I live at 1443 Locklin.
Oh, for God's sake
Yes, sir -
You've been pre-booked...
It's ear-marked for Mirror Man and The Sphinx...
What do you say, Toby?,
Don't go there, Toby --
I dunno ...
Yeah ...
I think so. There's things I can't feel right now. Like my feet. But ... You think you can get me outta this, Memphis? I'd appreciate it -
Easy ... Take it easy ... We're almost there...
Me.
Me...
Otto called -
I like how you wallop back in here - after four years - and can still get all Clifford Huxtable on my shit ...
It's for assholes. The Legal Buck blows, Memphis.  You know that. Doing this, we make mad bank, my boys are down, the girlies come around and the boosts are a breeze. Yeah, sure, you're gonna get jacked-up every now and then - but ain't that a small price to pay for never, never-ever, having to say "paper or plastic?"
Shocking, huh? We're clear now. It's done. I've never actually paid for a car. I want to see what it feels like
Thought I'd go for a ride -
No problem -
What for -- ?
Now, we go -
Hell, yeah. Ten larger man
Yeah. He's knows of one all right.
Mitch.
That what you want?
A little trick I picked up at the Car Thief Retirement Home ...
I take out my slim-jim...
Kip's not clear yet. We got one more to go --
Oh, yeah. For real, point-five.
Are you considering a comeback tour?
It can be done. Take two days to shop; one to prep. I'll offer up my bible for a small fee. You also have to hope Kip's jerk-circus didn't undo Castlebeck's linkage so much so that he's setting up surveillance teams on every city block. And then get yourself a crew...
She left...
Why do you call it "Eleanor?"
You'll be at the docks ... Keeping Otto abreast of our progress ...
Not really -
Excuse me --
Checkin' it out
The oldest one.  He was in an argument. A lousy ten-dollar card game. The kid pulls out a gun. It goes off. The kid gets killed. The grandmother hears it and finds out he's been arrested. She has a heart attack.  She drops dead right on the spot. Now Jeannie's got a husband and son in jail and a mother in the funeral parlor.
No. Come on. It was the younger one that was the bad one.
What?
Wha?  Me?
Why would I get into that?
Paulie. Why would I? I swear.
I've been all fucked up since I got out.
I thought you were going to stand me up. You looked bored. You didn't say anything. What did you expect. Tommy was all over me. Right?
What bag?
Oh that. Don't worry about that. Nobody's gonna steal it.
She's beautiful.  Look at her. Henry, look at her.
Bring the car round back. I know a place Upstate they'll never find him.
Jimmy was one of the most feared gays in the city.  He was first locked up at eleven and was doing hits for mob bosses when he was sixteen. Hits never bothered him. It was business. But what he really loved to do was steal.  I mean, he actually enjoyed it.  Jimmy was the kind of guy who rooted for the bad guys in the movies.  He was one of the city's biggest hijackers. Clothes. Razor blades. Booze. Cigarettes. Shrimp and lobsters. Shrimp and lobsters were the best. They went fast.
What lions? I'm not going near any lions.
Jimmy.
What's going on? What happened to Stacks? Is everything okay?
They're okay and it's worth it. Ain't it?
There's a shovel at my mother's.
No. It's okay. Just watch this. Watch it.
He's okay. They sobered him up.
He says he's too hot.  He doesn't even know I came here today.  It's like he's crazy. Jimmy.
Don't bring that up. You're the one who wanted us here.
Stayed out? Daddy never went out at all.
I don't want them left back.
Paulie, I swear, I'm afraid. The guy's nuts. What do I have to do? Whatever I gotta do, I'll do.
Fuck you, you fat fuck.
Next week.
Don't get too slap-happy, you're takin' me home first. WILL I don't know, Chuck. It's kinda outta the way.
Yeah, sit in a room and do long division for the next fifty years.
What do I want a way outta here for? I want to live here the rest of my life. I want to be your next door neighbor. I want to take out kids to little league together up Foley Field.
Let's take a walk. EXT. CHUCKIE'S STREET -- DAY
Yeah, it is.
--and he's like "shit! Motherfucker!" And he looks in his rearview and sees this cat-- I'm sorry--
And all the time he's apologizin' to the cat, goin' "I'm sorry." BANG, "I'm sorry." BANG!
So why don't you give me my sandwhich?
Yah, all right...
I told you, I just got change.
What the fuck? I just asked you for a job yesterday!
Shut the fuck up.
Well, you'd be working on the cutting edge. You'd be exposed to the kind of technology you couldn't see anywhere else because we've classified it. Super string theory, Chaos Math, Advanced algorithms--
It's like a small figure, hoverin' over me. Gettin' closer.
--But--
Yeah, can I help you?
Well, he didn't show up for work today...
What're you doing?
Really?
That's right.
C'mon, that guy was a fuckin' piece of work.
I'll cancel every meeting right now. I'll give you a job myself. I just wanted you to see what was out there.
Hey, how you doin'?
I just want you to know...It's been a pleasure.
Find out what?
Good to see you.
This kid's special, Sean. I've never seen anything like him.
They worked together for the remainder of their lives, producing some of the most exciting math theory ever done. Ramanujan's genius was unparalleled, Sean. This boy is like that. But he's very defensive and I need someone who can get through to him.
Not at all.
I think so.
We haven't really gotten into it. LAMBEAU Maybe you should. My phone's been ringing off the hook with job offers.
Cutting edge mathematics. Think tanks. The kind of place where a mind like Will's is given free reign.
I do.
Is it Gerry? 'Cause I don't think it's fine with you. Give him time to figure out what he wants.
Hold on!
I know what I'm doing and I know why I'm here!
He is at a fragile point. He's got problems--
--And why does he hang out with his friends? Because any one of those kids would come in here and take a bat to your head if he asked them to. It's called loyalty!
--And who do you think he's handling? He pushes people away before they have a chance to leave him. And for 20 years he's been alone because of that. And if you try to push him into this, it's going to be the same thing all over again. And I'm not going to let that happen to him!
--I don't want your trophy and I don't give a shit about it! 'Cause I knew you when!! You and Jack and Tom Sanders. I knew you when you were homesick and pimply-faced and didn't know what side of the bed to piss on!
Never been.
I got this mailer the other day. Class of Sixty-five is having this event in six months.
He was my roommate in college.
The boy was here. He came in, sat down and we worked together.
Yeah, Morgan. I got fired.
Hold up.
Will, your not getting off that easy.
Like what, Will?
I'm sure you do. You probably got a real nice house, nice car -- your book's a best seller.
If you wanna hit "Ramrod," take your shot. Take some pride in it. You go to church? So fuckin' what, God loves you. I mean, Christ. A guy as well known as you? By the time you put your disguise on and skulk out of the house Sunday nights you probably look like "Inspector Cluseau."
You're getting defensive...Henry. And hey, cheif--tell the wife, at least. Christ, set her free.
How about the ones on that shelf?
You think so?
285.
Poor color composition, lousy use of space. But that shit doesn't really concern me.
The color here, see how dark it is? It's interesting.
I think you're one step away from cutting your ear off.
You ever heard the saying, "any port in a storm?"
I was thinking about what you said to me the other day, about my painting. I stayed up half the night thinking about it and then something occured to me and I fell into a deep peaceful sleep and haven't thought about you since. You know what occurred to me?
No, I don't.
Lon? He got married. He has a kid. I kind of lost touch with him after Nancy got sick.
What? Do I wonder if I'd be better off if I never met my wife?
"I gotta go see about a girl"? What did they say?
You're kiddin' me.
I didn't ask for this.
Why is it a cop-out? I don't see anythin' wrong with layin' brick, that's somebody's home I'm buildin'. Or fixin' somebody's car, somebody's gonna get to work the next day 'cause of me. There's honor in that.
It's not your fault.
It's not your fault.
Yeah, I think so.
You're Welcome, Will.
I'm gonna travel a little bit, so I don't know where I'll be.
What?
I'm Will.
I kind of got that impression.
Okay, sounds good.
What?
Yeah, I figured maybe sometime this week we could go to a cafe and have some caramels.
So you just want to use me and go?
Yes you have. You were thinking you were gonna get a good night kiss.
No...I was hoping to get a kiss.
Pretty boring, I guess.
Your house must have been a zoo.
Do you know all their names?
I'm sorry, I been real busy.
I'm supposed to understand this.
No.
Exactly.
Then on behalf of my weiner, I'd like to ask for an advance.
Like me?
So, do you play the piano?
--But you can do my O-chem lab in under an hour, you can--
No.
What?
One, because I have a job here and two because I live here--
I'm not sayin' I'm not in love with you.
What, you want to come in here and save me? Is that what you want to do? Do I have a sign that says "save me" on my back?
Well, I'm contracting the land.
You trying to tell me how to run my own business?
Reckon we better begin roustin' 'em out if we aim to get outa here by daylight. How about it, John? How you boys comin'? 
But ain't no reason--
I'll get Rosasharn.
Whatsa matter, Ma? Gettin' scared?
Look at that ol' coffeepot steam!
You're *ticklin' me!*
We got to get outa here right away. Ever'body here? Where's Uncle John?
Gallon or two?
Banana cream, pineapple cream, chocolate cream--and apple.
Sure, but what is this?
Why, I guess so.
Are you aimin' to tell me that the fellas that run this camp is jus' fellas--campin' here?
I can't hardly believe it. Camp I was in once, they burned it out--the deputies an' some of them poolroom fellas.
Anything like work aroun' here?
I been in the penitentiary for four years. 
No, but I aim to before sundown. Gettin' kind of excited about it, too. Which way you going?
Shore it is. It always is, this time a year.
Thought you was in jail.
We was outa food. Tonight we had meat. Not much, but we had it. Think Pa's gonna give up his meat on account a other fellas? An' Rosasharn needs milk. Think Ma's gonna starve that baby jus' cause a bunch a fellas is yellin' outside a gate?
Women is always tar'd.
That's where I get off.
What you mean?
Five they're a-gettin' now, an' that's all they're int'rested in. I know exackly what Pa'd say. He'd jus' say it wasn't none a his business.
And I ain't gonna listen either. I tol' you what I'm gonna do.  And I don't give a hoot in a hollow if they's oranges and grapes crowdin' a fella outa bed even, I ain't a- goin' to California!  This here's my country. I b'long *here*.  It ain't no good--  --but it's mine.
Take her with you!
And can't nobody *make* me go, either! Ain't nobody here *man* enough to make me! I'm a-stayin'.
'S all right, Grampa. You just kind a tar'd, that's all. Somebody fix a pallet.
California.
Sure. We aim to.
You take that plate inside the tent an' you eat it.
You git. Go on now, git. You ain't doin' no good. They ain't enough for you.
They use' to be a sayin': A chile born outa sorrow'll be a happy chile. An' another: Born outa too much joy'll be a doleful boy. That's the way I always heard it.
This got a floor. Wouldn't leak when it rains.
No'm.
I know, honey, an' just as soon as we get settled Al's gonna set out an' look for him. How 'bout gas, Tommy?
Cut it out, Ma, or I'll--
Sassy my foot! I'm jus' sick and tar'd a my folks tryin' to bust up. All we got lef' in the *worl'* is the fambly--an' right down at bottom that's all we *got* to have! Ef some of us dies, we can't he'p that--but ain't nobody else runnin' away!
How come I got to shh? Run out, didn't he?
She'll be awright.
I know. Maybe that makes us tough. Rich fellas come up an' they die, an' their kids ain't no good, an' they die out. But we keep a-comin'. We're the people that live. Can't nobody wipe us out. Can't nobody lick us. We'll go on forever, Pa. We're the people. 
Sometimes they do.
Maybe they got crimes in California we don't know about. Crimes we don't even know *is* crimes.
Thank God!  An' we're still together-- most of us. 
Since before they stopped us las' night.
On a gallon a gas?  Let's set up the tent. Maybe I can fix us up some stew.
You gotta keep clear, Tom. The fambly's breakin' up. You *got* to keep clear.
They killed Casy first.
How'm I gonna know 'bout you? They might kill you an' I wouldn't know. They might hurt you. How'm I gonna know?
Good-by, Tommy.
Could you see your way clear to sell us a loaf of bread, ma'am.
There, them stripy ones.
I know that! But *where* they gone?
That's what I asked you, ain't it?
They come. They come and pushed me off.
Why, she wasn't no more'n a kid when I went up.
Sol' things, chopped cotton--even Grampa. Got us about two hunnerd dollars all tol'. Shucked out seventy- five for this truck, but we still got nearly a hunnerd and fifty to set out on. I figger we oughta be able to make it on that.
How's Granma since we got her in the tent?
Look at 'em! Same yella han'bill-- 800 pickers wanted. Awright, this man wants 800 men. So he prints up 5,000 a them han'bills an' maybe 20,000 people sees 'em. An' maybe two-three thousan' starts movin, wes' account a this han'bill. Two- three thousan' folks that's crazy with worry headin' out for 800 jobs! Does that make sense?
Man bones?
Awright. An' if she gets outa han', I'll be in the right han' corner, this side the dance floor.
Yeah...
I sell biscuits to the Southland.
It's what I do.
What?
Computer guy.
Really?
He gets this way when he hits over eighty-five.
Overflowing with love.
Correct.  That's for you. Keep it.
Since you stood me up on prom night and vanished without saying a word?
Well, you'll have a ball. You seem to have everything everybody wants when they go back. The car, the suit, the watch. The look. That just leaves the little things, like happiness, character, point of view...
Bad people.
Bad television.
Let me get this straight, are you asking me out?
I'll think about it.
Don't rush to judgement until all the facts are in.
--She's not dead---
Okay. Great, Martin, that's just great. Meaning to life... Mmm....
That's probably a good idea.
I'm staying here.
I'll hide.
You don't understand...
I just know.
Mmm.
What stuff?
You understand the psychology of the job.
We could be working together, making big money, killing important people... I'm willing to let you in on the ground floor.
No harm no foul.
I know what I do isn't moral, per se, but if you could just look past that, you'd see a man worth loving.
That sounds pretty interesting...
Those all seem kind of related...
-Look. You want to kill a Good Guy, but not be a Bad Guy, you wait until a Bad Guy kills the Good Guy, and then you come in and kill the Bad Guy, and then you're the Good Guy.
If he does our job, he's our job.
Wait. I have Mr. Grocer for you.
I'm not happy.
Would you describe their position as inflexible?
There's nothing to be done about it.
Never enough.
See you next week.
I'll do it tomorrow.
Tell them my house exploded.
Okay, call them. Fine. Oh-- And if you could find out why they double- booked the job, and who is trying to kill me, and call me back-- that's be great.
Nature made him then broke the mold.
You too.
Kind of crept up on you, didn't it?
To shoot you. Correct.
So what are you doing with your life now, son?
Plenty of signs -- just none of them printed. Who do I get the idea you're not just passing through!
Look! Please! Don't do the "shucks, ma'am" thing again!  I've driven a few thousand miles for a few minutes of your time. I've brought him here -- to your neck of the...  -- mountains. Just take a look at him. If you still feel the same way, I'll be on the road by morning and you'll never see me again. OK? Deal?
When I was first married.
A jogger, huh?
Sorry about that. I thought everything got cleared out. R.B. is my wife... ex-wife... Rachel. We used to live in that house together.
I thought you were an editor, not a reporter?
Just polite. Well, maybe you'd like to try riding again, some time before you go home.
You too.
Need a lift?
He'd be grateful, he'd take real good care with you.
No, ma'am, I'm afraid that's extra.
Well, he don't know that. Just sit the horse.  Good... You have a nice seat.
Yeah. I haven't seen him in a while. He used to come to the ranch over summers, but then he started having friends and was going off to college, so... Good boy. Hal. Lives in New York near his mom.
We did at one point. When we thought we'd have more children. And we after tried. We tried everything, but... wasn't meant to be.
How did you find out all that?
Tom.
How thoughtful of you. And what if I decide not to go?
I can't even get out of bed yet! You're already putting me in therapy!!
I don't want to lie down. I've been lying down enough.
Is that your version of a pep talk?
Grace, I put it on the table near your --
Maybe they should put me down too.
-- enough time tomorrow. I know.
You're amazing! You act like I don't live in that house! Don't you think I hear the two of you!? Don't you think I can tell what's going on? I'm not five years old, Mom!  You want to divorce Daddy and Daddy doesn't want to.
He doesn't have to! It's, like, so obvious you can't stand him.
Did you go riding?
Tom?
I felt it happen downstairs and when I went into the bathroom.
That's not true.
Because you are... one of the most... incredible, bravest, most beautiful woman I have ever met. The efforts you make. Your courage and your dignity.  I don't know where you got it? I honestly don't know how I would have handled all this if I were you.
Good.
Did you speak to Farlow?
Is that absolutely necessary? It'll just make it a bigger story.
Lucy isn't you. We're losing something without you being here. Now, I know this is a rough time for you, but I think we should make another arrangement.
Sure... What's Grace up to?
Okay.
Oh. Right. I'll call him.
I love you.
Doing what?
Yeah.
Robert, Grace isn't adjusting to school. And she can't sit in this apartment all day... I think it would be good for her.
I've called Liz. They can set me up with a trailer for Pilgrim. I thought we'd stay at motels along the way...
No. I was just researching. Calm down.
I can't say he's been all that effective with her.
She will if you think she should.
Taking forever. I just got an additional list of sixty-two employees to interview before Monday. I don't know how I'm going to do it.
Yeah, but nothing I can't handle. Lucy tells me she thinks Gottchalks's plotting, but what else is new.
You know, I just asked that myself tonight. He doesn't know.
Fine. Actually, today was a good day. You should have seen her.
Let's not talk about that now.
Hi. Um, there doesn't seem to be any hotel room available and someone told me to come here and ask for "Tubab" who might to have a place for me to stay. Are you "Tubab"?
Mmm. I made good time.  Pilgrim's in the back. I found a new stable, but they can't take him until tomorrow.
You want to take a walk with me?
We have a business manager. The best around.
Absolutely. I made enough for an army.
I'd love to go there one time...
Soon. We're going to Branson, Missouri to see my cousin Emma married. Frank loves in there.
Well, I have more than a few days, ha, ha... I uh... I'm sort of... not an editor anymore... right now... First time I've said it out loud.
Delayed shock. Or maybe not. I know I could talk my way back if I wanted or... go to another magazine, someplace... Just not sure if I want to.
I fell in love. After that, I never thought about being anything but a rancher's wife. I never saw it like I was losing some other life, just felt like I was gaining one. I know that's not a popular opinion nowadays and I ain't saying it's the right one. We all have to find the life meant for us.
Her leg was shattered so they had to, uh... remove it. She had some bleeding but it's under control.
Annie, no matter what I do, this horse will never be the same.
Problem is, there aren't many volunteers. He's already had enough to sink a battleship. You have a pin, just in case?
Diane takes care of the books. I don't know how, but at the end of every month, everything adds up to the penny.
Tell her they suit the weather better. Their udders are black, 'stead of pink.
Our daddy raised Pure Herefords.
Twice a month they give you a day off to work on the ranch.
I don't thinks you'd want me tripping all over you in front of everybody.
Getting old. Not being of much use, I guess.  What went on out there, Grace? With Pilgrim?
Sure.
Can I come? I'll start a fire...
No, wait, it just goes... "he said he liked to do-"...
No, not yet.
No, I'm just not that hungry.
You just showing off for her!
I haven't been back in over twenty years, but I wouldn't be surprised. The population's larger.
Honey... I was always good.
Where did you learn all this stuff?
It's cool!
It looks good, sir. We've got an uncorrupted hard drive.
Alright sir.
Hackers of the World, Unite!
Yeah but oh man,  wouldn't you just love to get one of those Gibsons, baby? Ooooh!
What is it with this guy?
Shh!
Maybe I should just go to the bathroom or something.
I want it.
...as they snoop onto us.
Go fix the phones.
Yeah? Display?
Blow me.
What's going on?
How did you know that?
Burn!
My... class. You mean I'm not in your class?
Think you can do better?
I said give me time.
What?
Okay. I'll copy it.
I'll make it up to you!
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, well, you know these Japanese management techniques.  Could you, uh, read me the number on the modem?
I think we've got something.
Gill.
We caught 'em.
Cancer?
One more "dude" out of you and I'm gonna slap the shit outa you, okay? Now I'm trying to save you from yourself but you gotta stop letting your mama dress you, man! : Check it...
I copied it from Ellingson, okay? They're asking me about it, alright? Will you take a look for me?
Relax, Burn, he's my guest.
Excuse me?
Basically, uhmm, yeah. Mmm hmmm.
I disguised myself as an Alabama State Trooper and penetrated the FBI NCIC.
So?
Nothing, it's just a minor glitch.
So I have to watch Jamie tonight.
Don't get angry.
I don't know Brady.
Oh really? Well, I'll just let you get back to little Ms. Hot panties.
I don't know!
Get back!
Yes, sir.
Its too late.
I told them to be here by nine. Its not 9:30 yet.
I'm not calling the fire department.
How many people in the bus?
I'm Dr. Hoffman, Medical Administrator.
Like a real sister?
He's coming to get me Rachel.
Yeah, hurry up.
I'm ready. I'm ready. Okay, let's go.
This is great Rachel. Come on.
Real soon, Jamie. Now shh.
Dad, what's going on?
All right.
Hi Jamie.
No. Brady's working there till 6:00 today.
Jamie?
Okay, bye.
Its not over yet.
Isn't this all a little paranoid?
Maybe you ought to wait here till they do.
Oh, Sheriff Meeker, my name is Dr. ...
He's here, Sheriff.
You haven't got a police force! These men may be the only defense you've got.
Be here in a minute.
Now you understand?
I have a place for that.
Poor Laurie. You scared another one away.
I wasn't spooked.
He can still watch.
Thanks.
Annie, you didn't. Tell me you didn't.
Annie!
Here, Lester.
Look, Lindsey, I thought we understood each other...
...Then you rip my clothes off. Then we rip LYNDSEY'S clothes off. I think I've got it.
Are you sure?
Will you call me tomorrow?
May be a few minutes. I gotta stick around here...
Not since 1963, since it happened. Every kid in Haddonfield thinks this place is haunted.
He isn't a man.
If you do they'll be seeing him everywhere, on every street corner, in every house. Just tell your men to shut their mouths and open their eyes.
You're not coming up with much to prove me wrong.
I think you have too much to do tomorrow.
They probably stopped off somewhere. Have her call me when she gets back. I've got Lyndsey here and I want to know what time to put her to bed.
Have a good time.
Hi, Tommy.
Same time, same place.
There is no such thing.
I killed him...
Let's make more popcorn.
He was doing all right last night. Maybe somebody around here gave him lessons.
Your compassion is overwhelming, Doctor.
Only minimum security.
The only thin that ever bothers me is their jibberish. When they start raving on and on...
Mmm?
I know.  You're an actress with a great flair for shrimp puffs.
Oh.
Oh--
Well, let's do it.
Oh, is that what it is?
Yeah.
Uh...
Well, I-I-I didn't know what to say. First I said no, but then, he pressed it.  He said, uh, he'd taken you once and he really wanted to invite me.
Do you remember that summer in France?  Hannah, you had jet lag for six straight weeks.
Really?  How flattering!  Did you try the shrimp puffs?
We're actresses.
It's terrific!
Well...
Yes.
No, I-I've been perfectly healthy. You know me.
When did you first notice this?
The hospital?  What kind of tests?
Could you--
How's Frederick?  He didn't come.
Oh, I don't know.  My unemployment checks are running out.  Um, I was thinking of taking some courses at Columbia with the last of my savings.
What are you doing here?
Oh, what, in this section of town?
Oh.  You must have been, uh, very unhappy.
Don't let me get started on my childhood.  Oh, you know what?  There is a bookstore.
Yes?
I'm...all right.
Oh, no, I can't let you get me that. That's too much.
Yes, it made me cry  it was so beautiful...so romantic.
Not because of me, I hope.
I don't want anyone else ever to have you.
Oh, my God.
No, she doesn't, either.  You've got tons as well.
Let's go have dinner, shall we?
Because it's the last thing in the world we need right now.
Do you feel, um...are you disenchanted with our marriage?
I am glad to see you.
That thought doesn't terrify you?
I don't understand.  Aren't you frightened?
No, nothing.
Mmm...
You missed a very dull TV show about Auschwitz.  More gruesome film clips...and more puzzled intellectuals declaring their mystification over the systematic murder of millions.
Yes, we're going to have this conversation again.  I...I have to leave.  I have to move out.
Because I have to!
Hello?
I can't keep my mind on the show.
Like what?!  What?
No, I was happy, but I just didn't realize I was happy.
Mickey, you're off the hook.  You should be celebrating.
A week ago, I bought a rifle.
Yes, but doesn't that ruin everything for you?  That makes everything...
I know, I know, and your hamster.
You look so beautiful.
Hi.  She's auditioning for a television commercial.  She said she's gonna be a little late.
Oh, me, I'm okay.
How are you?
Oh...
Oh, no!  I mean, everyone thinks things like that.
Huh?
I don't know.  Excessive masturbation?
You know, where I-I-I would get implanted from a-a donor.
...from Mavis, also.
The sacrifices I've made because of that man.  He's ruined me with his ego, his philandering, his--  his-his-his-his mediocrity!
Yes, she's lovely, but she doesn't have your spark.  She knows it.  She worships you. She wouldn't dare get up there on the stage.
Mmm, I never get upset over that. Mmm?
Will you just tell me one thing?
Are we talking about cocaine again?
I should get a garter belt.
When does Frederick ever come with her?
It's, uh, you never know--
He's not a loser at all!
Well, how about this?
Well, I think he was dying to open up.  It's so sad.  Now...what should I wear to my audition?
Yeah.  Well, maybe I'll get it. 
I'm not!  I'm not!  I'm trying to be helpful.  A person doesn't just say one day, "Okay, now-now I'm finished as an actress.  Now I'm a writer."  I mean--
How?
Uh, losers!  All losers!
You know, I could always tell what you thought of me by the type of men you fixed me up with!
Take...take a year.  Take six months.  Whatever you want.  Who knows?  Maybe you'll, maybe you'll be sitting with a good play.
No!
Do you mind?  I'm-I'm my own person.
Yeah, that's tough!  You don't deserve Cole Porter.  You should stay with those groups that look like they're gonna stab their mother!
Yeah.  Me, too.
I remember you.
...in a really horrible way.
You look wonderful.  You do.  What happened to you?
Well, I hope you've changed.
Yeah, and for yours.  I'm sure you've changed.
I've done no television whatsoever. No.
Oh, well.
It's great.  I swea-- I'm-- I'm, tch, I'm speechless.  I was...I was not in the mood to listen to this thing now.  I don't know what to say.  I'm moved and I laughed and I-- Uh, I, you know, I was on the edge of my seat.  I just think it's wonderful! I'm, I'm totally...stunned.  This is not an insult.  I'm amazed that you can...  It was-- I just thought it was great.
Well, it was just fabulous!  I'm, I, you know...
Oh, don't be silly!  No!  Don't be ridiculous.
Yeah.
Hi.
I need an antihistamine.  Mom thinks she's feeling her asthma, and so...
At least she isn't drinking.  Did you notice?
You're welcome.  Hare Krishna.
They're offering... 
...I was <u>working</u>...
I hereby acknowledge that...
...what <u>hindered</u> you...?
Orderly.
Waal, because your <u>selling</u>'em... Two years ago, his annotated Dictionary of Cuisine, by Alexander Dumas, went for sixteen thousand dollars. Seller's affidavit of ownership, signed Cary Panz.  P.A.N.Z.  Sounds to me like an Orderly.  Whadja clear on the book? Ten, twelve grand?
Then who's buying it?
<u>That's</u> the spirit...
You want me to be?
Because we both know who's buying the Lechteriana.
All y'got to do is <u>ask</u>... 
~Don't shoot, G-Men..."
...would you excuse me...?
Bad coffee, and women with excessive ankles.
What's up...?
Impossible.
Our operatives in Brazil have been empowered to offer a reward of....
...Let's see the pigs, please.
Show me the Pigs.
Follow Starling, stake out Starling. Increase the pressure on Starling.  He will come to her.
No.  And...
He was the orderly, during Dr. Lechter's stay in Prison.
....I hardly <u>think</u> so... after "The Incident"...
...Mr. Verger would be pleased to make a contribution, to the charitable...
Come on, stay with us.  Look here:  I could get behind you, and give you a <u>spinal</u>, tomorrow, you wuunt feel <u>anything</u> down there, a l'il <u>pulling</u> is all.  N'I'll tell you <u>what</u>, after he's got his jollies, ten, f'teen minutes, I'll come down here, give you a shotta <u>this</u>  stop your heart, an that's <u>you</u> done, an there's an <u>end</u> to it.  What do you say...?  I know you got lotsa money, evabody says so.  I know how that stuff works, take it out, move it <u>around</u>...  ...stay with me now, <u>fuss</u> with it... Whatsay we call your banker now, tell him a <u>code</u>... move that money to me, he <u>confirms</u> it, and I fix you up Right Now...  Whatsay?
Let the girl go.
He requests your presence, once again, as part of...
Well, well, well, well, well, she went <u>in</u> there, to apprehend a Dangerous Felon. Went in there with her gun, Came out, <u>without</u> the Felon, with<u>out</u> the gun...
...she couldn't act on her own..?  Where is the FBI's vaunted Initiative, where..?
How's your <u>child</u>?
And how do we account for the interest of such a charming man, an interest in Torture?
...should love to correct your error. 
And what was the trip <u>before</u>...?
Could you tell me:  did you ever meet your predecessor, Dottore Fanelli...?
I know that the officers who first investigated his disappearance searched for a <u>note</u>, a farewell note, a suicide note...
You assemble this, on the instant, from these few observations?
I wonder no longer.  You were out of the country.
I <u>sense</u>...  The faintest <u>whiff</u> of a perfume, whose <u>base</u>, whose <u>base</u>, whose <u>base</u> is "Hamamelis" ... it is <u>witch-hazel</u>--such a clean scent.  No, not a European scent. I would say it is a scent of the New World.  I would say, you have been in America.  Have I struck home?
If such there breathe, I'm sure you could <u>unearth</u> him...  Your reputation does you honor. 
Take mine.  Ah. And is that your <u>wife</u>...  Signora.  Can it be that you are lovelier, even, than at our last encounter...?
We got KittyKat...
Oh, no, no.  It won't be <u>that</u> long.
...get outta my way, you sonofa<u>bitch</u>...
Spoken like a Protestant.
Thanks to <u>you</u>...
...we were speaking of my <u>father</u>...
...and my need for The Institution...
And how did he do that?
...but will that satisfy you?
<u>Yes</u>.
...what has she done to harm you...?
Well.  <u>Excellent</u>... I'm...
What else's he goin to do with his day, he can't work, and he won't steal...
No, that is code-word material, that's what <u>that</u> is....
The Multi-Jurisdiction Task Force:  read alphabet soup, for the continued pursuit, and in preparation for the apprehension of the fugitive, Evelda Drumgo.  The man's hazing you.
What broke <u>you</u> free, Girl?
...something about my <u>father</u>...?
You got a lot of people love you, Starling.
Y'want to gimme Brigham's pistol?
Why?
...and that is what you need to expand.
What shape is the scar?
It is a gravestone in the cemetery of ______ in my native Florence.
....this is perhaps an inappropriate <u>time</u>... but, I would like to say, it is an honor to meet the Woman who <u>solved</u> the celebrated Hannibal Lechter...
No, I don't <u>think</u> so...
What does <u>that</u> mean?
Yes.
...yes...?
When?
I've come to see you, sir, about an Auction...
Large resources, Starling, which I prefer to devote elsewhere....
Isn't it funny?  You can look on my face  which you would grant me, is the most hideous sight you will see in what I hope is a long life. You can look at me.  Which shows  a Strength which <u>must</u> come from strong  strong convictions.   But you <u>shy</u> when I say the name of God.
I have not, I would <u>not</u>.  For life  life goes on Starling.  And, wait, wait, I wish to <u>talk</u> to you... I'm...    One moment.  I was <u>afflicted</u>, do you see, but my affliction was not in my meeting with your Dr. Lechter.  I was <u>afflicted</u> before. Before.  Do you see?  In my arrogance. Do not  Do not curse God when you are humiliated.  Listen to me: <u>embrace</u> it, and you embrace <u>life</u>.... <u>Listen</u>, and you hear the word of <u>God</u>...
That's it, Adam, pretend it's one of those arcade things, the tighter you squeeze, the more of a man you are...Ooh, that's it.
Yeah, his lack of intelligence. Sorry, Wendy, but as learning disabilities go, stupidity is often overlooked.
I'm not really a--Does it count if...
Say Hi for me.
Why am I so--That's new--The way I figure it is if I can get through to just one camper...then I'm a pretty incompetent counselor.                                           ] Don't get caught. I'll deny                                 ] everything.                                                 ]
Your Secret admirer?
Stop, stop...I'm willing to put my mouth where my mouth is...I throw one overhand pass and Todd catches it-- dramatic pause--You let me go down on you...
Yeah, an insane female gynecologist! Hayley, don't listen to her.
Nothing.
When did pretending to be bored become a sign of superiority?  Are you mad at me for giving the cabin new haircuts or are you just still miserably pining for Wichita's lightning rod?
Clever observation. Go back to Wichita.  Oh that's right, you can't.
Talia, you're a wonderful person...
Yeah, we talked about sex, too. Oberon must be sweating in his sleep.
Gosh, this is really a great conversation--I can't believe I said that out loud.
It's okay, there's a lot of things I don't believe in...
Iunno.
Don't worry, you...
Stop!  Stop it, this afternoon was not what you thought...I overheard you and Pixel, at the side of the mess hall, your idea about the "test"...Do you believe me?
I'm just thinking I'm glad I broke up with everyone I ever went out with.  The swelling is gonna go down, right?
No. Fuck no. If you met yourself as a child, would you hug her and say everything's going to be okay...
That's bullshit. Just shoot.
In my heart, Heather's still alive.
Like last night, Veronica?
I'll think about it.
Don't tell me. Crest would be stained with loserness.
You goddamn bitch!
Color me nauseous.
King David.
Well, you better move Holden out of the way or he's going to get spewed.
You are out of control. Heather and Kurt were a shock, but Martha Dumptruck, get crucial! She dialed suicide hotlines in her diapers.
People love you but I know you. Jennifer Forbes told me the petition she signed was to put a jacuzzi in the cafeteria. And Doug Hylton...
Give me the clipboard.
Suicide is a private thing.
But what about Heather and Ram and Kurt?
Sure.
How very.
No, but if you're nice I'll let you buy me a Slurpee. You know your 7-11speak pretty well.
Really? That thing in the caf today was pretty severe.
I didn't. Cherry.
I don't really like your friends either.
Then let's just concoct ourselves a little hangover cure that'll induce her to spew red, white, and blue.
Man Veronica, pull the plug on that shit. I say we go with Big Blue.
Yeah, great.
Chick-en.
Like a suicide thing?
"To me though, suicide is the natural answer to the myriad of problems life has given me."
Yeah. Scary stuff.
They used them on themselves to make it look like they were dead. Really quite a brilliant device, but too flamboyant to seriously produce.
Did not.
I was just making it more special.
You kids are making too much damn noise.
I was thinking more along the lines of slitting Heather Duke's wrists open and making it look like a suicide.
I don't get it! You were wrong! I was right! Strength, damnit! Come back!
Nag, nag, nag, nag. nag.
What in the hell do you think I'm doing? Taking out her tonsils?
You didn't say Simon Says.
You're not listening. People are going to look at the ashes of Westerburg and say there's a school that self-destructed not because society didn't care, but because that school <u>was</u> society. Is that deep or what? I'll let you put it in your diary, babe. Free of charge.
Just push the red button twice. That's what stops it. If that's what you want, babe?
May<u>be</u>.
Get a job.
But my name's not...
Stained with loserness. Oh, I like it. Can I use that. It'd be dynamite on interoffice memoranda.
What's that?
Are you a carpenter, Mr. Rieper? HERBERT shakes his head.

Come on through.

Well . . . I better make myself a bit more presentable.

It's a letter from the school . . . from Miss Stewart.
I care . . . your father cares . . . we want you to have a good education.
These stories are not going to get you School Certificate! You don't seriously think anyone's going to publish them?
Well, actually, Mummy's left that programme now . . she's far too busy with The Marriage Guidance Council.
Oh, no . . . Mummy's awfully good at it.
I'm the Matron's favourite patient and she's shown me her special stitch!

I'm sorry, Mrs. Rieper. I'm feeling quite fatigued.
Hello, Juliet. Juliet take off her jacket.
It doesn't matter.
Daddy says the Bible's a load of bunkum!
Saint Mario!
This . . .
That was what we were led to believe . . .
Don't worry, Gina! Mummy and Daddy love each other.
Mummy!
Your mother is a rather miserable woman . . . isn't she?
Let's go for a walk down here . . . come on, Mummy!
It's the morphine Trevor. You're on so much of it, you could be asleep and dreaming even with your eyes wide open.
You came in for your EEG. You fell asleep and well, I took the liberty of...I'm sorry. You looked like a wreck Trevor.
Some call it resilience. Others, stupidity.
All finished.
I'm stumped.
Oh I knew about the chairs already. This is where the emphysema patients come to sneak cigarettes.
Did I ever talk about Kirsty?
If it makes you feel better that took every ounce of self control I had. Trevor, I never date patients.
Look never mind. Just get some numbers going- any numbers at all will due. The hills have eyes remember?
Almost that fast. I got a few loose ends to tie up first. Came into a shitload of money recently. I've always wanted to go to take a trip. We're just gonna walk into the airport and decide right then and there.
Allison Dormere. Your intern.
I said she's been missing for-
What's the difference?
Zero's a number right?
Sorry I just kind of... spaced for a second there.
Gwen, my wife's dead.
But... I thought...
This isn't happening.
There is no wisdom, no insight, no plan 
Really, why's that?
For me? Trevor! How romantic! Come here, you.
It's perfect.
Where's my wife?
Where is she? Where is my wife?
A little? Try unbelievably.
I don't know who you are or what you want. I just want to know what's under that sheet...
Shh. It's okay son. There is but one truth. One thing you can be absolutely sure of. And that thing is this:
In bad weather, yeah.  Mostly I camp out in the woods.  I thought maybe you were down on your luck too when I picked you up.
I was in the can, for Chrissake.
I'm beginning to... be aware of that, John.  Listen, I'm not gonna do nothing heroic here, you can trust me on that, buddy.  Whaddaya say we just sit down for a while. I don't have no tricks, I'm not that smart.  You could, like, rest up for the jump.
And give a deposition to the jUdge.
I... I'll do the best I can, Bernie.
I think our best course right now would be to focus on the Probation Officer's report...
Are you pretty involved in his upbringing?
How recently?
"Angel!"  I didn't say "angel," that's a little strong.  Listen, here's the thing, I gotta get over there to the TV station to collect my million bucks.
'Cause I'm up to my ass in shit is why.  I'm broke, plus I got legal problems... Nobody was asking for me, huh?
My attorney, she's just outta law school, about a couple of years older than my kid, for Chrissake.
The thing about kids is, they're so... young!  They don't know nothin' yet.  When you're a kid, you think you're gonna grow up an' be a "wonderful person" instead of an asshole, like everybody else.
You couldn't have a problem, Chick, because I personally have got them all.  I cornered the whole goddamn market.  You wouldn't believe... Oh, how ya doin'...?
I had to explain your tendancy to "exaggerate", How you were actually "in country" all of two weeks and how you killed about as many people as the other clerk-typists in your outfit, no more, no less...
Camera, Chucky.  Are you Bernard LaPlante, sir?  What is your relationship with John Bubber?
What's your scheme, Mister LaPlante? What are you forcing John Bubber to do?  What are you -- ?
Me!
The cops!  What kinda bullshit is this?  Is this America or -- ?
If anything happens to John BUbber, Mister LaPlante I'm going to see you prosecuted to the full extent of the law.
Who am I?  You're asking me?  You're the big expert for Chrissake!  I'm what?  The "Scumbag," right?  The sleazebag something or other, the blackmailer, the...
Thanks.  Thanks, pal.
All the adulation?  It makes you feel like a fake, doesn't it?
Vietnam!
Gale...
And sold it to Mister LaPlante, the fence, who's now trying to blackmail poor John.
The story behind the story, the ugly scandal behind the falling millionaire, the dirt, you mean.
Would the station put me up at a good hotel...?
If you reach out, you could get pulled over yourself.
Said he's not an actor.
No, Deak, not a great story.  We backed this guy, he's our boy!  We gave him a vote of confidence, we gave him a million dollars.
An hour after...!  Deak, for Heaven's sake!  Let's give her a night in New York City.  We'll put her and her boyfriend up at a good hotel...
What about?
Call him back.  Ask him.  I'm a little...busy.
Nobody stole my credit cards.  They burned up in the crash.  Which reminds me, did you get me cash? And what about the reservations?
Listen, you can kick 'em, hit 'em, pour water all over 'em -- <u>nothing</u>.  I'm telling you, under ordinary conditions they're <u>quiet</u>, they're nice to have around, they're completely harmless -- but when you blow this whistle...  ... then look out.
Okay.
Oh -- uh -- girlfriend.
Well, I've been doing a little independent contracting, some carpentry here and there, y'know, do-it-yourself-type stuff.  I still find it very soothing.
I understand that.
It's not going to happen unless you make it happen, my friend. You're going to have to assert yourself a little bit more.  <u>Show</u> your affection.
<u>Ask</u> her how she feels.
Maybe I could take a look at it now.
It's a living.
I was alone a lot as a child.  No one to compete with.  My parents ensured that I found happiness in the smallest things.  When you're all alone it's your own world, you don't have to take orders from anybody.  You don't necessarily believe the stories people tell you.
Can I tell you tomorrow?  I think I...
Bye, Neil!
Why are you mad at each other?
No, I told you.  A whiff of perfume on his shirt.
He'll never appreciate it more.
I can't help it if my homework is torn to shreds three times a week by someone <u>much</u> bigger than me</u>.
The pocket's a cinch -- I'll sew it up for you after dinner, okay?
He's staying with a friend.  Hurry up now, you'll be late for school.
Mom, I heard someone downstairs!
No, thanks, Mom -- I'll go up to bed now.
High end?  Honey, it's a whole new budget.
You wanted furniture too, didn't you?
Honey, are you okay?
All new houses have noises.
He's made some friends, hasn't he?
I know someone else who's sensitive.
Someone nice will find him if he gets lost.
I don't care, Philip.  You want to go chasing Barbara Zelman, go ahead.  Just watch out for those buck teeth.
Did she water this plant?  It looks a little bent out of shape.
I'm having the floor fixed,
Oh, yes, well, you know, when developers remodel a house they often overestimate their costs at first.  It's not like it's been marked down or anything.
Sometimes they prefer a quicker return on their investment.
Shut up.
What for, dickweed?
Grow up, Dreyer.
Why?  I just read your report card.  What's the point?  Stay home, watch some television, we'll get "Mad" magazine delivered.  What kind of report card do you call this?!
-- A man.
No.
Promise.
Really.
Parker.  We found him knocked out in the can.
They appear to be authentic.
Well, technically it's not mid evil - - it's Renaissance.
We sent the prints we lifted from the counter at the bank to the State computers, the FBI and interpol. Nothing.
Around.
Maybe he was a lousy shot.
Since we hardly know each other, I'm sure you'll understand if I hold one to it for awhile.
Aye.
No.  He was my brother.  He died at anothers hand.
I learned my fill from Romeriz.
That's all?
We cannot write our destiny, Macleod. In the end it could be you and me.
Me?  Of course.
It's done.
That doesn't matter.
Can you really tell from doing that?
She's a treasure she is.
I would like to say goodbye.
Where do you go when your mind drifts?
Any idea how big the cavern is on the other side?
I remember you.
I don't think we have anything to talk about, Miss Hillman.
Because it's my name.
About what?
You're twenty minutes late.
Why?
I wanted to get to know you better.
Not unless they're immortal.
--the crest of a lion and a dragon and a single word:  Courage.
Where is the film crew from the British Museum?
And this?
It does not come off as easily as the young ones.
Why did you wait?
I know.
Yes.
Good afternoon...  ... Shirley.
No.  The money, please.
I think he's dead!
It was stolen.
Jesus Christ, it's a clusterfuck.
I'll make the call.
Maybe Glen already picked up the disks.
He knows better than that.
It's happening right now.
Don't go Rambo and you'll tell'm about this on the back nine.  I'm gonna tie you up, then we're gonna take your car.
I'm going to my desk.
But if you stay in this house, I can promise you this --
You can't imagine the fucking you're going to get.
Shut up, goddamnit!  Just calm down!
Stop it!  They found the truck, Kev! They're already behind us!
That's crazy.  He's not going to kill us.
I'm not going to die for this!
We had an awful lot of shooting.  You need a doctor in there?
How about your two friends?  You don't have a man dying in there, do you?
Shut up and sit down.  You think someone's gonna make a house call?
Use more ice.
Give me an ETA.
You worry about your end.  I got my side covered.
Mr. Jones is dead.  So are two of his men.  The other three are in jail.  I have the disks.  I have Walter Smith. And you know what, you motherfucker?  I have you.
You said they would be here!
First my girls.  I get my girls, you get the other disk.
You sure?
What I want is to help my father.
We're hungry.  You're going to cook.
How about dog shit?
Keep your voice down.  I'm taking you and your brother out of here.
What are we going to do about Mike?
Get in the car.  <u>Now</u>.
Chief Talley is the one who got you out.
York Estates.  Four-five-five Castle Way. Anders and Jorgenson are on the way.
They might be at the house.  Keep trying and let me know.  I'm going to be here a little while longer.
Don't crowd the house.  The alpha's a kid named Rooney.  He's amped up and volatile.
Looks like you're bailing out at the right time.
And now I'm taking it back.  We're getting Smith out of the house.
I'm looking for you.  I need your tactical unit.
Don't question me, Captain!  This is <u>my</u> crime scene!
Contact the landlord.  I want to know employment, friends, family, anything we can find out about this guy.
They've been in there all day.
Thomas Smith.  I'm in the house that's on TV.  Dennis hit my dad and now he won't wake up.  You gotta help him.
They nailed the windows.  I can't get'm open.
I think he was working on them today, so they're probably in his office.  Could you find them and see who they belong to?
No!  They're right here --
A man has my family.  Gold watch here. Dark tan.
I'm the Chief.  I don't carry it.
You will re-assume command.  In two hours, a group of my people will arrive at York Estates.  You will tell the Sheriffs that they are an FBI tactical team.
You want . . . Marlon and Al.
Do you think I'm going to let you <u>murder</u> someone?!
What do you mean by that?
Do you know how to open the safe there?  Our government needs to use the hotel and the room keys are in the safe. You must open it.
Let me explain.
How many in your family?
I swear, Captain, one hundred thousand francs, enough for a house. I will get the money, you keep them outside.
Canadian Club?
Congratulations. You should spit in my face.
Watch everything? How? They are gone.
And what will they do with these satellites?
Indeed, general. Excuse me momentarily.
They can go where they want. They are in charge now.
If you do not help me, you will stay on that list.
Politics is power, Paul. And money.
You have no whiskey?
Take the river road back. It is clear.
Great.  No kidding, When will they be here? Excellent. Yes, call then.
What is it?
Good. I'd like to book a massage.
When will they be here?
Thank God.
Give me the phone.
Let me ask you Mr. Manager, do you notice a smell of cockroaches? If I were to leave this room, I'm sure I could find this smell. I know people who could cleanse it. But maybe it doesn't bother you? Why is that? Are used to this smell? Not me, I need a clean room to escape it.
I'm sorry, Mr. Daglish, this is the Mille Collines. No working girls here.
Why sir?
We are to meet Mr. Rutagunda.
He will be here.
No. But I make cards. Would you like me to make you two cards?
I need one last favor. Go back and get the twins.
I will give you my house.
Move? Where to?
The third floor are low class rooms.
We can't wait. We all go together or not at all.
Of course.
I couldn't help.
Please. Let them stay 'til morning. The militia will not come here, they know you are a Hutu with influence.
Dawn. Then they go.
Where are you hurt, son?
Stay with the children.
What are you going to do? You cannot drive them out onto the road. They can stay with me.
I will not have them on my conscience. They will stay in my room.
What for Paul.
We're running out of beer and other supplies.
Go out! Where?
Tell me what it was.
What sort of car?
Get on the truck, Tatiana.
What sort of plan?
What's wrong?
There is one thing I need right away.
Sir, Gregoire has been taking beers.
Thank you, Roger.
Go downstairs, I will help you.
-- "oh, no, Officer, I'm very much alive -- just a joke to beat my husband at his own clever game -- What? What do you mean he's dead? It's all my fault, I may as well have killed him myself!"
-- the James Dean wannabe with the hair trigger --
It was on my Dad's list of "things to do." But the House did him first.
Donald W. Blackburn, M.D.
Is she alright?
As a tumor.
-- fuck you!
Yeah, me too.
Nothing.
Hell NO!! The House will kill ya!
The...Fourth of July.
Over here!
An answer, I hope: exactly what -- or who -- Melissa was taping.
Back where?
Let's try down here...
He's dead...?
It's succeeding!
How'd you make your guest list, Price: throw darts at a phone book?
Oh. You think this is a request. Well, think again. I'm telling you: "Haunted Hill" is exactly where we're having my party this year. You'll find the guest list on your desk by the time you get back --
Finding ways for me to die at these things is really your deal, isn't it? The "O.J." knife with the not-quite- retractable blade? Your "Jim Jones Kool- Aid" that was exactly that?
My guests were shredded. It's your sick little scene now, Steven: enjoy. I'm going to go run scalding water on the places you just touched me, and then I'm calling a cab.
Sure it wasn't. Hey, anybody else here make their living with thrills'n'chills for the kiddies? Don't raise your hands all at once.
Must be getting old, Stevie -- you're repeating yourself -- this is the exact same set-up you used for the Son-Of-Sam Hunt back in '94.  Girlie, open up that casket there and see what you find.
A simple leak, if it's okay with you.
-- being utterly fucking useless, what else is new.
And then what happens?
I've designed and built six of these places -- take my word for it, everything's fine.
Sorry, Pritchett, here you go.
I think, Pritchett, we've got a situation here that even you can't explain away as "ghosts." This is ice- cold homicide by person -- or persons --
Or somebody wanting me to believe that.
I am.
-- confirming everything we already know --
-- no more --
Not even for a million dollars, Mr. Price.
-- it wasn't me.
I was just sitting here -- it happened. I had nothing to do with it.
Maybe it was just its time to finally fall apart.
-- guess we know where Mr. Price is now.
What's going on?
Well, then, how 'bout maybe we call someone?
I said we shouldn't come down here. Very treacherous -- physical and metaphysical levels, both. There've been no refurbishments to this part of the house -- it's exactly as it was in 1931.
This? This is nothing. You've only been dealing with the House itself. You have no idea what you're tinkering with. Sooner or later, the darkness that is at the core will get out... One of you will release it... Not meaning to, of course... then...  ...Bye, bye, Miss American Pie...
Keep talking, I'll find you!
It might have been her mother.
Suppose not.
Why don't you pass me your plate?
Sure.
We'll have every leprechaun in Ireland here honey.
We'll get it later.
Go to your room!  Now!
It's dark!  I can't breathe!
Don't be afraid!
Good night daddy.
I don't think she willed it to me out of sentiment.  She didn't even know who I was.  It's just... tradition.
She's asleep.  I think that's what I need, too. I'm starting to see things.
So what are you saying?
She's gone!
Should I...
What are you talking about?
Maura.
You'll have to settle for turkey.
Oh, that's nice...
I took pity on the poor woman. This house is too big for one person to live alone in...
Why?
Come back to us honey!
Well thank you for the offer,  But I really have to go.
So what does that have to do with Aubrey!  Where is she!
What are you getting at!
Oh.
Runic?
What?
You wanted a story.  You got it.  Turn on the TV now.  And then get your ass down here ...  ...
Of course tonight.  Is that a problem? Like, if you've got a guy there or something ...
Yes I do.  Terri, something awful happened to that boy.  I have to find out what it was.
No.  I buy them to impress people.  Of course I've read them.
On the contrary.  It has everything to do with the world.  And our dreams of how it will succumb to us.  You enjoyed the girl?
What!?  What are you talking about?  Why should I help you?
It has already begun.
Live and in the flesh.  How're you doing, babe?
Will you relax?  Your little girlfriend left a card, remember?
Not now, no.  I mean - now that you're here, it's like she doesn't even exist, you know what I mean?
Yes!  God, yes.  I ... I just want to hug you.  To hold you.  To tell you it's alright.
Ah, had the perfect amount of foam.  Just get me to the bar... It's the one good thing in my life that'll never change....
There goes five seconds...My record's eighteen.
Paint a woman in a lighthou--I don't want to steal a horse. Life is...
Oh, not much.  Gates just had his tonsils taken out.  The hard way.
Morning edition.  Seems two thieves "attempted" to steal it last night, but thanks to three "courageous" guards, it will be ready for tonight.
You sound disappointed.
"Maybe we're ragged and funny."
Don't worry, we'll get it...
"But we'll be the same as we started...
Yes way.
Snickers, make the list happen. Oh and it's one thing to play hide and seek with the Mayflower's pathetic staff, but we're sore losers.  I've put jumper cables on the nipples of children and not always in the line of duty.
As for our plan of action, anybody'd be insane to go in from the ground floor...
Actually we're in Italy, Snickers, she said as if it made a difference.
A little petting is not the issue!
Fantastic.  Perfection.  The Vatican extends its jealousy to the lucky bidder.
Sure Hudson.  Are you going to tell me why you did that back there or are you going to blame it on Dumbo?
Wow, you were "in the joint." "Doing hard time."  It's funny, but that excites me.  I seem to have a thing for sinners.
What are your plans for the weekend?  Hoisting away the Colosseum?  Tell me, did the devil make you do it or did Darwin and Minerva Mayflower?
It's that kind of selfish attitude that...
Uh, yeah.  Guess I'm a wee bit nervous.  I'm sorry I could only score clergy passports.
Trust Leonardo....
Sure.  Face down.  Two endearing shots to the back of the head. That's your mark, man.  What did Little Eddie ever do to...
Listen Hawk, this might be hard to believe, but I'm a regular joe.  I just want to be happy and happiness comes from the achieving of goals. It's just when you make your first billion by the age of 19, it's hard to keep coming up with new ones.  But now finally I got my new goal.  World domination.  With your help...Bunny....quit that!
You could host American Bandstand in here.  Why did you duck at the auction, asshole?
Whatever.  You own Boardwalk, you own Park Place, you own the four railroads.  You think you're God. For all I know, you're probably right.  I just wanted to have a damn cappuccino, maybe play some Nintendo after I find out what it is.  Man, why didn't you just <u>buy</u> the horse?  What am I saying, you did buy it...
If you're pausing for a "thank you," give it up.  So boss, you going to tell me what the crystal piece inside the pony means?
What job?
For God's sake, chain this convict.
You've got a dilemma, tiger.  I think I know what's going to help you solve it.
You can't, convict!  You're just a shmoe!  Every shmoe has the fantasy the planet revolves around them.  It rains, car crash stops traffic, you say "How could this happen to me?"  It's a natural inclination.  But for I, this isn't a fantasy, it is <u>reality</u>! You are on my planet!  You walk around the corner for coffee, out of my sight, you do not fucking exist!  The lives of shmoes like you have meaning only in relation to the rich, to the powerful, to ME!
Bastard!  If you were a true American.
Why George, you big softie...
Sharp.
With a little jazz.
The Hudswinger!
The Hudsucker Hoop!
We dumped the whole load. Now quit showboating, Addison --
Sure, sure, we'd all be millionaires. There's no point in looking back. At the time, Stilson thought dumping our position would panic the market, further depress the stock -- then we'd buy it all back, and more of course, once it got cheap --
Ah keeps the ol' circle turning -- this ol' clock needs plenty o' care. Time is money, Miss Archuh, and money -- it drives that ol' global economy and keeps big Daddy Earth a-spinnin' on 'roun'. Ya see, without that capital fo'mation --
Well, that even surprised ole Moses at fust. I didn't think the Board was that smart.
But then I figured it out: they did it 'cause they figured young Norville for an imbecile. Like some othuh people ah know.
Ten dollars? Let's grab a highball!
Not at all. You're light as a feather.
I myself --
Of course -- I went to the Muncie, uh, Secretarial Polytechnic!
-- or lack thereof?
Go on, tell the truth; I trust you and I put a lot of stock in your opinion.
Oh sure, you're biased -- you're a fellow Muncian. But would an imbecile come up with this?
...Why don't I just type this up...
Exactly. And I bet she's ugly. Real ugly. Otherwise, why wouldn't they print her picture next to her byline?
I understand that you're not very skilled yet in the secretarial arts. I'm not that skilled as president. Oh sure, I put up a big front --  -- not that everyone's buying it.
What do you think you were in your previous life, Amy?
Well, can I at least call you deer? Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Seriously, Amy, the whole thing is what your beatnik friends call 'karma' -- the great circle of life, death and rebirth.
We have to be realistic, Amy. You know things have slowed down a little here at Hudsucker --
Now, Aim --
Oh Norville, I --
I want a martini! On this bar, right now! I've had a martini in every bar on the way down here, and I'm not about to --
It's the most beautiful t'ing I ever saw.
Well, I --
I like to think so! It's this little idea I been working on!
Geez, I'm sorry, buddy --
Nah, that's all forgotten.
Say, that was a swell idea!
Well, why don't ya read it.
Yeah?
But, sir! --
Lobby. We haven't got all day.
Damnit, where's my car!
-- So if you think it's appropriate, I'd like to bounce the idea off a few people at lunch --
Sure, sure, it's a tough course. Well thanks for coming, kid. I thought the board room would be a swell place to chat undisturbed -- it seems we're having some security problems here at the Hud.
Old Faithful.
Thank you for waking me.
We'll see if we can't make her well, Alma, you and I.
A puff-up, I call it.  But Miss Jessica always says "brioche."
You mean a figurehead.
But they came to a beautiful place, didn't they?
You've never said anything about voodoo before, Mrs. Rand.
I don't mean believe, like believing in a religion.  I mean, do you believe it has power?  Do you think it could heal a sick person?
I heard the servants talking about someone called Mama Rose. They said she had been "mindless"...
I don't know.  I prefer to think of her as a sleepwalker who can never be awakened -- feeling nothing, knowing nothing.
Very well.  That means that you have met all Mr. Holland's requirements.  Now, as to salary -- it's quite good -- two hundred dollars a month.
I'm afraid I'm not able to tell you much. Only that the patient is a young woman -- the wife of a Mr. Paul Holland with whom we do considerable business.
No, this is quite final.  You see, Mr. Holland is a sugar planter.  He lives in St. Sebastian Island in the West Indies.
That's rather nice, isn't it?
We're half-brothers.  Paul is mother's first child.  When his father died, she married my father. Dr. Rand, the missionary.  And you know what they say about missionaries' children.
Mr. Holland?
It's my day off.
I don't know.  I once asked Dr. Maxwell the same question.  He said he thought she was like a sleepwalker who would never waken.
You can't really believe that.
Yes.  But it was once the figurehead of a slave ship.  That's where our people came from -- from the misery and pain of slavery. For generations they found life a burden. That's why they still weep when a child is born -- and make merry at a burial.
Nothing -- really.  But you must admit it's an eerie sort of place -- so dark --
Mrs. Holland must have been beautiful ---
Don't.  It will save you a great deal of trouble and other people a great  unhappiness.
Good morning.
I love Fort Holland.
You didn't drive her mad.
It's more than that, Doctor.  I've entered into their ceremonies - pretended to be possessed by their gods...
I hated myself.  I kept saying to myself over and over again that these people had no power; they had no strange drugs; that there is no such thing as a Zombie.
Yes, I said it, and I made myself believe it. But when I got here, Jessica was already raging with fever.
But I had no thought of harming her.  It wasn't I...
Of the nature of Mrs. Holland's illness.  And, of course, the events which led up to it.
Emotion tricks all of us, Mrs. Rand.  And you are a woman with a very strong conscience.  That conscience has been tormenting you. The rest is coincidence.  There is no such thing as a Zombie.  The dead do not come back to life. Death is final.
Gotcha George, not a problem. Tomorrow. Hey, you want to start covering the old filmed entertainment sector yourself?
Well, hey, isn't that a one-in-a million coincidence. A real dreamer, Jim Williams, eh?
No thank you. We should be off.
I wasn't star--
Why shouldn't she be?
It's you Ben who needs to talk. I've had my say, and I'm waiting to hear back from you.
You know Elena, I've been thinking--
No, I didn't mean to sound negative. It was -- But Ben.  What is going to happen with us? Have you --
That shirt?
Leave it -- I'll wash it for you.
That one.
What's on your mind? Don't --
Listen, Elena, if you're gonna pull that passive aggressive stuff on me again --
Sure I do. Do I know what loneliness feels like? Sure I do. I know a lot about it, if that's what you mean.
I know, I know. I had no idea --
Yeah, well, if we'd understood we could have invented some kind of excuse. A key party -- did you see how stuffed that bowl was already?
Sure. I'll try. And we'll talk in the morning?
Hey guy. Things ok up there? You all right?
You're boring me. I have a husband. I don't particularly feel the need for another.
You should probably get dressed. The boys will be home soon.
After the Thanksgiving I had, I need it. You having one?
Jimmy? Jimmy? I don't know how to take this. And what do you mean, Jimmy? I thought you said you and your husband --
Get to sleep young lady -- and I mean it.
If I were a fascist I would have sent you to one of those Southern military academies a long time ago. Now get to bed.
That's besides the point.
Advice? I'm supposed to be getting the stock tips from you, Ben. Unless - have you quit your job? They fired you?
-- Waiter! Where's my cobb salad?  You want advice Ben? If your big brother were still alive I'd have him go out into the back yard and beat some sense into your head. Look kid, you married that woman against my advice --
Jesus, Benjamin, you're still as gullible as ever.
Well, maybe they have one of those filter jobs in the kitchen --
What the hey. Let's go for a drive.
Maybe you just need -- look, can you wait here a sec, I need to tidy up -- just a minute, I'll be right back. You'll wait?
Yeah. You?
Hi Wendy.
Just bundle up. It's supposed to freeze tonight. We'll see you in the morning.
Educated guess.
Yes.
They say you never forget.
Pharmaceutical! You are a god.
Yeah, Paul, are you gonna get home okay?
Let's see!
You going to tell dad?
You know, it's the whip -- the one uncle Frank got me from Mexico.
Sure I do, you know, like your aura. That you give off.
That's good, because I don't think Libbets is capable of the sex act.
They did it last year too. It's like traditional or something. They've got this humongoid Park Ave apartment and she just holes up there with a wad of cash.  Aren't the hugely wealthy sad?
Sure, anything but this English.
Yeah. When it freezes, I guess that means the molecules are not moving. So when you breathe, there's nothing in the air, you know, to breathe in to your body. The molecules have stopped. So it's clean.
Then why'd you come after me?
I don't know.
Huh?
Charles. Have you been keeping out of my shit? Have you refrained from entering the sacred precincts of my room?
Greetings, Charles.
Dad's like doing his Up With People routine, mom hasn't been saying much.
Yeah well wait till mom opens her mouth.
Libbets? What kind of a name is Libbets?
What are you doing at home on a Friday night?
The ones you built?
If it wasn't raining we could take him outside and blow him up.
That's nice. Are you drunk?
Detective Dormer's not leaving for a few hours.
But they're so boring.  All small stuff.
We already did.
The Puffins and the Hawks.  We're in extra innings.  The Hawks have a really good line-up this year.
I don't remember.
Don't worry.  I'll have a cool scar.
Where is he?
We just gotta catch the bastard, right?
Right.  Got lost in the rocks.
Has her books in it.
No.
First I need a copy of the key.
What?
And something else that might interest you.
One of the paperbacks we found in Kay Connell's knapsack.
I.A.'s calling themselves the "Corruption Task Force."  Can you believe that? Trying to root out any mistakes or "oversights" any other Detectives may have made over the years.  They're turning it into a witch hunt.  Something on the news about it practically every night.
When's that, a week?  Two weeks?...  We have to figure out a plan of action now.
You know I remember that.
That's not what he thinks.
Me and Hap.  A year and a half ago.  I knew the second I met Dobbs that he was guilty.  Smug, cold.  Dead eyes.  We had circumstantial evidence, but nothing to tie him to it.  Nothing concrete.  Went over every inch of that apartment.
Huh?
Ran like hell to go to him...
You're not missing much.
Who was Kay seeing besides Randy Stetz?
Who?
What was it?
But she was an attractive girl.
Yes.
I gave her things she didn't have. Couldn't have.
He.  Well, he...
It was when I went to kiss her.  She started laughing.  I got angry.  After all I'd given her.  All I'd shared with her.  I just wanted to make her stop. That's all.
No back-up.
Surely you know the one who made you...
He knew nothing. He just didn't care.
Yes... My God...
Follow me - that way - through my cell -
Louis, I can't save her. I will only risk losing you -
I knew. I rescued you, didn't I? From the terrible dawn.
It's bet in the beginning, lest the death takes you down with it. yes, that's it. My child. My beloved child.
Yes you are, my dearest. You are mine and Louis' daughter. You see Louis was going to leave us. He was going to go away. But now he's not. He's going to stay and make you happy.
Oh, Lestat. I must do more than that. I've brought a present for you.
Drunk on brandy wine. A thimblefull. I thought of you when I saw them.
No. Laudanum.
Don't mock, Claudia...
Then maybe so do we. Every night of our lives. He was my brother. My maker. He gave me this life, whatever it is.
And you never cried -
Not yet.
You are more beautiful than any of them.
Yes. Should I take her, Louis? Among her dolls? make a doll of her in turn?
What danger?
That's not so.
I can't go through with it, I tell you.
Yes...
I want a woman.
And if I don't?
Fascination...
Anything is possible. But just try it for a week. Come into New Orleans and let me show you some real sport!
But how do you know?
I don't know any hell -
Come the New Orleans then. There's an opera on tonight. A real french opera! We can dine in splendour!
Where do you think, my idiot friend? We're in a nice filthy cemetery. Does this make you happy? Is this fitting and proper enough?
You remember how you wanted her, the taste of her -
Don't worry, Louis, you're conscience is clear. You left her alive.
That's enough, cherie. Stop before the heart stops.
We can't begin this way. Let me turn on the light.
Coffins... coffins unfortunately are a necessity...
He was dead to us. We were free. That was all that mattered.
If I could see what you've seen, feel what you've felt I wouldn't let it end like this! You need a like to the world out there, a connection... then it won't end like this...
Built in 1948 for a member of the Rockefeller clan. The tile work was imported from Spain. A lot of history in these walls...Judy Garland stayed here...Hemmingway fished for marlin right off that dock --
It's our version of winter.  201 and 202. There's Scrabble and Parcheesi in the lobby. Enjoy.
Not possible, I'm afraid. The last ferry left hours ago. And we got a storm coming. There won't be another one for days.
Phones went down a few minutes ago.
No.
Up-tighteous and self-righteous.
What are you doing in my closet?
Julie, people who end up making rules like that end up beating their kids with wire hangers. It's a fact.
Would you relax? We've been dating three months. He ain't stalking your butt.
Some.
Hey, slow down, turn off the little motor up in there...What do you say we go to the gym and work off a little stress?
Karla, I just wanted the whole thing to be over. I didn't want to involve anybody else.
Come on, you can make it.
You're okay. Thank god.
Oh, that's Will. He's a friend. You'd like him.
Can't what?
It's not like that. It's not you. It's me. My head. I want to go back. I want to be with you. I want to be fine. I want everything to be like it used to be.  It just isn't.
No, you don't have to be sorry. I'm the one --
I told you.
I don't know.
I'm fine.
What?
Fumes build up in the fuel tanks. You can by surface-to-air missiles over the internet. Planes use O-rings...which freeze in tap water. Planes fall from the sky for practically no reason at all.
It's...him.
It's my fault. I shouldn't have...I didn't think...
It's in my room!
Julie, you said you were tired. Waybe you were dreaming.
Did you get help?
Me, me, me. It's always about you. I'm having bad dreams. I can't sleep. I'm not doing well in school. I'm having trouble with my boyfriend.
I'll talk real slow.
Where there's a Will, there's a way. Come on.
Honey, some folks just can't fly.
We will, baby...All this means is we got the whole island to ourselves.
Hello?
I don't know, but I'm starving.
He's probably the only one who can help us.
I'm not waiting...So give me the gun and keep the ring.
Not anymore.
Julie thinks there's a dead guy in the closet.
Must have missed the sign.
See, it's not a macho thing. It's about equilibrium in your inner ear. You could've used a patch, but it's too late now. Get used to it.  Some folks just can't sail.
So why are you still here?
They're all dead...Dead, I tell you.  Ahhhh, we're all deaaaddddd. Tyrellll, joinnnn usss.
What is up with that weirdo?
Or even spirit messages from the next world.
He won't even know you're there. He is delirious.
Go ahead. I'll wake you up when I go to bed. Then you can watch him.
Very well. I'll wager a dinner.
I just came to see if your prayer would entertain me as much as my medicine seems to amuse you.
My friend -- what can one say --
How could we go back to the wars with such pleasant company here..
Poor Cathy --
I don't know now without my father.
Whet do you mean?
You were father's secretary -- I never thought - -
) But Thea -- She stands in your way. I know you. I know your little hints -- the way you can turn the truth into a lie --
That your father and I --
This is Dr. Drossos, chief medical officer of my division.
Yes?
Miss Wollsten -- my secretary, she'd know.
She's not too well.
I heard the same sound at Ladysmith, at Nukden, Port Arthur.  What do you expect after a battle?
We have no time for that.
In a way -- this girl, Thea. You must stay away from her.
Listen to what I say --
You see? Thea believes it, too!
The General threatened me.
He keeps asking for the name of my father and mother.
It is more than a feud between two families. He stole my mother away from her people.
It is for that he hates me.
Well, you're begging, and that's a whole lot worse.
Then foreclose!
What did . . .
Well, I guess they do those things. Well, I trust you had a good year.
Well, who are you, then?
Oh, that's right, I keep forgetting. Comes in pretty handy down here, bub.
I found it out a little late. I'm worth more dead than alive.
Well, I had a car, and it was right here. I guess somebody moved it.
You'll see a lot of strange things from now on.
Zuzu's petals.
Oh, I'm not sure of anything anymore. All I know is this should be Bailey Park. But where are the houses?
Yes, George?
Where is she?
Sit down? What are . . .
They went out of business years ago.
Hiya, George!
Oh, look at this. Champagne!
Because, you know, sir, he's got the I.Q. of a rabbit.
Yeah, all right. Now, I'll paste this together.
Nice girl, Mary.
Oh, stop that grunting.
Can you give me one good reason why you shouldn't call on Mary?
Well, I've got eyes, haven't I? Why, she lights up like a firefly whenever you're around.
And besides, Sam Wainwright's away in New York, and you're here in Bedford Falls.
Uh-huh.
Hope you enjoy it.
No, no, Martini. Your boss. Where is he?
I wonder what's eating that old money-grubbing buzzard anyway?
He's pretty young for that job.
Maybe you were born older, George.
Very funny. Very funny.
Oh, wait. Wait . . . Wait a minute.
Hiya, Marty. Well, it's old home week.
Aw, come on. Be a sport. Just dance with her one time and you'll give her the thrill of her life.
Yeah -- yeah . . . sure I will.
I'm not going to go, George. I changed my mind.
Every cent of it, and it still was less than we owe.
They're not my children.
You like it? I'll send you a box.
Well, what about the Building and Loan?
All right, sir.
Huh? Yeah-yeah-yeah . . . soybeans. Yeah.
That so? Well, I'll tell him. Hey, that sounds great! Oh, baby, I knew you'd come through. Now, here's the point. Mary, Mary, you're in on this too. Now listen. Have you got any money?
Well, now listen. I want you to put every cent you've got into our stock, you hear? And George, I may have a job for you; that is, unless you're still married to that broken-down Building and Loan. This is the biggest thing since radio, and I'm letting you in on the ground floor. Oh, Mary . . . Mary . . .
I'll take chocolate.
Hello. You look at me as if you didn't know me.
Neither am I.
I guess I'm not quite the football type. You . . . look wonderful. You know, if it wasn't me talking I'd say you were the prettiest girl in town.
Well, then, sit down.
Oh, it's just marriage in general you're not enthusiastic about, huh?
Mary . . .
I feel like a bootlegger's wife.  Look!
That does it -- come here.
Please, let's not stop, George.
Hi.
You have no idea what's happened to me.
Oh, no you don't. Harry, now, not my best Haviland.
Oh, shucks . . .
What the hell.  For you....
Someone pop your balloon?
Sean!  Listen!  Listen to me, Sean.
Back down!
Swim for it!
I could give you a dozen good reasons.
Okay, okay, don't say I didn't remind you.
Yee-hah!
We better go back in.
That's awful.
Shells and lobsters and stuff?
No big thing, we'll see who's out there, maybe picnic.
Listen to Andy, Sean.
Gangway, Turkies!
Anyone got another set of sails?
Hendricks.  I want to go over your reports and your Form 908.
I just made it up.  It means, "Get me out of there."  What the hell's that?
Abandoned?  It's a little early in the season for that.
Not the drugstore!
Shit -- I'm late for dinner... Close up, okay?
About an hour, maybe two.  Let's see -- I came on about eight....
You can't stop me.
Never mind that shit.  Just point.
Got it.
Okay, okay.
Not till next year.
Yeah?
Look -- I just got this from Phil Fogarty.  It was in the camera belonging to the missing divers. It proves I was right, all along.
Will you listen to this man? Will you just listen to him?  You really caused a panic on a public beach, you shoot up the place, God knows who could've been injured -- what if somebody de- cides to sue us?  That could ruin us.
You don't make enough.
After we've looked, we'll talk.
Come on, let's check the bite radius.
The Shark's mouth.
Sound?
Can't you tell?
As far as the office.
For me?
Nothing, huh?
Do you?
It was bad, wasn't it.
Fired me!  I'm not a hysterical man.  I'm responsible.  I know what I saw....
I try.  Goddamnit, I tried...Now, I'm tired...I can't keep fighting it...I'm too tired...I'm...I'm....
Turn in the car.  Clean my desk, explain things to our sons, then maybe get shit-faced and punch your boss.
Just one minute....
It's still a good idea.
Someone has to do something.
Martin, this is kind of an official meeting
10-4,   soon as I can raise him.
Last transmission said ten juve- niles.
Then nothing.  If you see him, tell him to switch to an operational frequency, or give me a status report yourself.
That's what he said.
What's daddy doing?
Oh, yeah.  So why aren't they doing it now?
Tide doesn't turn for three hours.
Help!  Help!
That's a crock of shit.
None at all.  I wonder what the Brebner twins are doing tomorrow night.
What's that mean?
Double nope!
The tide's running.  It'll take us to the light.
They'll be there when we get there. Might even have a fire started.
Wait a minute.  Promise me something.
That you'll put down a blanket.  I've got black and blue marks all over my butt, and my Mom's getting uptight about them.
Mike?  Our Mike?
I'll be right there.  Wait up.
Maybe you and Brooke could come over to the town beach....
I love it.
Coming about....
You going with Patrick?
Anyone want to go the lighthouse?
Yeah.  Go on, beat it.
Quiet!  Shhh!
Okay, okay.  Close your door.
I'm not in the way.  Andy, am I in the way?
Len, can I see you a minute?
What is it, 97 days?
Hope I make it through both.
Don't let him get you.  Just continue your patterns and pretend he's not around.
Honey, I gotta go.
I don't know.  I can't understand it.  Something's bothering them.
Look, Michael... you don't have to come.
Oh, yeah.  Very.
Michael, the sub's dead.
Yes?
No.
Hydrophobia...
I have to get out of here.
It's a shark's tooth!
That's just it, Michael.  We don't!
You two go!  I'll call Calvin!
But you --
I'm  fine.
Make this quick!
Thanks for helping.
You're a strange man, Mr. Hutton.
The water ski show!  We have to get them out!
Sure.
He's missing.
Depends on big brother.
Did you see me?!  Wasn't I terrific?
I don't know, what else is there?
Can hardly wait to do it again.
What, hon?
SEAN!
Hold still, damn it!
I am serious.
Now what?
Calvin said it was all right.
Well, we're not going to hurt it, old boy.  I say, love, is Flipper ready to go?
Kind of dull in there for you, isn't it?  Why don't you throw in another shark?
Oh...
How come you're so brave with all this stuff?
I'll remember that, my Lordship.
Five hundred yards.
So was Dad.
Absolutely.  The audience will stain their drawers.  I did.
That's what grandmas are for.
Sometimes my father puts me in his lap and lets me steer the Jeep.
Watch me, Grandma....
Yes, you can make sandwiches....
He was doing his job....
We need milk....
We need beer....
We don't have anything straightened out.  You're uptight about something ...what's wrong?
I don't know...You...I don't know.
I have work....
But it went away...We would have known....
I can't help it....
You have something to say about everything....
Bang sticks are like yelling at it....
He knows what he has to do....
You check it....
He heard that.
A small one...Your brother won't be here....
What's going on?
Mommy lets me....
The water's coming in...The water's coming in....
I'll miss you....
What?
Okay.
You're not a pain in the ass....
I have to get this finished.
I m not unhappy.  Frustrated maybe... Discouraged a little.  It'll work out....
First time for everything is the best.  After that you know too much and it's never quite the same.
I'm the captain of this majestic ship.  It goes where I take it....
I always listen to my feelings....
I'm not saying you're wrong, just that there are other possibilities....
One time I was flying supplies up the Amazon.  Went down in the jungle....
They took me to the chief, who took a long look at me, then took me in his hut....
It's wonderful....
A big one....
Why?
I'm sorry...I....
Give me a hand here for Christ's sake....
I have coffee in the thermos.
How come it bumps up and down when there's no road?
You're the man who drives the plane.
Get her started....
Good news travels fast....
What's that....?
It needs more time to charge.
She's a tough lady....
I'll get her.  Have a good Christmas, Matt....
Will you leave me alone...?
The females have eggs....
The readings suck....
They put bombs on dolphins....
Holy shit!
When I signed on....
Hoagie.
Half the pilots down here fly drugs ...He's always going off....
Maybe the gear crapped out....
You'll be the eternal tropo...The old man and the sea...Know the words to this one?  'Oh, the shark has pretty teeth, dear, and he shows them pearly white...'
I've got to get to her....
I'm the one who wanted to study it....
In a few minutes....
Here it comes....
Oh, Jake... 
I'm training to....
I'd have to manage a nookie parlor to do that....
Gone to Ben Masters' place.  Cow tipping.
Oh no--
Only me and Mom ..
We only got one .. He doesn't drive.
Oh, shit. Of course. The kid.  <u>Travis</u>. Find that kid and get the knife off him. He's gonna lie to you - but he's got it - so <u>get</u> it. Well, go on, get on with it. Whatta you staring at?
The <u>dogs</u>?
A professional, whining, con-person bitch with an ass the size of Africa ..
Since when did you drink diet soda?
I <u>am</u> stopping smoking ...
How'd you do it, old man?
A dollar? .. Not worth giving up for a dollar ..
O.K. and I'm not in love with this fukker? That's how I feel about him.
<u>What</u>? She's <u>blind</u>, Bro. You may as well ask one of these Beethoven guys on the piano?
I don't want excuses, I want that weird-looking stuff called "cash."
All but .. How <u>you</u> doing?
I never knew about the sailor the- ory, Ross. He might have that one little thing I need in his files?
Just makes to so God damned mad ..
Alright, she wasn't lying about the van. But it could have been <u>any</u> van? Any little foreign diesel? .. She's <u>blind</u>, Bro .. It's sad .. She's pro- bably lonely, and you're a nice guy to have around .. But you're getting far too far into the element, Brother ..
I'm not in here to apologize, John. I told you what was gonna happen & it's happened? "Good-bye, Princess," & the same night she gets attacked? That's a tough one to swallow, Bro?
I dunno what I'd do with your help. I've gotta take her out of there ..
I spose I'm drinking myself to sleep. It's Helena's Christmas songs .. they're really pretty ..
That, I couldn't tell you .. And don't worry about anya this crap, by the time you're back it's gone ..
No.
Once.
That's bullshit,
Maybe he's lying to you?
Wrong cabinet.
Well, her, it ain't. That bitch is blind as a blonde fucken bat.
I don't know. I guess she must have called him John? I'm mak- ing tea. Would you like some?
My hands?
I don't know.
I gotta admit, you're one of them. Just wish I knew what you meant by a "hollow car?"
Of course I would ..
There's no one "looking at you" .. There's hardly anyone in here. The only person looking at you, is me.
Yeah, that'll do .. Is that "Hamlet?"
No I'm not.
Then why didn't he kill me?
You find something curious in that?
Two or three years ago.
Suzanne? Very pretty. She was a semi- professional model. But a policeman's wife she wasn't. So one day, she just packed it and left. And his whole life went straight down the nearest toilet.
Don't mix very well with beer.
She's a doll. But I wish he hadn't brought her out here.
He's not that bad of a guy ..?
Alright, guys. We stop this <u>now</u>.
No, c'mon, Freddy, let's have this out & over. You know what everyone thinks? They think you're making a case coz you found yourself a nice piece of ass. And no one's blaming you for it, I hear she's worth the flowers. But don't come in here get- ting holy over us. Sure I put it in the paper. Coz I wanted to <u>stop</u> this bullshit. I don't want you drunk out- ta your head searching my office ag- ain. it's pissing <u>me</u>, & <u>everyone</u> off.
Don't annoy me, Travis.
One of the accountants.
And the egyptian cotton shirt that works with or without the jacket.  Tell me again, how was it left with Cush?
That's right.
Let's go.  I'll drive you. _ 45.
Don't worry about it -- I never told you what I thought of that memo either --
Listen to me, it's over.
You know I didn't ever want to hurt you.
Hey, man, tonight I'm going to teach Ray about jazz.
My son... my mind...
I appreciate that, because some of that stuff... you know, it was two in the morning and...
Sure. Yes. Medical, I don't know.
Hello?
Yep.  Have a good time at school, Ray.  Wish me luck.
Hi.
We will be fine!
Happy. He said "happy?"
Bye you guys. _ 88.
No no no.  I just underestimated her...  her temper, I guess.  Why are we even talking about this?
Same to you.
Why do you love me?
What --
You want...
I know.  I watched it.  I sort of know it by heart.
Oh please.  My need to make the best of things, and your need to be what, "responsible"... if one of us doesn't say something now we might lose ten years being polite about it. Why don't we call this next road trip what it is.  A nice long break.
Aw, shut up.  You had me at hello. _ 130.
Of course, medical! _ 42.
Of course I know --
Dotty -- this is not "guy.". This is a "syndrome."  It's called Early Midlife, About-To-Marry, Hanging Onto The-Bottom-Rung Dear- God-Don't-Let-Me-Be-Alone, I'll- Call-My-Newly Long-suffering- Assistant-Without Medical-For- Company Syndrome.  And if, knowing all that, you still allow him to come over, more power to you.
No kidding.  I looked over and saw the shadow of two curious shoes in the doorway of the kitchen.
That's the first time I ever saw him kiss a man, like a dad, wasn't that just... thrilling?  I mean, he must have been needing that.
-- well, Rod, your agent passed me a note before the show. He says that your deal memo has been signed by the Arizona Cardinals. Four years for ten-point-two million dollars.  Playing in the state where you grew up.
We decided to stay with you.
Told myself -- if he shows up, we'll stick with him.
It's either going to be Denver or San Diego trading up to take him.
I'll give it everything.
Said who?  Sugar?
Mmm.  Hmm.
Why not?
Fine.
Good deal, man.
How do I know?
No.  A real man does not shoplift the "pooty" from a single mom.
No.
Hey, that's my word, okay?
What's that supposed to mean?
Damn right.
Well, friends can tell each other anything, right? If we have our "friends" hats on --
Jerry Maguire.  SMI.
Well.  Good luck with that --
How sad --
Not a chance.
You okay?
I'm over it.  Now I want all my clients and yours too.
I've got the clients.  I've got the juice.
I'm not your brother!
We'll go to the zoo sometime. Okay? I think I might have some time on my hands.
Right up ahead, buddy --
Quiet!
It is truly, what's the word? Inspiring.
I filmed this the morning they left.
We have to help him.
Think.
Never had a doubt. Never did. Us Kirby men, we stick around, huh?
You couldn't have made that jump.
How would you have helped Eric?  He needs you, Paul. He needs us.
What about Eric and Dr. Grant?
DAD!
Thirty-thousand, I think. Closer to the top.
It won't hold!
The bones will be there when we get back. That's the nice thing about them. They never run away.  And besides, you got me into this. I don't intend to be alone with these people.
Baryonyx?
Ah yes, the first rule of academics. Publish or perish.
Goodbye, Alan.
A raptor claw. I use to have one. A fossil.
I stayed pretty close to the compound, Figured if anyone came to look for me, that's where they'd start.
Closer you get to the water, the bigger things get.
She's the one person I could always count on. And she's saved me more times than she realizes. I owe her everything.
The population will Stabilize eventually. They'll adapt to fit different roles.
Let's just say that through my business -- imports/exports, emerging markets -- I've made some friends in high places. In this case, the Costa Rican government.
It's no use, Dr. Grant. No use.
That cheap aftershave I send you every Christmas, you actually wear it.  I'm touched.  Sit down, sit down, what brings you to Mombassa?
Well, I'm a very well-funded old son of a bitch.  You go.
A true hunter doesn't mind if the animal wins.  If it escapes.  But there weren't enough escapes from you and me, Ajay.  I've decided to spend a bit less time in the company of death.  Maybe I just feel too close to it my--
Like if you shoot yourself in the foot?  Wouldn't matter.  You'd be dead  before you realized you'd accidentally pulled the trigger.
Because I didn't know!  I don't have the faintest idea what they're doing here.
When you have a lot of time to think, it's funny who you remember.  It's the people who challenged you.  It is the quality of our opponents that gives our accomplishments meaning.  I never told you how sorry I was about what happened after we returned.
It's the lawyers.  The lawyers are finally killing me.
You were right -- and I was wrong. There!  Did you ever think you'd hear me say that?  Spectacularly wrong. Instead of observing those animals, I tried to control them.  I squandered an opportunity and we still know next to nothing about their lives.  Not their lives as man would have them, behind electric fences, but in the wild.  Behavior in their natural habitat, the impossible dream of any paleontologist.  I could have had it, but I let it slip away.  Thank God for Site B.
Isla Nublar was just a showroom, Ian, something for the tourists, Site B was the factory floor.  We built it first, on Isla Sorna, eight-some miles from Nublar.
John . . .
Not without a shot of the nest.
Which one?
No.  Richard talked to his parents.
This is nothing like Austin.  Forget about it.
What?  Why?
You heard his, Dieter.  Find a new spot.  And remember, we're after herbivores only -- no unnecessary risks.
Rex won't be any different.  It'll come.
You've broken its leg!
The velociraptors.
Piss.
Why?
It's just fed.  It won't attack unless it's threatened.  Don't move.
Do me a favor.  Don't pretend for a second that you and I don't know the truth.  You can convince Time magazine and the Skeptical Inquirer of whatever you want, but I was there.
There are no versions of the truth! This isn't a corporate maneuver, it's my life.
Oh, God.
Our chance to do what?
DAMN IT, BE SURE!!
What's that?
Why did you come here?
Now's the perfect time.  The animal just fed, so it won't stalk us for food.  Predators don't hurt when they're not hungry.
It has to be temporary, something that'll break apart and fall off as the animal grows...
Current evidence seems to be to the contrary, wouldn't you say?!  GIVE IT TO THEM!
What?
Ian, nothing we observe will be valid if we're trailing along in the wake of an army.
Where's Ian?
None of that matters.  Our communications equipment's been destroyed.  If your radio and satellite phone were in those trailers that went off the cliff, and I'm guessing by the look on his face --
You're sure we have to?
What now?
Dodgson, Dodgson.  We got Dodgson here!  See, nobody cares.  Nice hat. What are you trying to look like, a secret agent?
I was wondering, how are you planning to beat the security?
Anybody at all.  Feel free to speak up.
Oh, you know, if it's alright, I'd like to stay with Dr. Harding and finish with the trike.  Is that okay?
There's only one way to be positive.  I need to see some droppings.  I have to see the dinosaur's droppings.
I'll catch up with you.  You can go with the others.
Oh my God.
They'll all be fine.  Who better to get the children through Jurassic Park than a dinosaur expert?
A carousel - - and a seesaw.  They all moved, motorized of course, but people would swear they could see the fleas.  "I see the fleas, mummy!  Can't you see the fleas?" Clown fleas, high wire fleas, fleas on parade... 
John....
Good!  Keep going, now.  The cable will terminate in a big, gray box.
If they died together, they lived together. Suggests some kind of social order.
Oh, Ellie, look.  They're noisy, they're messy, they're sticky, they're expensive.
They know very little about the Jurassic Period they know less about the Cretaceous.
Dilophosaurus.
It's my favorite.
- - which is called a gizzard, and it helps them mash their food, but what happens after a while - -
I don't know.
Okay.
Stick to my heels.
The shutdown must have turned off all the fences. Goddamn it! Even Nedry knew better than to mess with the raptor fence.
Why not?
Anti-nature.
No one could have predicted Dr. Grant would suddenly jump out of a moving vehicle!
Yeah.
That'll - it'd be a first; man and dinosaur all die together.  John's plan. 
- - shut up.
Juanito, if they pull the funding, that will really slow things down.  If they pull the funding that's going to slow things down around here.
Grant?  You'll never get him out of Montana.
And the concrete moats, and the motion sensor tracking systems.  Donald, dear boy, do try to relax and enjoy yourself.
No, we don't have any animatronics here.  These are the real miracle workers of Jurassic Park.
Thank you.
Tim, are you okay?
That's okay.  Listen, give me your hand.
"Thunder lizard!"
But - - my grandpa said all the dinosaurs were girls.
Tim, you're gonna have to let go.  I'm going to count to three.
You have no idea.
Machines hate you?
Kids get scared.
We gotta do something.
For today, I guarantee it.
I, uh, don't really know any.  We - -
The brachiosaur?  Thirty.
We clocked the T-rex at thirty-two miles an hour.
Wu?
No, I didn't hear anything.  No, we're okay.
I'll stay awake.
Well, on the tour - - the film said they used frog DNA to fill in the gene sequence gaps.  They mutated the dinosaur's genetic code and blended it with that of frogs.  Now, some West African frogs have been known to spontaneously change sex from male to female, in a single sex environment.  Malcolm was right!  Look, life found a way!
Okay.  Keep low.  Follow me.
Timmy!  The power is coming down, quick!
Chaotician, actually!  Chaotician!
Hold on - - this is no species that was obliterated by deforestation or the building of a dam.  Dinosaurs had their shot.  Nature selected them for extinction.
I don't blame people for their mistakes, but I do ask that they pay for them.
Thanks for the presents.
Turn it off, Lex!  Turn it off!
That was great!
Don't tell me you're still thinking of buying Casa de Psycho...
Logging? We'll need an environmental impact study for that...
Great.
You have a map.
You learn something new every day. Let's go.
I'm not sure I'd call them murder exactly. More like a couple of bar fights that got out of hand.
Some kind of emergency back at the Sheriff's Station. Four deputies shot... some kind of explosion... I don't know what's going on, but they're panicking back there.
_Krueger_...
Come on.
Your... client is being booked right now. He'll be in cell five.
That's right. Wasn't on any of the maps... we could barely see it through the underbrush. Place must've been abandoned for twenty years.
It's all right.  Now... we're going to need a really good head-doctor for this. Someone who can get up on the stand and tell the jury that our client is mentally insane and has been for years...  We'll go through a dozen doctors before we find one who's willing to testify for us.
I don't "rationalize" anything. I'm his lawyer -- he's my client. That's all.
You're obviously going through a critical moral dilemma. And you're putting up barriers against anyone who tries to probe your conscience.  But it is heartening to know that you do have a conscience.
Insomnolesence has been known to cause psychotic episodes... delusions...
There's a pizza place over on Market.
Me too. I'm drunk.
That's right. The murders in the eighties were never solved.  But... there were teenaged witnesses who said Krueger had the ability to appear in your dreams... and that if he killed you in a dream, it would kill you in the real world.
Great.	When can you do it?
My client... is dead.  But I think he's a free man.
What is it really?
What was the matter with it?
-- Small.
Did you?
-- In what sense?
I haven't got the energy.  I mean, I have to conserve my energy.
In a manner of speaking.
Yes.
Not today, Burgel.  Send one of your memos, write up one of your communiques, but for God's sake don't bother me today.
... My ... social situation?
No -- I just -- I feel a sense of obligation.  He was my friend -- if I can be of any help -- closing his affairs.
I know.
One of you must be mistaken.
Do you think people in the New Town care what happens over here?  This will always be the ghetto.
You won't have any trouble finding it.
I have no right to be, I know.  My experience with real life  is practically nil.
At the cost of others?  You accuse people of murder without trial -- apparently without irony.  Did you go to the Castle with Eduard?  Then you have no idea what really might have happened that night at all -- even before or after he got there.
I've heard of it happening.
First these nameless authorities were the root of all evil, now it's insignificant Burgel.  If indeed there was a mistake -- and a minor one at that -- you're suggesting someone went to a lot of trouble over something so trivial as to not matter at all.
No -- not this time.
-- Listen to me --
Wednesday.  We left the office together.
No, we said goodbye outside the building.  He went off, as usual, toward his house.
No, I suppose not.
You mean you've actually begun some?
It's all right to be sarcastic in private to us -- because we have a sense of humor -- but when we're up at the Castle we suggest you don't make a fuss.  It would spoil the not unfavorable impression you make in other respects.
When a scapegoat is needed, my friend ...
I had the grandest of financial plots in mind, the most malevolent of personal motives, conspiracy theories extending to every ... authority I could see.  And I find you.  A body snatcher.
Lying in the gutter where they belong.
He's the clerk who died last week. From the insurance department
-- How would <u>you</u> like to be in a horrible situation like that?
It doesn't matter.  It's too late for all of us.
Amerika for us!
Look Mr Denham - you're not welcome here. Just pack up your cameras and go.
To be quite honest, Mr Denham ... I find the whole idea to be quite reprehensible.
Now now, Ann! Try be to polite.
You - calling me a thief? Well, that's great, coming from a glorified grave robber! You break into the tomb of some dead Egyptian - the poor guy's happily enjoying the afterlife when suddenly his shit gets stolen by a bunch of light fingered limeys!
Value? ... Value?
It's ok.I know what you were feeling.
Leave it, Ann.
We offer ourselves at your service, Mr Denham!
Exotic lands, primitive people, dangerous animals ... That's what the public expect from a Carl Denham picture! Lead us into the mountains, Sir!
Yeah.
She was with you after she left Frank.
Well -- well I'm just back. And -- I must tell you -- something quite wonderful.
Please --
Yes?
Now there's a picture I'd like you to --
From the beginning I don't know why the hell he's messin with you. If he was me he'd know better. If he was even a city boy he'd know better. You're a whore Miss Daniel, that's the truth of it, right? Now somethin I'd like you to look at.
Here please.
Like for you to look for the man.
If you'll let me go I could tell them what --
I said yes, I see.
My name's John Klute.
I'm an investigator. I'd like to ask you some questions about Tom Grunemann.
Tom Grunemann. He wrote you some letters.
What about everything since?
Look -- I'm sorry -- I've led everybody wrong. I mean yes, I get those feelings, but that's just me, that's just feelings.  I'm sure this will amuse you; I'm scared of the dark. And sometimes I get shook up, I hear people or -- well, I'll come out in the morning and think someone's been prying at my mailbox, or there's a little -- trash outside my door and I wonder if someone left it there for -- do you see? -- things other people wouldn't even notice. Well that's not real, it's just nerves; it's got nothing to do with --
Most of them.
OK.
Tell me about Frank Ligourin.
No.
It was Jane McKenna who sent you the dumper.
No, I said what did you think.
Oh. No. Not that way. I'd say it was more -- I don't know --  -- too bad? Pathetic?
When?
Why?
I don't get you.
No.
Arlyn was a junkie; I'm not on junk!
Yup.
My God, I thought it was over. And here I am, daddy, right back at the start.
With Trina.
No. I was going to come up. I wanted to ask you to marry me. 
I don't think so.
They don't scare me any more.
Doesn't scare me. I think we could handle it.
No. I'm sore.
I could try Arlyn Page again. She saw much more of the Dumper than Bree Daniel.
Well as a matter of --
Yeah.
No. No mistake Pete. It doesn't prove who it was -- but proves it wasn't Tom.
Call-girls generally keep a book, you know, a list of their clients. Sometimes, if a girl retires, she'll even sell it worth good money. Jane McKenna had a black book; when she died it was stolen. I've been after it a long time.
Will the Company put up five hundred dollars to get Jane McKenna's list of clients?
I'll be sending you on a report tonight.
I want to know how Tom Grunemann got mixed up in it.
Did she talk about him to you?
Are you with plant security, Sergeant?
You knew the subject Thomas Grunemann. How well?
He called this morning from Tuscarora. Asked me to meet him at 3:00 at the downtown heliport. He's on his way to Chicago.
We have some very tentative circumstantial evidence of freeky behavior, but there's no evidence of murder - there's not even a body.
I left them here. I was doing some work here.
Lunch in a restaurant.
Ladies and gentlemen...
On earth.
That's right.  You're absolutely right...It's been a long time since I made French toast.
I'll call Thelma and remind her, okay?  Don't worry.
Uh huh...
Some of the brown stuff is still there.
I don't care.  I hate it.  I want pizza.
Yeah?
That's okay, pal.  Go back to sleep.  It's very late.
You mean for good?
Dad?
See you in the morning light...
Sure.
Sure.  Lots of times.
Boy, I bet you if mommy ever saw this she'd remarried you.
No, I did not.
I make thirty-one thousand dollars a year.
Yes.  Very much.
Your honor, I'm only examining the man's employment record.  He pretends to fitness when he cannot hold a job.
No.
I suppose...
Congratulations, Mrs. Kramer. You have just rewritten matrimonial law.  You were both divorced, Mrs. Kramer.
Joanna, whatever it is, believe me, I'm sorry.
Now listen, before you do something you'll really regret you'd better stop and think--
I heard you, Joanna.  I promise I heard you.
Yes...How's Billy?
He is...  You sat in that coffee shop across from school--
You want what?!
Ted, if you can't discuss this rationally--
Ted, do you love him?
Joanna, what the hell is--
Oh, God...Oh, my God...
Jim, I've got to go.  I'm already late--
I mean it Ted, you're running this one.
Jim, I appreciate what you're saying.  I mean it, but I really think Joanna's coming back.
Well, ah...I thought it over and I decided we're doing it Murray's way.
Are you firing me, Jim?
Sure.
Mmmmnph...I'll get you a cab...
What?!?
I've been offered a job in Washington with H.E.W.
I'm going to take it.
The judge went for motherhood straight down the line.
I can't tell you how sorry I am.
No.
Look, Ted, all I--
What d'you know about how Joanna felt?  You went off to an office every morning and you'd come dragging home at seven or eight every night and as long as dinner was on the table you thought everything was swell.
Got it.
Lenox Hill.  77th Street between Park and Lex.  The emergency number is 327-0800.
Maybe.  I said maybe.  What I mean is, ah...I don't think it'll really work out, but Charley seems to want it, so...
A moment.
Yes, Holiness.
But, I am in charge.
And you have horses? You love horses.
Here. We'll collect them.
No!
General Chiang.
Thank you. Please sit.
I am afraid.
Then, we shall meet.
Far, far away.
I miss my brother.
How many?
We do not know.
It is an island. American territory.
He warned about the future of Tibet.
When it is time.
The radio contact said one officer had died. Then he said, "The Chinese soldiers -- they are coming." And then, the radio went dead.
Tibet, at war? No. China is close, America is far away. After countless people die, China would still, always, be close. We will work with what we have.
I had relinquished doubt.
Thank you.
But you will always be here?
True.
But, surely, we are safe in Tibet. We don't believe in killing.
Ahh.
No, Holiness.
Do you remember the day I came to your monastery, when I was a baby? And you comforted me?
We cannot.
What would you do, Holiness?
Doubt is an affliction. Reliquish it. Accept.
Too young?
No.  Do you?
Thank you.
I'll need any and all topographic studies.
What the hell are you doing?!!
You're crawling around like a--
A spring trap!
I coulda shot you, you--
They don't really attack underwater and--
Is everything a big fucking joke to you?
It came from across the lake.
Then do it!!
I don't know!
Jack.  We've all seen it.  He's probably a hundred and fifty years old, he's bigger than an elephant.
We both know what they'll do.
You do?
Women's intuition.  Are there anymore?
That hurt my feelings.
What's going on?
And what if I tranq him Kelly?  He drowns.  You think about that?
What?  Oh as <u>if</u> I'm interested.
Oh, bullshit.
Can I tell them you won't go back in the water?
You're not okay, your leg's a mess.
Yes, it <u>did</u> seem prehistoric but I'm sure he just carried the thing for luck.  Not that it <u>worked</u>, obviously.  It probably somehow got lodged into his body.
Hank <u>says</u> he's sure.
I <u>told</u> you.
Well.  You don't have to <u>stay</u> out <u>here</u>, why don't--
I am <u>not</u> staying on shore.
I am going out on that boat and why are you picking on me, is this some kind of--
I'm sorry but you're...
In his defense, every primitive culture known to man deified them. He's a mythology professor, he thinks crocs are divine conduits.
Good.  See ya soon.
Excuse me?
What are you talking about?
Yeah.  I got some stuff for your cut.
It's okay.
Father's a surgeon.  I can even stitch in a pinch, wouldn't be a bad idea here.
What?  Why... people have been killed, I hardly think I'm having a good time, why would...  Does it show?
Night.
We seem to say goodnight a lot.
<u>That</u> <u>is</u> <u>it</u>!!
Look.
Back us in a little, we need to get a shot!
White perch.
Alright, Ms. Paleontologist.  I wanna know why that monster is here.  You got a theory?
Obviously I was wrong!
Did he say anything?
Is the dead guy in there?
Um.  No, no.  Let's go.
Well.  At wakes.
Was he swallowed?
We're staying in <u>tents</u>?
Yes, <u>camp</u>, I thought that meant Holiday Inn, I never heard "tents", will there be toilets?
And that's why he thinks they're Godly?
You think Jack's handsome?
Yes.
He said he knew Karate!
What?
I guess.
Absolutely.
Me too.
Else.
Kevin.  How's it going, what's happenin', family good, great, nice to catch up, get out.
I'd like you to check out this lake.  See--
Well on this one I'd like you to be.
I <u>tapped</u> you.
Wild guess.
It was just a quick thing which we thought was over, and and...
Why not?
Hot damn, Clarice.
Agent Mapp! Thank you!
Where?
I'll need the big fingerprint kit... and the one-to-one Polaroid, the CU- 5, with film packs and batteries.
Sometimes.
I see.  Let's make this quick, then. I'm busy.
How do you mean, Dr. Chilton?
Might I suggest tucking your pants into your socks? To prevent mouse intrusion.
Yes. I bought the house from her, two years ago.
Not yet.
It's all there, sir, practically verbatim.
Sir, that's a field job. It's outside the scope of my assignment. And I've got a test tomorrow on -
Murdered...? How?
You knew. You knew from the start that Lecter held the key to this... But you weren't up front with me. You sent me in to him naked.
Then have the lab check Raspail's head.  Dr. Lecter's patient - have them probe his soft-palette tissues... They'll find another cocoon.
Raspail was killed by the same man who's killing these girls. And Lecter knows him. Maybe even treated him... You think so, too, don't you? Or you'd never have sent me to that asylum.
Let's get some coffee and talk.
Good idea. Meantime, try to get a feel for Catherine Martin. Her apartment, her friends... how he might've stalked her. I'm going to the other two clinics, Minnesota and Ohio.  Now's the hardest part, Starling. Use your anger, don't let it keep you from thinking. Just keep your eyes on Catherine. We've got less than 30 hours.
They'll use their best men. But they better be paying attention...
But not from this angle. Not thinking he knew her. You've got to send me!
Starling -
Starling, we know who he is! And where he is. We're on our way now.
Johns Hopkins finally came up with a name for us. We fed him into Known Offenders, and he came up cherries.  Subject's name is "Jamie Gumb," AKA "John Grant." Lecter's description was accurate, he just lied about the name.
Sewing...
Stacy, did Fredrica ever mention a man named Jamie Gumb? Or John Grant?  Do you think she could've had a friend you didn't know about?
Did you ever work with her?
"We" being the Behavioral Science Unit, at Quantico. You're one of Jack Crawford's, I expect.
Did you do those drawings, Doctor?
Jack Crawford must be very busy indeed if he's recruiting help from the student body. Busy hunting that new one, Buffalo Bill... Such a naughty boy! Did Crawford send you to ask for my advice on him?
All flayed...?
You're a tough one, aren't you?
Why? Do you know something about him?
I never thought about it.
Who killed your patient?
Big through the hips. Roomy.
That's just part of the island. It has a very nice beach. Terns nest there.
The significance of the moth is change. Caterpillar into cocoon into beauty... Billy wants to change, too, Clarice. But there's the problem of his size, you see. Even if he were a woman, he'd have to be a big one...
How very thoughtful... Or did Crawford send you here for one last wheedle - before you're both booted off the case?
Clarice... you're hardly in a position to accuse me of lying.
I've studied the case file, have you...? Everything you need to find him is right in these pages. Whatever his name is.
First principles, Clarice. Simplicity. Read Marcus Aurelius. Of each particular thing, ask: What is it, in itself, what is its nature...? What does he do, this man you seek?
I don't know. I had no food or water. It was very cold. I thought - if I can even save just one... but he got so heavy. So heavy...
Yes...
Dr. Lecter -
You want to see a violation? This is a violation...
We leave in the morning?!
Anyone lookin' to pick up our trail, would see it as a sign of our passing...
Yes. He said... "do not try to make them understand you."
Yes. And "do not try to understand them.  That is because they are a breed apart and they make no sense..."
Because what I am interested in is right here...
I don't know. Whatever happens you stay with your father. You stay among the officers.
Winter with the Delaware, my father's cousins. And in the spring, cross the Ohio and look for land to settle with my father in a new place called Can-tuck-ee.
There was none!
Yes I do! I know exactly what I am saying.  And if it is sedition, then I am guilty of sedition, too!
Aversion?  No... "Hatred"... "Loathing"...
Yes. Yes, I will.
He delivered no such message.
Duncan...  Duncan, I promised you an answer. You have complimented me with your persistence and patience... But the decision I've come to is I'd rather make the gravest of mistakes than surrender my own judgment.
Munro is expecting him to be the good soldier in defense of British military interests.
What the bloody hell plan is this?
Dark haired...
Came across the war party, tracked 'em.
Your enemy...
First place, you started it with the French over fur-trapping claims to the head waters of the Ohio.  Now you're sayin' these people have a fight on their hands...
You, sir! You call yourself a loyal subject?
You're not coming with us?
Our father, Montcalm, is greater than the Yengeese in the arts of war. The Huron do not fear English anger.
No.  Huron serve no one. The French father believes he fooled Magua because he is so proud of his cleverness, he is blind. But it is the Huron path that Magua walks down, not the French one... Now, Les Francais, also, fear Huron. That is good. When the Huron is strong from their fear, we will make the terms of trade with Les Francais. And we will trade as the white man trades. Take land from the Abnakes; fur from the Osage, Sauk & Fox. And make the Huron great. Over other tribes. No less than the whites, as strong as the whites.
What did you see, Major?
And what is that?
Sir. Webb has no idea. And he certainly does not know to send reinforcements!
Yes sir!
Magua say: "Yes. Good idea."
Wampum?
Heart. Give Magua new heart.
Yes.
My master owns these lands and your father has been ordered to drive off the English squatters. They have consented to go. So now he calls them enemies no longer.
But so many suns have set since Le Renard struck the war post. Is he not tired?
And this?
Monsieur le Marquis, I am a soldier, not a diplomat. You called this parlay for a reason.
They may leave the fortress fully armed, but with no ammunition... Other than that, ask what you wish.
Carry them to England to your King with pride.
He did.
Danakil man?...one of our ancestors.  Named for the Danakil Alps in Ethiopia.
It was when it counted a couple of million years ago when the seas came in and drove us into the water.  Most homo sapiens didn't make it...Danakil man... <u>adapted</u>.
He did.
Can you fix it?
Think!  Can we stop it?! Block it up?!  Shut down the line somewhere?!  Think!
Fuck your orders!
What?
There probably wasn't anything wrong with his suit...
Maybe you're more one of us than you think...sir.
How much time does that give us?
Can't we fix it?
I can't see them!
Uh..Excuse me sir, it's the air recirculating system, sir...
Charge set.  Backing off.  C'mon Rover let's get out of here.
Okay.
Don't thank me, yet, but it is important to know where you're going and who your friends are... 'Know what I mean?
I realize you must have gone through hell--
You're damn right I do.  Five years down here and I'll pull in more than 15 topside.  I'm not down here for the fun, I'll tell you that.
Aw, loosen up, Bowman...  Hey, Willie, I got one served up for you.
Pretty good.  He sent them out videotaping outcrop.
He didn't say it was a "routine check-up," he said it was a "routine <u>precaution</u>."
Fuck double pay, man!  I want out of here!
I ain't doing nothing for that thing without something to defend myself.
And hit the surface in the middle of a typhoon?...No, thank you. I'll take my chance down here.
I'm going to kill it!
What?  That?...I've done this one before.  You hungry?  I'm hungry.
The infirmary?...
Like a leech.
Let's hope it holds.
Sixpack...
She's wondering what's happening.  We're losing air faster than I thought.
Sorry, darling...Just thought a little humor would loosen us all up...you know?...
Stop fucking around, Tom, and think. What are we going to do?
I am not sure what's more worrying, the job or your past.
Sex and sleaze and antique shotguns are all deep and dear in Harry's stone cold heart.
Jesus, Tom, do they work?
Well what?
They were . . .
We made a deal for everything inside the cabinet.
Better than good, he is a fucking liability.
Oh, you must be the brains then. That's right, guns that fire shot . . . Make sure you bring everything from inside the gun cabinet. There will be a load of guns, that's all I want. I'll pay you when you deliver. Everything outside the cabinet you can keep; it's yours.
Fucking Northern monkeys.
Er, yeah, sure, I'll have 'em.
It looks like it, but who knows? The opportunity was there. In my experience it is best to take the opportunity if it is there.
No chance of you lifting this sunbed up is there?
Well, you had better go and get it from the office. That's if you want to see your son reach his next birthday. Now chop-fuckin'-chop.
All right, Kenny.
What is the point in that? Even if it was a bug they would have taken it with 'em.
Who are you going to kill Plank? There's no one there.
How about you? All right?
Out the back.
Well we have got about a hundred thousand pretty pieces of paper with the Queen on it. Will that do?
Hit the fuckers.
Why, what's up?
Yup, you must be Harry? Sorry, I didn't know your father.
I wanted to talk to you about that.
Do you want me to draw a picture?
Well, perhaps you can help?
I know.  Now shut it. You say a fucking word the right knee goes, another word then your left.
What do you think I am doing? Hold on. What are you doing? Unlock that gate. Oi! I said unlock that fucking gate.
You know it doesn't include the amp.
Never mind that now. I also need some artillery, you know, a couple of sawn-off shotguns.
I think you're Nick the Greek.
All right, let's forget about them for the time being. What about your weed man?
When the bottle in my arse has contracted I'll let you know.
Six.
Twelve.
The problem is, Willy, that Charlie and yourself are not the quickest of cats in the alley at the best of times, so just do as I say and keep the fucking cage locked.
I'm not talking to you. You don't have any friends.
I can't take any more school.
Yes, sir--
It's their country. This is one of the best deals they offer.
No, sir. Not at all.
From back in Houston. We both come up on Fifth Street.
We were just dancing--
I'm feeling okay--
Yes, Sergeant.
Hey, Ben. Thanks for coming down.
That badge--
Who said anything about shootin' anybody?
You're fired. You're outta the department.
You little pissant--
That's in Maverick County.
Rio. BUNNY Right. This kid, Hosea Brown? Does tire 40 in 3.4, soft hands, lateral movement--the whole package. Only a sophomore--
You look awful good in that uniform, though.
He never asked her.
The Trail of Tears.
They fought against the Indians?
You know who I am?
By blood you are. But blood only means what you let it.
Dad--
You live in a place, you should know something about it. Explore--
We had a kid pass out in the men's room. The town isn't much.
You get the feeling he doesn't want to be here?
Priscilla says they think any woman over 30 who isn't married must be a lesbian. She figures they'll be so relieved I'm a man--
They were using M-1's, yeah--
Well--I don't see what's changed. No - PDA's, no necking on the obstacle course.
You know who it was they dug up?
I meant on the post. In general. How are you dealing with it?
Hobby of mine. Got some artifacts, couple pieces one of your men out at the base made. Free admission.
It's a bar. People come together, drink, fall in love, fall out of love, air their grudges out--
Nice to meet you, Ma'am.
Why would you want to do that?
No hay de que. Tengo otra. [No problem, I've got another.]
This same person been bragging all over the county how he don't have to cut that big gringo Sheriff in on it-- he can run his own operation 'thout any help. Como se llama, amigo?
Bandidos, Injuns--
We have a daughter.
He was a unique individual.
That's not the whole story. The Mexicans that know, that remember, understand what Buddy was for their people.  Hell, it was Mercedes over there who swung the deciding vote for him.
We made our collection at Roderick's place and that was the last anybody seen hide nor hair of him.  He went missing the next day, along with ten thousand dollars in county funds from the safe at the jail.
--but Buddy Deeds was my salvation.
When you backed me you needed somebody named Deeds to bump the other fella out of office.  Hey, folks--
Oh, you know, the usual troublemakers. Danny Padilla from the Sentinel, that crowd.
Sounds great. Where do I sign up?
Just as well. The new people just painted it some God-awful color--
You recall if Charley Wade was a Mason?
No. I think his widow's still in their place in Darktown, though.  You think it's Charley Wade, huh?
We got that dedication tomorrow. This is a hell of a time to be draggin' up old business.
I wish I could tell you I remembered something new, but I can't.
People come here to catch bass and to get laid at the Boy's Town in Cuidad Leon--
Danny's gonna be out for blood the next time.
Look, I'm not gonna campaign against your deal here, but if anybody asks me, I got to tell them the truth. We-- don't--need--a new jail.
Steve?
Spanish, please. My mother would have a heart attack.
I'm unmarried. I'm not available.
No. I was wondering if you'd like to take a trip down south with us. Maybe see where you grew up--
Maybe now. It was different back then. I had this place, I was doing all the shopping, all the cooking. What do I need some chulo with grease under his nails to drink up the profit?
Sheriff Buddy was a different story. Long as Roderick throw his weight the right way on election day, make sure all the colored get out to vote- we was called colored back then, if you was polite--maybe throw a barbecue for the right people now and then, things was peaceful. That Sheriff Wade, though, he took an awful big bite.
Enough with the clothes--
Hey, Pete. How's it going?
You stop growing that loco weed at your place, you'd see a lot more daylight.
I thought he busted you a couple times.
I'm surprised he bothered with it.
They've got my Amado.
Somebody called--something about an electronics store.
We haven't talked since high school.
I can't name anybody she does like these days.
He hates me.
Couple months before I was born--
Buddy bought the cafe for her with money he took from the county. Pilar looks away, struggling not to cry--
Okay--we'll take a statement from all the GIs before they go back to post. You can get the story from Otis over at the club.
Don't know if I'll still want it.
You don't need to cuff me.
Just doing my job.
Yeah. It's quiet--
Uh-huh.
You believe that?
Yeah.  It's French.
Have a nice evening, Mr. D'Amour.
My life was too weird for her.
That would have kept you out of the Magic Circle.  Which was presumably the idea.  These are about Nix.
Knew what?
I'm out of here, man!  Are you coming?
That's so cool.
He's a priest?
So tell me where Nix is buried.
Yes...
But obviously you still care what happens to him.
He's an illusionist.  It's not exactly brain surgery.
Harry.
Yes.  I think you probably can.  We'd need to talk about your fee.
Yes... I'm here.  And no.  I don't know the name.
I didn't leave.  I was just digging around.
Jennifer Desiderio, for one.  She threw herself in front of a car this afternoon.
It was more than that, I think.
It's all right.  It's not hurting...
I... have... to.
I think so.
Harry-?
Good.  There.  Yes?
Yeah.  Remember Quaid?
I'm a private detective.  I was hired to follow somebody for a few days.  A guy called Tapert. Insurance fraud.
--vanished.
Just tell me about Swann.  Or are you too scared?
Evil.  He was evil.  Come on.
Fuck you.
We've never met.
You could almost pass for a detective, D'Amour.  I work for the best illusionist in the world.
Probably.
Are you a believer, then?
Swann's wife.
What's her problem?
I'm not afraid to die.  There's something terrible... coming home...
Sure.  Vivovich.
It's not a business. Harry. It's a vocation.
They'll never find out.
Why?  So you can fuck my wife?
He deserved it.
I did it for Dorothea.
I don't know what else to do.
Will that do?  No?
Is that all?
No.
Yes.
Looks that way.
In my time, and nobody else's.
I got to go.  I'm late.
A couple of weeks.
Bob, it's me.
You'll do it?
Oh.
I'm not sure, yet... I graduated last spring.
Philosophy.
I'm here for the week.
Thanks for getting me back in one piece.
Yeah, you don't remember?
I know, I kind of blend in here.
I don't know. My fax said "have a good fright".
Thanks. It does, the more you know who you are... you don't care about things the same way...
Where'd you grow up?
I know, but that's what you like about me.
How old is she?
Oh, she'll love it.
No, we'll find something around here.
You're a brat, wasn't there anyone else around to lavish you with attention?
I don't know, it just doesn't, reality changes things....we can't stay here forever, unless maybe we started a Jazz band.
Yes, no.
Thanks.
What?
Fine.
I have to go, Adam's tormenting Zoe, I'll talk to you later. Are you going to be Ok?
It's Lydia, your wife.
Fine. Is it going ok?
Tomorrow.
Mr. Harris, we have fax for you!
Ok. Maybe I'll walk down with you.
What?
I gotta go to work.
But I like to... and I don't smoke that much.
Are you sure you have to go?
Ok, definitely call them, I'll be back Friday. I love you.
Charlotte?! How's Tokyo?
I'm just here shooting this band, what about you?
Sorry if I have the worst B.O., I've been sweating in this little room with T.V. lights for hours...
Do you think they have a room here?
It's probably trivial.
I must really be slacking off.  Hungry?
Forgot my car keys.  What are you doing on the fourth floor?
Well, it's a nice surprise.  Should I hit the "stop" button?
When did they find her?
No, of course not, but I think now that this has happened, a lot of things can start to come out...
Like you need to admit that losing your parents when you were twelve was traumatic.
You need to believe in something besides yourself.
What time did you make it for?
And how would you describe him?
I think I should join you.
You heard voices, you know you did.
I don't have the experience.  Father Thomas should officiate.
You ready?
You know how I feel.  The world is random.  The only certainty I believe in is death.
Don't you get it?  They had their 2,000 years.  Now it's our turn.
You are my son.  Don't you see the opportunity that lies before you?
I had to.  There was no other way. Their deaths were part of the greatest legacy I could have given you.
I know, Maya, but you'll understand when you see this man.  I really need your strength.
Don't worry...about the transformation, Maya.
Would you like to rest, Miette?  You must be exhausted.
...art sank, sun set, ark sank again...
What's his name?
Oh, thank you, thank you so much!
Please, the children.
Townsend believed, just as God became man in Christ.  So Satan will assume human form.  I believe it too.
If you're possessed, you can't reveal anything Satan wants hidden.  Unless you trick him.
You're already contaminated.  It's why you couldn't hear the tape.  There's probably a pentacle near your bed.  To sanctify you.
So...then the coroner's report is probably wrong.  I mean...this is ridiculous.  There's been a mistake.  I don't believe any of this.
Townsend, he had some of Father's books.
What?
What's the bible for?
Until it happens, you're still a human being.
Maybe I should check Lareaux's book. It's in the car.  Be right back.  Don't go anywhere.
You have to be experienced to do this. Just wait outside. Otherwise, you risk killing him.
And his message was  "Together, no matter what?"
And what's that mean?
We need all the help we can get.
You are the younger of two...
I'll be at Bedford tonight, if you need me.
We millionaires yet?
Well, long-term exposure to things like this tends to give you a sort of clinical understanding of the subject. After awhile, you begin to make friends with it, so to speak.
Yeah, look at that sweet face.  You'd never guess he killed nine people.  I'm gonna get my smokes.  Be right back.
I'll quit, maybe you should start.
How're you doin' today?
How is he?
His mother had a cookout a few weeks ago. He could do a lot better if you ask me.
Don't tell me you aren't ashamed of that because I know.
The blue.
Are you okay?
Until the Black family down the street became the Black family next door.
You're a caterer?
Thanks.
It's just...it seems like you're always yelling at me.
I mean, I'm having a good time with you...
Then I'll get you some punch.
Shh.  It's okay.
Don't go starting rumors, Jim.  My son's college bound with or without basketball.
Kyra, this is Monica.  She, uh...
Get used to it, babe.
Why not?
You're just scared.  I know rehab is hard, and you have to worry about whether you'll be as good as you were but you will be.  I believe in you.  You just have to get back on the court.  Like you'd get back on a horse.
Always on my ass, anyway.
Damn, Lena...  Who is he?
Hey.  You just worry about playing your behind off for that recruiter tonight. Let me worry about your date.
Chances are there's still a chance.
She hates all freshmen.
Just wanted to say good game.
Just one word of advice for next season.
Never let a freshman take your spot.
Just like that?
Just not my type, I guess.
Sometimes.  But what's the alternative, not playing?  You remember big Toni?  She quit last year, now she's working at some bookstore.  I mean, look at us. They treat us like we're Hollywood stars over here.  We just played in the championship game.  It doesn't get much sweeter than this.
Lucky.
Uh huh.
I just can.
My Mom says she doesn't know where I come from 'cause I act different.
I guess, you know, we play ball and we ride to school together.  And if you get mad at me, I gotta give you flowers.
Man, forget you then, stupid.
Some note Shawnee Easton told me to give to you.
She's a ho cause she's sending her coochie through the mail.
And?  She's not saying, "I think you're a nice guy and I wanna get to know you better," she's saying, "I wanna bone."
Yeah, an honest tramp-ass ho.  But I guess you'll stick your dick in anything.
Would you watch the damn road?
With a jacked-up attitude.
You either.
Hey.
Yeah.
He ain't Spalding.
Cause I don't just stick my dick in anything.
I know, right?
I said fine.
Quit.
Plan to.
I know he messed up, but that doesn't change what he's been to you.
Why not?
What's up?
The "man" again.
If I stayed, I wouldn't be starting!
I decided to go pro.  And who knows where I'll end up, you know?
Uh huh.
A rest?
Getting there.
Because I'm kinda feeling that way, too.
Seems like I needed a ball when I was trying to be like my pops...or trying to be better than him.  Now, I kinda think I need to try something else.
It's a trip, you know?  When you're a kid, you see the life you want, and it never crosses your mind that it's not gonna turn out that way.
Why do you keep asking me that?
Something was just missing.
Nona, don't start bitching.  I got maybe two years left to play.  I'm just trying to put some things together for us.
Uh, your earring?
Said he'd be home later.
Cause when you say can't, you ain't a man.
Okay...
What mess?
Tell me what?
No, you need to hear me say it, I'll say it.  It's not true.
A case like this could hang around for months and I'm up for this player relations job with the "Clips."  This gets out, false or not, no one'll touch me.
I can't believe you're gonna do this to me, the situation I'm in, I don't -- Avi: You know what?  Being hit by lighting doesn't matter for getting braces, ok? Now Solomon, let me just ask you once: Please. Please. Don't do this.
I'm fuckin' hammered, Burt.
I'm really only equipped to take orders --
Does this sound weird?
It's rough.  I'm sorry, did she make it?
It's a helluva disease.
Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Please.  It doesn't have to be now. Maybe we can make a date to sit down, I didn't mean to walk in on you like this --
I don't want you to think that I'm that way to you -- I'm not gonna call you a slut or something --
Now STOP IT and LISTEN to me right now. I AM DYING, I GOT SICK...now I fell down and I'm Not...DON'T --
I'm not lying to you, I'm not --
baby, please, please --
YOU BURN IN BELL.  You burn in hell and you deserve it -- YOU GET THE FUCK OUT.
GET OUT.
GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.
I'm coming!
I'm sorry, I had to get dressed.
No one else in there with you?
Did you hear what I said?
I got a call of a disturbance, screaming and yelling, loud music.  Has there been some screaming and yelling?
Yeah...it's not...it's been on for a bit --
It's not -- what's a 422?
yeah, good, ok.
You wanna go on a date with me?
What about ten o'clock, is that too late?  I don't get off and then --
No, no, just casual maybe, maybe I thought -- there's a spot I like to go, it's real nice that overlooks a golf course and the course is lit up at night --
Yeah, You know it? You know Billingsley's?
Oh, see?  This is great.  Ten o'clock.
Well, that's a natural thing, two people go out on a date, something.  They want to impress people, the other person...or they're scared maybe what they say will make the other person not like them --
Let's make a deal.
I'm sorry --
I didn't mean...it's seems vulgar or something, I know --
ok.
That felt good to do...to do what I wanted to do.
You don't how fuckin' stupid I am.
Ohhhh I started this, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I, fuck.
Yes.
yeah, yes, hi, hello.
Diet Coke.
I want a shot of tequila too.
Ready to go,go,go?
They're here, they're fine. In the dressing room.  See you later --
It's upstairs.
Sure, why?
I can check on that for you, maybe we can take a tour --
Put the gun down, please, boy.
You don't just sign up to be a police officer -- it's about three years of training -- ok?
Why the hell aren't you in school?
They don't have substitute teachers where you go to school?
I'm a rapper.
Not yet -- "give you the clue for the bust if you show me some trust --"
C'mon, man, just watch me, watch and listen --
Now that shit will help you SOLVE the case.
What's up?
He's doing the interview with the lady --
A very chatty-kind, you do, indeed, it seems.
What?
I used to be smart but now I'm just stupid.
"The" cause of dullness in others --
"It's a dangerous thing to confuse chidlren with angels..."
Don't get strong, Donnie. This is making sense, this making a lot of sense. You are not doing the job, the job I ask you to do, a job I give you. Over and over and over and I'm sorry. But I'm not gonna say I'm sorry that much more.
It's...doesn't matter....
Well that's what Hospice will take care of for you.  They will send a nurse, someone who can take care of all of that for you --
You do?
-- memory?
How come every word you say is either "cocksucker," or "shitballs," or "fuck?"
I'll get you another pain pill. Another morphine pill --
Who?
What?  Say it again...walking in the car?
Mm. Hm.
I don't how much I went -- but I was enrolled.  I was such a loser back then. I was -- misguided, pathetic -- I was very fat. Not even close to what I am today. Not the Frank TJ Mackey you're eager to talk to because I was swimming in what <u>was</u> as opposed to I <u>wanted</u>.
What name?  My name?
...are you Phil...?
Let's just wait one minute and stay here, okay?
For six months.  I'm the day nurse...
Um...soon tonight...I think, yes? Tommorrow...I mean...very soon...very...
Oh yeah.
Calm down.
Don't test me, you wanna talk about what the law book says, we can do that, push me far enough and I'll take you to jail -- now calm down.
You're not calm.  You're screamin' and yellin' and I'm here to check on a disturbance that was reported and that's what I'm gonna do - now are you alone in here?
OK.  That's true.  Is anyone else, besides me and besides you in this house?
I'm not askin', Marcie.
And what about screaming?
I went out last night.
I don't have to do a god damn thing.
THERE'S NO ONE IN THERE!
Then what?
-- that you shouldn't have done? That you regret, what? This? What's this? Fuck, man, c'mon.  Treat me like an asshole, but treat me like an <u>asshole</u>.
All your other fluzzies?
I got in trouble at school.
Find her, get her and tell her I want to talk to her, Mary.  Fucking hell.
Are you alright?
I'm a bad person.
No, I mean:  I'm telling you this, now. You see?  You see I want to make everything clear and clean...and apologize for me....for all the stupid things I've done....that will eat me up....
How long with Ellen?
What about now?
I'm not through asking my questions.
Why, well I think we've, we both don't know...what do you mean?
I really don't know.
Yes.  What's your name?
No.  But I probably will get a call back.
When they want us done, they'll call in the Harvard S.W.A.T team or some shit.
Like what?
I don't wanna do it.  Why can't one of you do it --
No...I just... I'm so fucked up here Alan, I don't know...there's so much...so many things --
What kind of medication are you on right now, Linda that's --
Well.  Considering that there's no one else mentioned in the will...we'd have to go to the laws of intestacy, which is -- as if someone died without a will --
The money would go to Frank.  The court would put the money in the hands of a relative --
Earl asked me, Linda, please, Linda, I'm sorry -- Earl asked me --
mmmhmm.
Hi. I'd like to get an order for delivery.
Water.
Thank you.
I'm sick of being the one, the one who always has to do everything, I don't want to be the one always --
Love you too.
You're late, not me.
I'm fine. nothing.
Stand up.
Hi.
It's raining frogs from the sky.
M'lady...?
No, stay back!  Stay back!
D'Artagnan.
He was my blood -- and I demand to know what happened to him.
No, Louis!  No!
Perhaps you can find out who this secret leader of the Jesuits is. You are now a priest, but you were once a Musketeer, serving the throne of France, a throne ordained of God. Can you accept this mission, and keep it private?
How goes that favor I asked of you?
Well here is the problem at hand: the King has ordered me to discover the identity of the Governor General of Jesuits, and kill him.  As our English rivals have left the Catholic Church, Louis has struck on a plan to dominate the whole of Europe by uniting Church and State and making himself head of both.  He has already picked the Pope.  Only the Jesuits, who put God above throne or papacy, stand in his way.
Replace the king.
You seek facts, when it would be better to seek truth.
Those can be adopted --
In a year, maybe two, I could teach him enough to --
He can learn to be Phillippe in time.  But first he must learn to be Louis, and for that he has two more days.
We have grown wiser with age.  Now we know that some problems cannot be settled with a sword.
I know.  God go with you.
There are more important things than tits.
It is also a place of burial.
So they tell us.  But what are we to believe when the king is a tyrant, and the Church, meant to stand for all those oppressed, has become the tool of oppression?  When no conscience is tolerated?  No dissent, no objection?
I expected action.  There was no killing, no fighting, I was useless.
I will answer all your questions. But first soap, water, and a razor.
Well... Well... Okay.
Who?
Perhaps this will help.
If the young woman truly loves Raoul --
I fear I know our King.  I came to try to bring you hope.
You trust his character more than anyone else does.
Get out of my way.
No man is all bad... or all good.  I believe -- I must believe -- that Louis can learn.  And perhaps I can help him.
What is its antidote?
Whose rooms are those?
She will be at the ball.
How did you --
It is for your security that I have come, your Majesty -- for the security of your honor.
Mademoiselle Michelle Beaufort.  She is betrothed to Raoul, the son of Athos the Musketeer, who has served France through many tribulations.
It is not Raoul's heart alone that concerns me.  It is yours.  I know you find women compliant -- especially the poorer ones like Michelle.  But do they love you?  Do you love them?  What about a queen to love?  A son of your own?
You will protect me as you always have, d'Artagnan.
... tired.  Must... lie down.
My twin.  Which has kept him alive. Until now.
No.  Even if I could give up my friends, I could never give up my son.
No, Keeper.
Out directing the search for the traitors.
Sire, I --
If what you're saying is true, then why would he have killed two police officers? A man like that would want to lay low, if he was planning some kind of damn sabotage mission!
So what?
You mean shut your ass down!
We're all gonna fan out!  C'mon, let's do a sweep of the alleys -
Don't worry -
I didn't hit shit!
Right behind you.
These crowds are going to make it a bitch!
That's got to our secret agent man! Do we have an address?
I didn't break in - the back door was open!
Seattle.
You're the mysterious type, right?
No...
Figure you would have tried it already.
Six months ago, a police lieutenant named Charles Fletcher was found dead in a hotel room - he blew his brains out - left no note, you may have heard of it...
I got out of there.	I just grabbed up my stuff, and then I found it.
What happened with the tape?
Tubbs listen!  I don't know anywhere else to go!  I need your help!
This is Tubbs. Sorry I can't answer the phone, I'm out square dancing. Leave a message--
I killed them.
OK...where do you want to start?
What else is new?
I'm not going anywhere!
Well I've kind of had my fill of the place, you know what I mean?
Hop in.
Well, you saved me from a bad situation. Thanks.  I admit this is...unusual.
Screw him!
Did you have sex with her?
County jail - get in.
Where is he?
Yeah, and that's all I'm going to say. If you want to arrest me, go ahead...
I need to ask you questions of a psychological nature.
Twenty minutes max.
Have him meet me with pictures of Lecktor's books...
Library of Congress.
Will Graham, Jack Crawford...
That's it. Lecktor called him a Pilgrim when he was talking to me...
Because it's his bad luck to be special.
Nobody's better with evidence. But he has the other thing, too. He doesn't like that part of it...
I don't want to talk about it anywhere.  If you brought pictures, leave them in the briefcase. Molly and Kevin will be back soon.
Somebody hurt him?
As long as they're dead...
I'LL come back later. I got messages at the Holiday Inn to collect.
What do you want to do?
Say we've arrested a good suspect. You walk in and see him. What is there about him that doesn't surprise you?
What's one way?
To recover the mind set.
After we've worked the note we want to replace it in Lecktor's cell. I don't want him to know we found it.  Where's Lector now?
We let Lecktor's message run as is and decode it after. Or we pull it, work our the code and put ours in next week.
I'll tell you in a second. Now listen to me: everything is okay, I'm taking care of it, so stay on the phone when I tell you.
'Changes?'
VTR, film, Polaroid, stills, what?
Don't talk to me!!
What?
Stay in the trees.
He asked for Will. He said he might call back tonight. I tried to hold him... I'm sorry... He said 'tell Graham "broken mirrors."'
Put your back against the door. Come forward three steps until you feel the tile on your feet and there will be a stool just to your left.
No, thanks. I manage very well.  I'll order you twelve hundred feet: of 1000 C tomorrow.
They had to shape up their employment practices to keep this defense contract.
You'll come by?
Me.
Some remarkable events have happened in Birmingham and Atlanta.  Do you know what I'm talking about?
The Tooth...
Was I in an accident?
I don't want to know.
I'm very scared.
I don't know...
Oh, God.
Yes.
'I have had a great privilege. I have seen with wonder the strength of the Red Dragon. All I wrote about him before was lies from Will Graham. He made me write them. Now I understand.  'Will Graham: you will learn from my own lips how much you have to dread. Because I was forced to lie, he will be more merciful to me than to you.  'I will be a testament to the truth, now.  About his work. About his becoming.'
Absolutely,
Dr. Chilton.
I might have to show him some material that could stimulate him.
Uh... sure...
Maybe you can help me. This is Bob Greer of Blaine & Edwards Publishing Company. Dr. Bloom asked me to send a copy of 'The Psychiatrist and the Law' to someone. Linda never sent me the address and phone number.
I have to catch Federal Express within about five minutes. I'd be immensely appreciative if you'd pull it out of her Rolodex for me.
Well, zip that little pointer right on down to the letter G.
No. I can help you.
Cut the general crap.
What's average?
One's on the respirator at a hospital in Baltimore. The other is in a private mental hospital in Denver.
I call him a monster.
Did the Jacobis in Birmingham have a dog?
We have it good, don't we?
Stay here with me. Me. Me. Me.  And Kevin.  That's selfish, huh?
Hey, baby! Where are you?
Let's keep it the day-to-day stuff.  How's Kevin?
Blue, then.
Hey, goddamn it, paint it shit-brown for all I care...  Look, I'm sorry. When I come home, we'll go to the paint store together and get some chips and...
No.
Where we're at is nowhere. We have nothing. We're running out of time.
I have to go back to Birmingham.
No. I have to be in there...  alone. Maybe there's something for me if I know how he feels and thinks.
Will, they never get to see Kevin and a few more days...
Will?  You could come up here.
Are you George Sherman?
No. You're very well-protected.  No one can find our where you are.
Yes.
Hobbs was insane. He was attacking college girls and he killed them.
Yes. Hobbs had one of his daughters from behind. He was cutting her. I shot him.
No.
...after a while.
...yes.
Very interesting, even to a layman.
You read about it, I'm sure.
You'll get to see the file on this case. And there's another reason.
No.
Yes. I'd considered it.
When you do have one I'd like to hear it.
Do you know how you caught me, Will?
I'm worn out with you crazy sons-of- bitches. If you've got something to say, Lecktor, say it.
You got it.
I'm not a comedian.  I have no talent.  I'm a song-and-dance man.
"No"?  "No" to which part??
He's a Vegas entertainer.  I used to do impressions of him.  We sorta... got in a fight over that.
The ONLY reason I did Taxi was so I could have my own Special!
Yeah, we can have a garage sale. "Hey look, I got a floor lamp and a network TV Special for only fifty cents!"
You're DAMN RIGHT you're sorry!  And you -- you're the road manager! You should be watchin' out for him!
WRONG!  You haven't given them any clues that it's a parody!
Andy!  You don't get it!  They don't want you back.
Ehhh, you know those guys.  If he had his way, I'd be stuck in the hospital, running tests all day.  And anyway, I've found a new guy who's gonna be able to instantly remove the cancer.
Eh, I dunno... Andy.  I'm... thinkin' of letting you go...
Sure!  Comedy!  Make jokes about the traffic.  Do impressions.  Maybe a little blue material...
You know that's not what I meant! Look, I'm gonna put my foot down! No more playing alone.  You wanna perform, you GOTTA have an audience!
But that's it.  I needed you to believe!  Our family will be in the newspapers.  People will look, and they'll be touched.  Because your emotions were honest!
Twenty!
No no no, it's not sex!  I mean -- it can lead to sex... but really, it's just wrestling.
Oh.  So you were just pretending to be an asshole.
Hi... am I late?
No thanks.
No thanks.
Hey, I love movie theater popcorn... but that doesn't mean I have to sit through "On Golden Pond."
No!  YOU get in the kitchen.  I'm gonna make you dry my dishes!
I-I'm sorry.  I got caught up in the action...!
It's me.
I don't deserve Haagen Daz.  I'm a horrible person.
Okay.  You're probably right.
Andy, it'll be fine!  It's what we're known for!  "Maui?  "Wowie!"
Nah.  The girls sponge off between johns.
Who gives a shit?!  It's not funny!
The wrestling... the sexist remarks... the foul language... these things are not becoming of an enlightened individual.  It seems you have no respect for anything.
Doctor, I think I need a neck brace.
I'll take my chances!!
Er, yes.  Speaking.
Sure!  But WE think it's kickass! Now I get to be Tony.  I get to dump the glass of water on someone else's head!
Where?
Who knows?!  That kid is totally meshuga.
Expect it.  Did you get anything from the room?
You all look the same to me.
I know.  It's her fault.
I know but I felt like taking a shift.
Hear what?
Don't tell me you're a believer now?
My God.  Morpheus.  You gave them Morpheus.
The Matrix isn't real!
What are you doing?
Any time.
Shit!  Apoc?
I've been looking for you, Neo.  I don't know if you're ready to see what I want to show you, but unfortunately, we have run out of time.  They're coming for you, Neo. And I'm not sure what they're going to do.
Yes.
But what if...?
There's a small ledge.  It's a short climb.  You can make it.
It's an honor.
More important than what is when?
I didn't say that it would be easy, Neo.  I just said that it would be the truth.
You -- you're too fast.
Your mind makes it real.
What -- what lesson?
Yes.  She's very old.  She's been with us since the beginning.
She would say she knows enough.
Don't think of it in terms of right and wrong.  She is a guide, Neo. She can help you find the path.
What do you believe in?
Got one ready, sir.  Subway.  State and Balbo.
What?
Gee-zus.
It's necessary, Neo.  For our protection.
That the Matrix cannot tell you who you are.
That's different.
... right as rain.
There has to be something that we can do.
I'm fine.  Come on, we have to keep moving.
No.
The last human city.  The only place we got left.
Hey, Mikey, he likes it!  Ready for more?
The Oracle.
Depends on the mind.  But eventually, it will crack and his alpha pattern will change from this to this.
Because I believe in something.
Mr. Wizard, get me the fuck out of here!
You're not far from Cypher.
You're going to kill him?  Kill Morpheus?!
Tank, I need a pilot program for a military M-109 helicopter.
Well the guy over there said...
And cherry bombs...ash cans...and rockets?
'Take a little tip from Mack the Knife...'
You are with out a doubt the biggest, most pretentious bullshit thrower I know.  Like to see what kind of business you'd do.
'And with your spirit.'
'Dost thou say this of thyself, or have others told thee of me?'
And say what?
Sure.  And you're gonna take the vows next Tuesday, right.
I swear to God Charlie, it's the truth.
C'mon Tony, waddaya say?
Should I slap him?
I don't like loading crates.
What about your attitude...Where's your job...eh?  You talk and talk and I go to work...what do you do?
You tell me that in front of these creeps?
No.
Good idea.
Not next week's either...listen...you tell that to Giovanni, not me.
I'd like to know Charlie, it looks like your little friend is trying to duck me...
Michael, nobody's out to screw you, I guarrantee that.
All right...but understand, I don't like being taken advantage of.  I mean you're in there talking with your uncle and all...This is embarassing.
Nothin'.  Just stiffed those kids. Don't want'em comin' back and findin' you...start asking you questions.
'Amen I say to thee, thou wilt not come out from it until thou hast paid the last penny.'
Stripper?
Chinese food?
Why not here...Ok nevermind...6th Avenue and Waverly.
No you weren't.
Ok.
Well, he was always a little crazy... he puts a gun in his mouth...  ...like your friend...comme si chiama...Henning?  Heming?
Wha?
Oh yeah...didn't read it but I saw the movie...Gregory Peck...pretty good.
Charlie, couple of courses isn't enough to get you student deferred... I mean if they wanted to draft you, you would've been drafted by now.
Oh, that's ok...I've been in and out of this place fifty times.
It's all right.
Ummmmmmmmmmmmm.
Charlie...I've got to see you.  I want to talk...
Count it.
Yeah, so things'll be even.
You could say that.
Of course!  A double for Michael, Tony.
You what?
Quiet please.
Drew called from the AStar, they're still two minutes away.
Haven't you had enough of us, Dad?
Hi, Allison --
No.
We've got some things to discuss.
Conflict, honey.  Korean Conflict.
Annie made them.
'Goddam party'!
It's starting to grow on me.  But what do the 'B' and 'P' mean?
He said he would be there with bells on.
Yeah, they hit the calf over the head with a mallet and then Luisa hits it again in the kitchen.
How would you like that, sir?  On some kind of toast?
Here...
Of whom?
Then why did you bring it up?
Susan's patient is whom we are talking about.
What'd it say?
'Yes' to the deal?
What?!
Yes.
'Just kidding'?
I thought this was practically a done deal --
For how long?  And why?
Please, Drew.
Yes, you made your feeling abun- dantly clear.  Now they want to do the same with theirs.
I don't care.
Yours.
I don't think so.  Do you?
No lawyers, Drew.  We're going to offer you a deal.
You get not to go to jail.
Proof?  We've got plenty of proof.
-- But he was concerned about the timing?
That we did.  Thanks to you.  He was wobbling, mind you, but you spplied the coup de grace.
Quince, you can't unscramble scrambled eggs.
Obeah evil.  I not evil.
Not dis pain.  Dis pain tru an' tru. Make it go 'way.
Make it time.
Yes.
Mine, too.
You loved back?
She knows you real self?
Hi, Jennifer.
As long as it takes.
And you're a nice man, Quince.
I'm lost.
I'm sorry.
I don't have any time to see you now.  I'm doing grand rounds and then I'm examining back-to-back patients until dinner and then --
I thought you said 'Be sorry for nothing'.
I don't know.
I am, too.
To bed.
And is your heart beating strangely?
How beautiful.
I loved it.
Oh, I hope a long, long time.
And you can't tell me who you are.
Lightning struck.  We caught it in a bottle.  Don't let it out.  I want to be with you, Joe --
And I said you'd have a hard time finding a woman like that.
Your doctor?  Did your doctor say anything about a tiny, undetectable hole in your aorta?  Did he mention an irreparab- ly weak vein in the further reaches of your famous brain?  Were there any prognostications about the possibil- ilites of a fatal collision on a golf cart or suffocating in an avalanche on a ski vacation in Gstaad?
That's what everybody says.
I understand.
Yes.
Cold lamb sandwich with cilantro.  A little Coleman's mustard.
Absolutely.
I don't want anybody buying up my life's work and turning it into something it wasn't meant to be.  A man wants to leave something behind. And he wants it left behind the way he made it.  And he wants it to be run the way he run it -- with a sense of honor, of dedication, of truth. Okay?
And I don't need your goddamn permis- sion either!  You!  Drew!  I don't need anyone to tell me how to run my life.
I guess...
I wouldn't put it that way.
Goodnight.
'Fish'?
Then I can't help you.
I was just asking, Bill.
Susan is my daughter, she has a wonderful life ahead of her and you're going to deprive her of it and you're telling me you're sorry?  Well, I'm sorry, apology not accepted.
Some aimless infatuation in which, for the moment, you feel like in- dulging.  It's missing everything that matters.
Get him in here.
It's time to put this person where he belongs.
Thank you.
I guess you have your reasons.
I'm here.
I want to have a look around before I take you.
Show me around.  Be my guide.  And in return, you get...
Watch it!
How's that, Quince?
Next week?
Well said, Eddie.  Mr. Black, shall we?
Yeah - Bill - How are you?  You okay?
...Then don't.
I know it's none of my business --
So what's wrong with that?
Bravo.
A-Okay.  Got my gloves on, my ears pricked.  I'm ready for action.
Incidentally, 'Joe' what?
Cut it out, Susan.  You and I've got to talk.  Big day tomorrow, everybody.  Joe, let's go.
Yeah, it's good to get together.
Well, remember how you told me about "lightning striking"?  The nature of it's in there somewhere.
Now we love Drew and Joe in verbo- ten?  What's going on?
Joe?
No -- I love you so much and I want you to promise me something.  I don't want you to ever worry about me.  If anything should happen, I'm going to be fine and everything's going to be all right.  -- And I have no regrets.
That's why it's okay.
And I want to get into my apartment and go to work.  Please, what do you say, another cup of coffee?
'Pro bono'.  That means doing good -- Going to be doing good all your life?
Did I say something wrong?
Because I like you so much.  You have coffee here every morning, don't you?  If I came by, could you give me the name of a doctor?
No. It's different. I have no short-term memory. I know who I am and all about myself, but since my injury I can't make any new memories. Everything fades. If we talk for too long, I'll forget how we started. I don't know if we've ever met before, and the next time I see you I won't remember this conversation. So if I seem strange or rude, that's probably...
Seen you together, that's all.
When was I in here?
Why didn't you clean it out?					 *
Leonard.
That's right I did, didn't I?
Yeah, I remember you.
Don't say anything else.
Sounds perfect? What do I owe you?
Who is he? What have you got me into?
That's the problem! How can I find John G. when I don't know what's going on?! How did you get me into this?!
There are things you know for sure.
What happened?
Where is he?
I'll go see him.
Yeah?
This guy's dangerous, let's think of something else.
I can talk about whoever the fuck I want! You won't even remember what I say! I can tell you that your wife was a fucking whore and we can still be friends!
That's easy for you to say! You can't get scared, you don't remember how, you fucking idiot!
Maybe it is! How the fuck would you know?! You don't know a fucking thing! You can't get scared, can you get angry?!
Sweet.
What are you here for?
It's good.
I enjoy it.
You're in a playful mood.
Yeah, yeah. I heard enough about him. Tell me about John G. You still think he's here, right?
I'll ride with him. You follow.
Lenny, as a buddy, let me inform you. Your business here is very much finished. You're still here because of Natalie.
Yeah, well maybe she'll make it you. Is that it? You worried she'll use me against you?
Why are you following me?
The sort of questions you should be asking yourself.
So in your grief you wandered into a Jaguar dealership?
Don't go back in there. There's a motel out of town. 
There's a guy in here, hurt bad! We gotta get him to a doctor!
You tell everyone about Sammy. Everyone who'll listen. "Remember Sammy Jankis, remember Sammy Jankis". Great story. Gets better every time you tell it. So you lie to yourself to be happy. Nothing wrong with that - we all do. Who cares if there's a few little things you'd rather not remember?
Sammy let his wife kill herself! Sammy ended up in an institution - !				    *
Sammy didn't have a wife.
Yes, I will.
Just some guy. Does it even matter who? I stopped asking myself why a long time ago. No reason, no conspiracy; just bad fucking luck. A couple of junkies, too			 * strung out to realize that your wife didn't live alone. When you killed him,			* I've never seen you so happy - I was convinced you'd remember. But it didn't stick, like nothing ever sticks. Like this won't stick.
No. You took them out.						  *
To set yourself a puzzle you won't ever solve. You know how many towns, how many		    * guys called James G? Or John G? Shit, Leonard, I'm a John G.
Doing...?
Three wakes off the back of those boats.  Who runs three Sterling engines off a deep-V hull?
...you'd be operating outside territorial United States.  Your badges do not count.  You have no authorization to carry weapons.  If you're busted, it could take a long time to get you re-patriated.  And there's no backup...  And you will share with them all your intel on Montoya...
Yes you do...
Okay.  You got the "item"?
25% discount on the load.
Really?  So, what is this, a party?
Nothing.  As in "free, gratis."
It goes very fast.
Off a little alley with cobblestones.  Hemingway went there...
"Probable"...applies to an event that may be real.  Doesn't apply here.
Exactly.
Cost less.  That's the point.
Zero risk.
I need thirty.  Calculate in, also, the cash you don't have to front...
Hola, viejo.
Do I need it?
I know.  And now?
What'd Neptune tell you?
Fifty-gallon drums.  Thirty-two.  A hundred kilos in each.  You transship that to the Malaysian boat.
Hey, Captain Kirk.  I think maybe I have second thoughts.
The honey trap.  And there's the honey.
What <u>you</u> get <u>from</u> us is a date.  A place.  "In the parking lot of a Jack-in-the-Box in north Miami."  At such-and-such time, an eighteen- wheeler will be there.  Keys in the ignition.  Ready to roll.  You pick it up.  And you drive it...  ...away.
You worried about the tree line, US Customs AWACS, or something else on your mind?
Gina in the Miami pad.  You gonna give me phony denials?
And what does that level of spending on first-class, private- sector infrastructure signify to you?
How do I discuss operations over an open line?
We don't know.
How do we do that?  Make a buy?  That went well...
From the North Valle area.  New. Low-level, we think.
Montoya.  We went to meet the village priest.  It turns into Alice in the fucking Vatican and here's the Pope...of the North Valle Colombia dope trade.
Alonzo?  What are you talking about?  Where are you...?
...what else, what else did he indicate to you?  I need to know everything he said.
We think NLR.  We don't know! Alonzo only fronted as a broker for our guys to make the meet.  He wasn't deep into the crew.
Yeah.
Yes.  What's up?
Good idea.  We'll grab a bite.
...even if they could run the identities you built to EPIC, all they'll find is more cover... Trust what you built.  It's quality, girl.  We're cool...
Slow and low, Adam A-500s...  ...carbon composite, stealthy, 1400 nautical-mile range, thousand ki payload...all the way to Caravels and 727's from a source country to a transshipment point.  Small freighters.  We've done containers...
Nothing.  'Cause how you do delivery on the beach, I don't like.  Maybe this does not work.
I had to lay eyes on you.
You work that out with La Senora.  You will get sixteen fuel bladders of crystal meth precursors from the Malaysian ship.  For collection in North Miami.  You warehouse it. Release it when we say.  I'm sure you have friends with fast boats...
Alonzo, you don't need to go home.
Funny thing, you mentioning money. I was just about to ask your for some...
I got me two hundred twenty-four bucks of flat folding money...  He know what he can do with that chicken-shit day's pay. And if he ain't man enough to do it for himself, I be happy to oblige!
Joking? No, ma'am. Oh no! I mean business!
You sure are a pretty lady.
I ain't sleepy.
Talking helps. Don't talk, you get muddled in your head. Hey! Now you just look at this here!
My friend O'Daniel. That's who you need. Operates the biggest stable in town. In the whole goddam metropolitan area. A stud like you - paying! -- not that I blame you -- a dame starts crying, I cut my heart for her...
Not a cent, I swear to God, I swear on my mother's eyes.
And end up a hunchback like my old man? You think I'm crippled? You shoulda caught him the end of a day.
Forty-second Street. Where'n hell you think it come from?
The name's Rico, at my own father's grave, a man deserves some respect.
Yeah, well, so?
Don't say nothing about you either.
Walk? Naturally I can walk.
No. But while you was buying the underwear, I could have lifted the socks.
And what?
I don't even want you to go. Whaddya think of that? I got other plans for my life than dragging around some dumb cowboy that thinks he's God's gift to women. One twenty-buck trick and he's already the biggest stud in New York City. It's laughable.
How'n hell a dumb Bronx kid like you know that?
Shee-it. You believe all you read?
I been thinking. I hope we're not gonna have a lotta trouble about my name down there. Because like what's the whole point of this trip anyway?
I mean New York's one thing, but can you see this guy, imagine it, running around the goddam beach all suntan and he's going in swimming, like, and then somebody yells 'Hey, Ratso' -- how does that sound to you?
I wet my pants! My seat's all wet.
You bet I do, sir.
Well, uh, I'm raring to go.
Get down -- where?
Instant V-goddam-D.
No. You got it.
I agree. And for that service I charge one dollar taxi fare.
Getchmis...?
...He had a bald skull and...
History, man, history. How much?
Could be ten or fifteen.  Maybe even twenty.
It's already built!  There's a basement substructure where they used to keep weapons and stuff, but beneath that there's these old catacombs that the Christians built 'bout a thousand fucking years ago to bury their dead.  We're sitting right on top of it -- here.
You want to split your hernia again?
Stop shitting me, man!
Bad. She couldn't make the trip. You know Her boy...  Susan told us before we got your letter. She's fine; she's trying to get the money to come back and see you, but...
For the money... )
I know.
Oh Jesus! 
Sure.
All over.  Turkish Army up there. It's against the law. They shoot us.  You sure you looking for your friends, man?
Ah, look!  they probably know where the campers are
Would you recognize him again?
But just...
Beats working.
...She was on the plane.
About as good as it looks.
How long?
Two thirty.
You know where it is?
What?
That's a great philosophy.
Mr. Yesil.
If I get bail, Mister Yesil, they say it's easy to cross the border into Greece?
Yeah, and a loudspeaker so you can yell "Epidemic! Epidemic! You're all going to die!"
Hey. I'm a short guy. Waddaya want?
Weird shit...?
Yeah, and you gonna have to show me a lot bigger one you wanna go down there. That's the old maintenance grid, Doc. Swiss cheese: tunnels, tracks...
Those things bring juice to the new stations.  You just can't rewire that shit...
All right, motherfucker, that's it.
Just do it!
Yeah, I feel like ripping your fucking eyes out...
"Mistake"?  What's that supposed to...?
The kid's with them!!
Peter, you couldn't even fix our TV!
What?
I'll be late.
No, there's...
Fine, then I'm the bad guy. Jesus!
I was just late.
Yeah, barely. We haven't found anything down here. Nothing...
Ah...
Peter...
That's it?
Gross. What is it?
I'm on it.  Don't worry.  Look, Susan...I don't mean to pry, but... I kinda overheard you and Peter.
I just...well, I had this cousin in Delhi.  She was having problems, too. She, ah...
Oh, Jesus.
What?
Anything you can tell me might help.
I could give you a couple of hundred pages of mine, and you could tell me what you think.
How long...?
Will I be able to walk?
I didn't know it was going to be a big storm.
It shouldn't be too much longer.  Once the roads are open, the lines'll be up in no time. If you give me their numbers, I'll keep trying them for you.  Could I ask you a favor?  I noticed in your case there was a new Paul Sheldon book and...  and I wondered if maybe... 
You'll never realize what a rare treat you've given me.
It's crazy, but I don't really know, I mean I haven't written anything but "Misery" for so long that--you read it you can tell me what you think it's about. Maybe you can come up with a title.
My daughter must be going nuts.
I was supposed to be home for her birthday three days ago.
I guess that means it's okay.
I know how that can be.
Well, it's not something you should enter into lightly.
No one--she just died--she slipped away, that's all.
I don't suppose I could have a little snack while I wait for the surprise?
You know, Annie, this book never would have survived without you. When it gets to new York, there will be a big auction, and whatever it brings we can split.  God knows you're entitled to it.
I know you didn't mean it when you killed her, and now you'll make it right.
You did great, except there's just one little thing--I can't work with this paper. It's Corrasable Bond, it smudges. Maybe you could go back into town and bring me some white, long-grained mimeo.
I thought you'd be interested. I'd like you to be in on everything, Annie. Not just the finished book, but how it's written.
No, just the paper will be fine.
I want my pills NOW!
I can't write this anymore.
You better. Oh, Paul, when Ian realized that the reason they'd buried Misery alive was because the bee sting had put her in that temporary coma--
The rain... sometimes it gives me the blues.
Why would you lose me?
What?
Three more chapters to go.
Maybe.
Maybe. Are you ready for the next chapter?
There's two kinds of people that drive around in old cars: the ones that can't afford new ones, and the ones who wouldn't give 'em up for anything in the world. That second bunch don't drive around with twenty- five-year-old dents.
Well, whoever she is, she sure likes to read a lot.
What?
That's nice.
Oh, I like that tone.
I'm sure you're right.
Buster.
We had a batch. Sold 'em all in three days.
Are you kidding? Every time that fella writes a book, she makes me set aside the first copy.
It's... it's nice, Paul. It's got... character.
No, no. Misery Chastain put braces on your daughter's teeth and is putting her through college, bought you two houses and floor seats to the Knick games and what thanks does she get? You go and kill her.
I am. Well, maybe not completely--
Not possible..
From her point of view or mine?
Oh, I am.  Later..
What else?
I knew where it was.
Yep.  You've provided us with a golden opportunity to have both the bug and the bug killer.
She wouldn't  be here if it wasn't for you, Hunt.  from this moment you're responsible for what happens to her, and if you're looking out for her well-being, I suggest you advise her to pick up the gun and bring it to me.  Ball's in your court, Hunt.  What've you got to say? Nyah's waiting for your answer.
More like two-two point two million.
Ninety-three point four million.
A myth..just a myth...shouldn't you be checking out their countersurveillance?
..or hard wired..
What are you talking about?
What manic invents  disease like that in the first place?  Why would he do it?
Right.
And the check's in the mall.
How much longer before you can reach him?
What if I pay the rent?
Think you're the only one who can pick a lock?
- torque wrench.
Hey, you put me here.  I just do what I'm told.
You didn't do that badly.
Hi.  Would you mind slowing down?
Your help?  What are you talking about?
They've got a book for everything.
Which is?
Of what?
You've either got it or you don't.  Let your conscience be your guide?
Look, would it make you feel better if I didn't want you to do this?
What wouldn't make him suspicious?
Affirmative.
Ethan, tell me -
I wasn't thinking!  Just..trying to keep you from getting hurt, that's all.
I guess I lied..You can't get both of us out of here, can you?
'You're sorry and I'm sorry.'
Then you do think it was Ambrose.
The question is why?  What was this Chimera Nekhorvich was carrying?
Well you know Nekhorvich's history. You're the one who got him out of the Soviet Union was it still in bio- weapon business.
Miss Hall and Ambrose had a relationship which he took very seriously.  She walked away and he's wanting her back ever since.  We believe she's our surest and quickest way of location him.
Go to bed with a man and lie to him? She's a woman.  She's got all the training she needs.
Yes, I believe that's right.  Now my understanding is that 20 hours after exposure, the victim becomes infectious. Highly infectious.
I'd thank you -- but I'm not sure that was a compliment.
Yes, I gathered as much.
Where is she now, by the way?  Do you know?
Right.  I guess there aren't many flu epidemics in the middle of summer.
Yep.
Left jacket pocket?
She must still be on the property.
Oh. Uh. Commencing diversion.  Alarm in cosmetics.
Ninety-seven minutes, twenty-seven seconds.
What's happening here?  You're dead!
By asking me.
I don't remember what happened!  We were at the bar, drinking, laughing -- having fun.
His name is.....Dimitri Miediev.
Good idea.
Ethan, if you knew about Jim?..Why..
All ten million.
Now we donit have to eliminate him?  You like that, donit you Claire?  Donit you?
May take a little time.
Krieger.
Don't move.
What happened to Jim?
Take off your coat.
Who is they, who is they?
Claire, Claire, Claire, if you're not dead, he's going to assume you're with me.
We need help, and we don't have time. They have to be local.
You are my eyes.  Stay with him.
Go secure.
Donit <u>think</u>, be <u>sure</u>.  Are you clean?
Heard a lot about you, Hunt.  Donit disappoint me.
Yeah.
But the list Golitsyn stole was a decoy.
Luther, relax, it's worse than you think. The terminal's in black vault lock-down.
Exactly, that's your job.  Tomorrow on the train, you can't let this list get out into the open.  What's the range of this thing?
I'll get you close.
Sure.  They want me back in so I won't break in!  They <i>still</i> can't figure out how we did it.
Why don't you come back with me?
You really liked Phelps, didn't you?
Even so, I'm sure you could arrange an introduction.
Done.  Bring it to me in London.  I want it by the end of the week.
My contact is extremely shy.
Jack.
Just waiting for you, tubs.
Roger that.  Opening doors now.
I'd say you've got about two minutes.
- and picked us up in the States -
We donit have to, Jim.  Heill come after us.
I was sitting in a cafe waiting for you and suddenly there she was, standing in the rain just outside the safe house..alive and beautiful..and thinking Iim dead and gone.  God knows what sheis had to do forget about me to keep going and get the job done, I..
Once we leave the safehouse, get in there and crash.  Iill call you from Paris.
I don't know.
Twenty minutes.
No, I'm going.
Hello, Bobo. How are you tonight?
You're not gonna marry him, Cosmo. Do you love him, Loretta?
He didn't used to be cheap. He thinks if he holds on to his money, he will never die.
No. You were there.
What's your news?
No! Bad luck! Your Ma and I been married fifty-two years an nobody died. You were married, what, two years, and somebody is dead. Don't get married again, Loretta. It don't work out for you. Who's the man?
I didn't give you away the first time.
Maybe.
He did?
Let's go tell your Mother.
You're my daughter. I won't have you acting like a tramp!
I like your dress.  It's very bright.
You have too many dogs.
You think so, huh, Stupid? Those dogs love each other.
Hurry up.
I'm going to marry him.
Yes. Do you want...
Excuse me.
I'm making you a steak.
Seven years ago.
Just Johnny.
You got any whiskey? How 'bout giving me a glass of whiskey?
Because I have no Luck!
I've never seen a moon like that.
What?
Take it easy.
All right, I'm guilty. I confess!
She didn't like me.
I can't!
I know what I know.
I don't know. Everything seems like nothing now against that I want you in my bed. I don't care if I burn in hell. I don't care if you burn in hell. The Past and Future is a joke to me now. I see that they're nothing, I see they ain't here. The only thing that's here is you. And me. I want you to come upstairs. Now. I tried to take everything last night, like you told me, but I couldn't. I couldn't take everything in a hundred years. It's the way we are. We compound each other.
No.
No.
No, I'll tell him.  What am I going to tell him?
Johnny.
What?
You propose to a woman you should offer her a ring of engagement.
I'll take care of it, Johnny. I'll take care of the whole thing. All you have to do is show up.
You have a brother?
How was your plane ride?
If I marry you my mother will die.
Where's the ring?
Johnny has a big apartment. We'll live there.
She's dying. But I could still hear her big mouth.
Not yet. That old lady makes him sweat.  Where's that card?
Well. I don't really know where to start.
Where's pop?
No more he's not.
I absolve you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, Amen.
I don't know.
If I hit the stick too hard, the apple will split. If I am too timid, the apple will fall off the stick.
That's incredible.
But why would a man need more than one woman?
I don't know.
You're forty-two years old, Johnny, and Mama is still running your life.
Sure!
I am alone in the world.
There's old saying my mother told me. Would you like to hear it?
Why do men chase women?
I teach these classes I've taught for a million years. The spontaneity went out of it for me a long time ago. I started off, I was excited about something and I wanted to share it. Now it's rote, it's the multiplication table. Except sometimes. Sometimes I'm droning along and I look up, and there's this fresh young beautiful face, and it's all new to her and I'm this great guy who's just brilliant and thinks out loud. And when that happens, when I look out among those chairs and look at a young woman's face, and see me there in her eyes, me the way I always wanted to be and maybe once was, then I ask her out on a date. It doesn't last. It can go for a few weeks or a couple of precious months, but then she catches on that I'm just a burnt out old gasbag and that she's as fresh and bright and full of promise as moonlight in a martini. And at that moment, she stands up and throws a glass of water in my face, or some action to that effect.
Yes.
Good night.
I live in a one-bedroom apartment. What exactly does your husband do?
Oh.
Shut up. They'll hear you in the back.
I knew she had it.
Does wood sink in water?
I am...  And this my trusty servant, Patsy. We have ridden the length and breadth of the land in search of knights who will join our court at Camelot..  I must speak with your lord and master.
Through ... We found them.
Please!
I'm not interested.
How d'you do, good lady ... I am Arthur, King of the Britons ... can you tell me who lives in that castle?
I am your king!
You don't vote for kings.
Who are they?
We shall say Ni! again to you if you do not appease us.
We want ... a shrubbery!
Ni!  Ni!  Ni ... Peng ... Nee ... Wum!
Now - go!
We are now no longer the Knights Who Say Ni!
I cannot tell you.  Suffice to say is one of the words the Knights of Ni! cannot hear!
I have no quarrel with you, brave Sir knight, but I must cross this bridge.
I command you, as King of the Britons to stand aside.
'Tis but a scratch.
What!  Just a flesh wound. 
Had enough ... ?
'Allo.  Whoo is eet?
My liege,  I am honored.
Bedevere, my Liege.
I do.  You seek the Holy Grail.
How shall we find this cave, O Tim?
I warned you!
Who did we lose?
:Well - I can't just say:  "Hey, Man!'
Well ... I AM king.
Yes, I see.
Be quiet!  I order you to shut up.
Shut up!
Come on, patsy.
My name is Sir Launcelot.
What is your quest?
Yes he is.
When's your next round?
That's all right.  See you on Thursday.
He hasn't got shit all over him.
What - the curtains?
I'm ... your son ...
Leaving the room.
Look, it's  simple.  Just stay here and make sure he doesn't leave the room.
No ....  keep him in here ... and make sure he doesn't ...
Yes.  It's not a very good name, is it?  But we are nice and we shall attend to your every ... every need!
I'm afraid our life must seem very dull and quiet compared to yours.  We are but eightscore young blondes, all between sixteen and nineteen-and-a-half, cut off in this castle, with no one to protect us.  Oooh.  It is a lonely life ... bathing ... dressing ... undressing ... making exciting underwear....
No, It's nothing!
Camelot ...
You've come to rescue me?
Yes!  With a herring!  With a herring!  Cut down with a herring!
Stop saying the word!  The word we cannot hear!  The word ...
Stop saying it.  AAAArghh! ... I've said it ...
Look.  I'm warning you.
Did I tell you?  Did you listen to me?  Oh no, no, you knew better didn't you?  No, it's just an ordinary rabbit isn't it.  The names you called me.  Well, don't say I didn't tell you.
She's hardly a full hamper herself.
The good-looking one.
They said you were drunk.  Why don't you tell her the truth?
It's a diary.
She needs me, Archie.  She canna do without me, she said it to my face.  How can I stop now?
I see.
I'm flattered you think so.
She's busy.
And that is my last word on the matter.
Back and upper corridors.
There are important papers from --
I am a blank sheet.
I've been called back to London.  My last day.  I thought I might take a walk on Lochnagar.
I don't think about it.
This is the top.
Maybe, once.
The greasy pole.
Archie.
Aye.  But there are Fenians reported on the mainland.
Yes, ma'am?
Yes, ma'am.
Yes, ma'am.
Oh, several things.
In so many ways ... and yet it is your presence they crave.  A figurehead.
No, she wasn't.
Yes.
I will not tolerate anybody lecturing me about the responsibility of the monarchy....
The same, your Majesty.
I have no idea.
I -- forgive me, ma'am, I am no wiser than yourself.
Getting there.  It's more sensitive than a joy-stick.  Your video-character can respond as fast as you can.  But what can I do for you?
It's a tough game.  Hard to pin that bastard down.  Keeps on changing the rules.
Sure.  Every game's got 'em.  I'll start with the schematics.  I can print these up if you want.
It's the game's logic core.  We actually patterned it after human brainwaves.  I mean, there's a personality in there. That's what makes it so incredible.
How'd you know it was us?
There's something wrong with ARCADE. The game's alive somehow...
What the hell does that mean?
Guess he took off...  You have his keys, right?
Yeah...
We are talking...
Greg never came home.  A few hours is one thing, Nick, but this is different. Something's happened to him.
I'm in the middle of it...
What?
Like the fractals?
...but then it hits the relay stations...
Give me a break, Alex.  What are we going to tell them?  Excuse me, officer, but there's some sort of electronic monster loose in the phone lines.  I'd think twice about calling any of those 976 numbers...
I don't know.
I can't believe you made it!
You didn't hear me?
Put in a quarter.
Yes I am...
There...
There never is.
Never been on a snowboard.
Not yet, honey...
The game will guide you.
I'm going home.
You gotta be kidding?
There is no problem.
No problem. What's on your mind?
Okay, I'm thinking.
Look ... where's this going? What do you want me to do?
That's fine, Mr. Kesher. You can pay cash when you check out. I'm sorry. it was my duty to inform you.
Yes, he is. He raises corn.
I was afraid of that.
It's all right gorgeous. Something wrong?
I'm Ruth's niece. My name's Betty. I'm sure she told you I was coming.
Yeah ... Betty. You don't rush it. I don't rush it. We play it close, just like in the movies.
Diane?
I don't know who I am.
What do you mean?
You don't remember anything else?
Mulholland Drive?
Maybe that's where the accident was. There must be a police report. We could call.
We could call anonymously from a pay phone... just to see if there was an accident.
Just to see if there was an accident on Mulholland Drive.
Not that I can see.
Maybe it's not me.
"My parents are right upstairs! They think you've left..."
"You know what I want...it's not that difficult."
Good luck!
Okay.
Do you know them?!
What ... I..HAVE... to do.
No, no, no, I told you. They're fine. They're all real happy.
Nothing... I don't like being out in the open like this.
I just wanted to come here.
Yeah.
Where at?
Yeah, look at my digs ... times are tough.
Sure, reach in my shirt pocket there.
Great ! You couldn't be a fan of Dolphins or some other less threatening animal.
What's going on ?
I made this place..... now listen to me. I'll get out of this room, we have bigger troubles than this....
I'm leaving.
You've been doing a bang up job so far. Right now Matt is probably dead and it's your fault.
I just graduated from M.I.T. in engineering. That's when John McCay hired me.
I was hired in and started to do the boring old work routine. I was originally brought in as a technical advisor. First Bank had sponsored my scholarships.
What do you mean ?
This is New York. No one notices anyone. Not even when someone disappears. At first it was the guy who was caught trying to steal McCay's Jag. Then it was dirty accountants that tried to walk away with millions. The Old Man got such a rush from it, I thought that he would start trying to send me people who used the copier after hours.
What do you do with the company, if I might ask ?
Know what ? That it was your fault ?
Okay.
Yeah, real cute. The storm is fake, but the lightening is real.
The Brooklyn Bridge.
That's a shame.
Well, I'll see you at the next staff party.
Yes, can I help you ? Maybe a donut or something ?
I did, but this room has four exits and only one opens, it's up to them in the control room. There's one right over there. The exit light is on, but he can change it.
A dragon.
Are you hunting wabbits ?
You were one of those guys that played Dungeons & Dragons with real swords, weren't you.
Yeah, we're about a hundred an fifty feet below the subway stations. We're heading a little higher up now.
That's cute asshole.
What the fuck are you talking about.
Almost. Look, you two get out of here.
Let's just see if he can make it into round two....
What ?
Not yet.
You've got it boss. One more mangled body to the East River, coming up !
RESPECT is earned not given away, trust is given away to anybody.
He probably has a history of this shit.
Yeah, but we're talking 43.
For once in your life, shut the fuck up.
If you want, I can fire you and have someone else who has the balls terminate these worthless people. Which will it be ?
Thank you, sir.
Yes sir. It turns out we put an innocent man into the "park" and he was not the one who stole from the stamp machine. That is also about the time when Bruce began refusing.
What do you mean sir ?
Sir, he created the Park. He would know how to circumvent any of the traps.
What then sir ? What would we do with the park with out Bruce ?
Have that tape on my desk tomorrow morning.  First.... thing...
I'm just looking for our best interests. May I have the tapes, Bruce ?
We have new "guests" for the park. I have a file on them. May I see Bruce ?
What are you looking for ? A blow job ?
Then what do you want ?
We should have another fifteen minutes at least.
I don't know.....
He'll never make it out of the park alive. I promise you that....
I'll see that bet.
Why ? The crocks are all going for the dead crock. There's no fun in it. Besides we've got plenty more for them. The night is young....
Thank you.
Excuse me, gentlemen
Yes.
Like what, a Porsche ? A Ferrari ?
Zach from work ?
I was thinking maybe we should try this dinner thing again, but maybe the Epcot version will be open by then....
Who was that guy anyway ?
Oh, just put it over there.
UCLA? My cardigan sweater period.
Ohhhhh.
Oh I doubt it...lectures are notoriously boring.
Your Uncle Phil told me.
Don't mention it.
I thought I told you to lose this guy.
I think the phrase was &quot;Sleazoid Geek&quot;.
Me, I'll know!
Hello, I'm gonna need this right now...this guy...well we think he might be going after the governor.  Twenty minutes? Fine.
Dad, I'm trying.  The chairs, they won't scrunch.
She told me too, I mean, she told me she told you about sex, I personally new about sex long before I met Shelly.
Was it a nice funeral?
And no boys, promise me, oh those LA people are all so corrupt you'll end up pregnant and on drugs...and don't come running to me when you wake up in the city morgue with a tag on your toe having been beaten up into an unrecognizable pulp by some surfer...and DON'T make eye contact, it communicates an implied vulnerability.
It means...I'm a paranoid nitwit who's never let his baby girl out of his sight for the simple reason he's a paranoid nitwit. So why don't you just say &quot;Oh Dad&quot; and get on the damn plane already?
Yes I know, it runs in the family.  New book?
She is not a child Harry, she is a young woman, she's on the brink of...
Oh.  Ohhh?
Oh honey, back then...people did crazy things.
I am Vada Margaret Sultenfuss. My mother was...
You are?
Hillary Mitchell? How's she?
I'll try.
I've got something better.
I thought that...umm...maybe you'd be curious about how I turned out.
I guess what I mean is, my mother married my dad after you...and then I was born, so I thought that...maybe you got divorced because of me.
Oh God, he's coming over here, act natural, totally natural.
No-one invented gravity, it just exists.
It's no problem, I had a mother once myself.
O.K. Thank you very much.
My mother.
You're so clever.
MOM!
TAXI!!!
I wasn't eavesdropping, I was overhearing.
What difference does it make?
I love the fragrance of chilidogs.
I'd never do that.
You would.
May I use the phone please.
He is one of the great poets.
Well, it doesn't open cans or anything but it...it's sort of a reminder of a friend of mine.
Well, I hope he's not watching me all the time.
Jerk! You IDIOT!!!
What do you think?
Like what?
I wouldn't say it was terrible...it was...kind of...
I'd consider it a personal favor.
Rose this not the place to be having this...
He was very polite, worth the entire five dollars.
Ahh, that's right, like one big happy family. This is Nick's room and uhh....
Dating, seriously dating. You're thirsty, want something to drink? Sure you do, it's been a long trip.
That's ridiculous, I'm...I'm very, umm, what do you call it?
I'll do better than that. I'll send you off with your own private guide.
I don't know, he's got an awful lot on his mind right now.
Phil for God sake.
Anyone with taste, anyone with breeding.... A gentleman, would choose British racing green, with maybe a tan interior...but when you buy a red car, with a black interior and wire wheels, you have one thing on your mind and one thing only and I'm too much of a gentleman to say what that one thing is...in front of the children.
Nothing, nothing at all.
I'm a pediatric cardiologist.
Yes, I do.
You couldn't?
Oh no.
But what about you and the baby? You need me.
How do I know you were gonna show us one?
WHAT?
This guy bonking you?
Yeah, all right...
My __EX__ wife seems to have ripped off my camper.
No.
Oh, wait relax now, let me look, let me look, come up here and we'll have a look.
Uhh, Miss devoto, these people are already at ease. This is not a Beauty Parlor, it's a Funeral Parlor.
Deceased.
You'd be doing hair and makeup and answering the phone.
She did. This photo was taken a month ago at the church food drive.
Oh that, she just likes to play.
She was raised in a funeral home, she knows a thing or two about it.
Excuse me Harry, I'm sorry, I just wanna let you know that the flowers were delivered. And the room's all set up.
Okay.
Okay, sure.
I don't know, tonight you just seemed a little cool, not opening car doors and...
Is there enough room?
Old Spice, Phil says it's a timeless classic.
Perfect.
O.K. Sweetie, hand me the mayonnaise out of the fridge.
Then who's it for?
You never cared before.
Soon honey, soon.
Yes, I did, very much for a long time, and even now, I get a little sad when I think of a pretty flower or a sunset that your mother would have liked.
That's good, memories are good sweetheart. Vada, I'm sorry; I was trying to keep it from you, I just couldn't. You're a good girl, and I want you to be happy; don't be an old grump like me.  Seeya in the morning.
Nothing, I'm dressing.
The last date I had was twenty years ago.
Oh, I'm running late. Shelly'll be here any minute.
Look if you think you know how, why don't you pre-measure the briquettes in little packages, put out a product, support me for a while!
Pause as he takes all this in I think your Dad would miss you.
Now when I see him with Shelly, sometimes he seems like the old Harry.
Well he wasn't one of the Marx brothers, but he made me laugh.
I am.
I'm not upset. I will never play with those girls. I only surround myself with people who I find intellectually stimulating.
Chocolate?
It's a mood ring, it tells what mood I'm in.
Well you don't know that. Ask him.
My ball, I lost my ball.
Can we look around in your camper?
Thomas?
Can I use your bathroom first?
Have you ever tried any?
Yes, Vada I think you're very pretty. You've got these great big sparkling eyes, the cutest little nose, an amazing mouth.
Uh huh, i've been trying to get out to Hollywood for years to do makeup for all the stars, I haven't gotten there yet.  All right, open your eyes.
Uh huh, why?
This is Danny and Ralph, they own the Dino Raphael salon in Detroit.  We used to be married.
Oh great!!
I'm allergic to it.
It's only black when you're around 'cause you put me in a bad mood.
You could pick that scab on your arm.
No.
That was Grammoo's. It's a phrenology chart, they used to study the bumps in your head to see if you had a good personality or not. Come here, i'll diagnose your head.
What?
Hey, where does it say that?
I think, everybody gets their own white horse, and all they do is ride and eat marshmallows all day, and everybody's best friends with everybody else, when you play sports, there's no teams, so nobody gets picked last.
Duck!
What?
What?
So?
My mood ring! It fell off! I gotta find it!
But I have my clothes on!
Hi, wanna ride bikes?
No, I'm hiding out.
Hi Vada, can you come out?
Umm, Ummmmm
Well, let's spit on it.
Okay, seeya.  Vada?
Well, then, I'll take it up with her.
If your ass isn't chapped, you are not a good-writer of note.
Solid and genuine is not boring. Michael can be completely insane...
He says, "Swear.  When we're both 28, if we've never been married... we marry each other!"
Desperate.  To talk.
Then why are you compulsively eating? If you're not hysterical?
No, he's ruining yours.
I can see why.
And you believe that.
I KNOW THAT!  I WAS DISTRACTED BY GRIEF!
I wish.
What do you suggest?
It's too late to start over.
Tell him you've loved him for nine years, but you were afraid to realize it.
Can you watch the road?
Not you.  You won't be comfortable unless you're distinctive.
... garden sports, all.  Little swing of maybe fifty degrees Fahrenheit, represents a packing challenge, but there's fine food and cocktails at a choice of Embassy Suit...
A trademark move, don't touch it.
I was gonna predict that.
Ju...
... best valley in New Zealand, best... women's shoes...
Oh, that.  I forgot I even said th...
... whatever is manly and independent.
Hello.
That's entirely understandable.
... look good on Kimberly.
Nice meeting you, too, Walt.
I hope so.  This is all too mysterious to waste on just me.
Then it could all come out, sooner or later.  Nobody should be in on this.  Just you and me.  Or, more correctly, I.
I need to make some calls. Could I use... your office?
Yeh, well my old machine kept eating messages.  I tried constructively ignoring it in hopes of improvement, but finally...
Well, somet...
... Thomas, yeh.
Mirrors.
Such as.
She finds him "personable."
Firenze.
What, leaving school...
If you like.
You've been the man in mine.
ISN'T THERE A GUARD?  A JANITOR? A FUCKING CLEANING WOMAN? I'LL TAKE A BURGLAR!  SOMEBODY'S GOTTA BE IN TH...
No, it's for the best, it really is.  We were so wrong for each other.
Nellie Fox.  Walter likes the past.  And he likes the little guys.
This is the dumbest thing I will ever do.  So dumb, in fact, that I can't.  I don't think.
The pus that infects the mucous that cruds up the fungus.
I travel every week.  College ball, motor sports, training camps...
To the twins' soiree?  So they can paw you and drool...?
No, it's, uh... a real big favor.
... and you knew about this.
What is that sup...
Yes. I'm cutting a record.
What's wrong honey.
Oh just about everything, I guess. Those doctors started on an overhaul and don't want to quit. They keep taking things out. She's going to come home an egg shell. Tough, though.. She's tough.
Thank you-- Yes, I am.
Barnett, John Triplette. How's she doing?
He knows better.
Whose word?
They can come to the concert in the park.
You know better than that.
Okay.
Hi. Come on in. Mary!
Whose?
President.
Okay.
How come?
Harvard?
Yes, ma'am. How are you today?
Oh... a little of both. Just thought I'd look around at Nashville for a while.
I'1l get your bag.
Did an exploratory and according to them, she needed an overhaul.
What did you say?
I see... Well, those doctors are real miracle workers.
Replacement party.
A guy named Walker. Amazing person. He's developed a huge following.
Well I've been following him around Just listening to him --He says he can really win -- I bet he can too - -
Well, he's really amazing.
I'm in a hurry, gonna see this great group record at Woodland.
No. Probably stay at a motel tonight.
Do you carry door handles?
How are you going to pay when you get sick?
Worst time at year for dogs is when they get fungus.
Does their hair fall out?
But, I'll take some of that Nyquil... you know it puts you right to sleep no matter what's wrong, you go right off...
Yes -- yes, they have. It was a real shock at first, especially since my daddy's a preacher, but Delbert and I have been blessed by their being here.
Linnea?
Remember, about a month ago, your church choir cut a record?
Who is this, right?  I called you last night.
I have to go. He sighs.
Oh.
What?
Out.
They're looking all over for you. Do you have a copy of the album.
Mary?
Did it break?
How long have you been together?
We're connected by a relative. One time, one of his aunts married one of my uncles. That was a long time ago, though. How'd you come to work for him?
He ain't really new.
He was a good Judge, but that was a long time ago.
I'll be damned. Boy, if you could get Ryan to say something about Hal Phillip Walker, wouldn't that be something?
Well, you just remember, if you can't kick front, kick back, 'cause at least you're kicking... Ten minutes, okay?
Is that good?
Well, honey, I sure hope it comes your way then.
Sure thing.
May I see your costume?
Yes, I would.
What...
Apple, pecan, cherry, and key lime.
The key lime is great, but it's an acquired taste.
It wasn't 'till we got on the ground floor that I totally realized they weren't gonna shoot unless we shot first. When we got out of the stairwell, I remember thinking, 'Oh my God. This might work.' But Mickey knew it would work all along. There wasn't any doubt in his mind. It's not like there was and he just didn't show it. He knew it would work.
We had nothing to do with that riot. That riot was just -- whatchmacallit --
Now that you bring it up, yes. They were different men. I hadn't really thought that much about it. Since many psychiatric opinions are, by a rule, sought out for this kind of situation. What do you think normally happens? The Knoxs are assigned a family psychologist that takes care of them throughout the rest of their lives? The state doesn't work like that.
Thank you, sir.
Five inmates, eight guards and one psychiatrist all in one year's time... Very good. You do keep up with the headlines.
By all means.
She's in the holding cell, on this floor.
She was born without a tongue.
Tough titty, it's mine now.
Ready.
Don't worry about it.
Aside from the obvious?
Excuse me, did you say an instant of purity? What was the instant of purity? The bodies you left behind on your bloody trail?
It's not that easy, Wayne. Donuts and a smoke only get you so far. You're gonna have to do your job.
Yeah, we have a van.
Out front.
So, what now?
I said I'd give you a interview. Now unless I'm mistaken, we just did a interview.  We did an interview, didn't we?
We are.  Your camera.
NO!!!
Have you seen 'Pumping Iron?'
He squashed him mentally before physically defeating him.
Mickey stops sawin' on my leg and says, 'Oh my God, I'm your biggest fan!'
They were especially influenced by 'Conquering Huns of Neptune.'
They actually apologized.
It's hard to say Capt'n.
This is Raymond Burr witnessing the destruction of Tokyo by Godzilla.
You should see the other bitch. What time you got?
Yeah. Bus is all gassed up and ready to roll.
Would the network really not run it without the interview?
Perfecto!
Fucking dammit! Mickey hold onto that thought. Reload, quick!
But you'll never be whole again.
Same here. Let me introduce my crew. Scott...Roger...and Unruly Julie ...this is...I'm sorry. What's your title again?
Is that her real name?
Really?
Well...small world. Well, then, you know firsthand how Hollywood does things. Lights all over the place, generators, a hundred and fifty crew members---
Okay. I'll take two guys off.
Fine.  Julie, why don't you make a food run?  What's around here?
Thanks, Duff. You' a nice guy. Not like Frankie.
Out.
You think so, Frankie?
That'll be thirty-eight cents.
I still don't know what you're talkin' about.
I'll smile when it's funny.
What did you say your name is?
Guess you must be lookin' after my boy. I'm Duff Anderson.
I been sendin' her money.
I ain't so sure of that. If I was, maybe I'd feel different.
Okay.
'That right? I thought he was up North.
Name's Duff.
Okay.
I don't know. Forty-eight, I guess.
Yeah, I been there.
Why don't you come over for a beer when you get through?
Oh yeah? That's my home town.
No. My mother's dead.  You goin' back inside?
Look, I don't know what you been told 'bout section gangs, but how 'bout seein' me sometime?
What d'you expect?
No thanks.
Take it easy.
Well, my mother was the only good teacher the colored school ever had. Nobody bothers with those kids.
It's hard to see any change. But I'm going to stay. Another year, anyway.
Well, either we're gonna hit the hay or get married. Now you don't want to hit the hay, and I don' want to get married.
All right, so I'm primitive. So what d'you want with me?
No.
Okay, I guess.
She don't mean nothin' to me. That's all over.  Hell, baby - I'm askin' you to marry me. I guess you want a big scene, huh?
Yeah, that's so.
Smells like something crawled in there and died.
Come here, baby.
You didn't answer my question.
Uh-huh. Why?
I don't want to hurt you.
You jivin' me?
I keep thinking about him.
Hell, baby - I met this beautiful chick and she's just dyin' for me, okay?
Don't ask, baby - huh!  How much money you got with you?
What d'you mean?
Duff--
How 'bout the key?
You gonna sit at home the rest of your life? Jesus!
What's eatin' you, Jocko?
'Bye, Jocko.
What's the matter? Don't smell so good, huh? Must'a broken some records.
He's been hitting it pretty hard. Got high blood pressure, too. I guess it's hard on him, having you around.
No, they won't.
I can always chop cotton if I have to.  If you want a ride, I'll take you home.
Thank you.
I doubt it.
Don't look like there's a right way.
Oh yeah?
Man, why 'you messin' around with a gal like that? You won't get no place.
Hell, I didn't know you was married.
Hi.
Nothin'.  She's all right. Wouldn't have made it without her. Christ - haven't worked in eight months. Right now, I'm waitin' for some insurance money. And man, when I get it, I got plans to make me some more.  Let's get out'a here. This place gives me the willies.  You got some money?
I will.  Inside.  There's no other way to get the gun off the girl's head, Nate.
Bathroom. But he's nowhere near it.
No. I only needed the code from you.
He wants to kill you, you know... Perhaps I won't allow it.
Play it straight with me and you've got nothing to worry about. When it's over, I inject you with the antitoxin.
An Artificial Intelligence. A computer system that's developed the capacity for sentient thought. They're dangerous and totally unpredictable.
I was set up.  She looked at least eighteen.
You son-of-a-bitch, you're crazy.
This one's different. No one can trace it. It's out there somewhere in the matrix and it's growing stronger... infecting other computer systems like a virus.
It hasn't yet.
I cannot tell a lie. Sorry.
The old man cheats on his wife with her own clone?
This ain't Bangkok, chief.
I find out now.
I prefer distrusting you. It'll keep us honest.
Are you even really alive?
Ah, yes... the code. It's a riddle, actually. Some fancy of 3Jane's. Unfortunately, you'll have to find out for yourself. I can no more know that code than I can shut down my own hard wired defences. Now, our time is running short... and you haven't even touched your drink.
Fine, Ratz. Thanks.
Yeah. That was me.
Can you walk?
You're Dixie McCoy's construct. That makes you something special.
I need its matrix coordinates, Dixie. I've got to nail that thing where it lives.
Those guys couldn't even find their own dicks with tweezers and a magnifying glass.  Tell you what, Bro. I'll make you a deal. I help you nail this A.I., you gotta do me one favour.
How are we doing?
That's pretty good cause he's only working with one lobe.
Wintermute could have infiltrated that machine. Reprogrammed him.
So it does business through a brain dead marine and runs the stock market for funding. That means Wintermute hired us to fry itself. It doesn't make sense.
No. It's gotta be more than that. That hard wiring also keeps it from getting too smart. Too powerful.
We run. You crack the pattern?
I'll let it access me. That'll give you a free shot. Make it a good one. Dix.
Not for long. It needs me alive and I still need its access code. You got a better idea?
How long, Dixie?
Don't worry, Dix. I'm on a roll.
It's coming.
Then I'll fry taking this son of a bitch out. I'm making the run, Dixie.
This time it's different. Someone ripped of a shipment of hallucinogens. Five grams of liquid ketamine. It was supposed to be Jo Jo's score.
And Linda...
Shut down your ice patterns. I'll take you out.
I'll give it my best shot, mother fucker.
Why should I want to meet him.
... a friend of mine's gonna get herself killed. I need my clip.
Then, fuck you. I'm gone.
What's that supposed to mean?
Almost two days.
So you're a wire junkie.
A regular Fagan.
Dixie McCoy didn't.
...Yeah, but the Hosaka's history.
Put the gun down, Case.
They'll cut you down.
Yeah... Yeah, I'm fine.
Something exotic I hope.
No. It's important to be able to feel those things.  We're going to pull this run off, Molly, and we've got to do it soon.
Surviving, darling. It's my specialty. Only this time I'm doing it my style. I've beaten him, you know.
Perversity, darling. The enjoyment of the gratuitous act. Tough to manipulate someone who doesn't give a flying fuck.
I'm Josie. Aldys is an interesting name.
This one has been so hyped. We're tied for most wins with Northglen North. This year's winner will determine the winner of the century. The theme is everything. So whatever Southglen picks has to be totally unique--
Listen, I don't have any plans-- you want some help?
I thought this was a 45-minute seminar.
I've kissed guys. I've just never kissed a guy. Felt that thing--
No - It's just a lot of pressure for your first piece, that's all. I mean, it's not a half-page article, it's a major undercover piece, Jos. Look what Rigfort did to Dutton - and that guy's his cousin!
Jos, that's not what we're --
I am not letting you out of the house in that, young lady.
Hidden camera.
Can I just say--I totally love Ex- Lax.
Why?
Betty.
You know what separates us office flunkies from the reporters?
A flack jacket.
Every Tom, Dick, and Harry thinks he can write. But a journalist gets in there, right where the bombs are. He's aggressive. Grabs the bull by the balls.
But I don't want it straightened out.
Oh. Right.
Kristen got a quote?
There is no lid! Nothing's going on between Sam and me. Coulson. Mr. Sam Coulson and me.
Yeah, you gonna be there?
I already checked. There are some pretty serious couples in there.
Maybe because we're not supposed to be having sex with bananas.
She just needs a new windshield wiper.
Someday this luau is going to be all mine!
I got an assignment from the paper. I'm going undercover. Back to high school.
This is it Jos! This is my ninth inning! The game isn't over--I just thought it was!  I get on the Southglen baseball team, the right scout sees me-- I'm into the minors- it's game time!
Rufus?
Thanks. And what are -
I-
College. Haven't really thought about it.
Thanks. Wow. That's--really nice to hear.
You remember that story?
I shouldn't say that, because I'm your teacher.
But Humpty Dumpty was alone.
Do you think you'll find her?
Thanks. So do you.
Why?
It's really hard to do. Some kids try for all of-high school and never make it.
We're very evolved.
Lock.
<i>                      Jack said we should work together.</i>
No!
Didn't I tell you?  I'm always right, you know, my dear... Aren't I?
I'm grown up now.  I have to leave some time.
He stayed a long time.
I'm Jesse now, Lisa.
I want him back.  Jesse, talk to me. Jesse!
She's a neighbor, I drive her to school.
Not too far.  My folks bought a place over on Elm Street.
Only the wet ones.
How come?
That's okay, I wanted to.
Yeah, yeah, sure.
Who, Grady?  Grady's alright, he's just a hothead.
Yeah.
Yeah?
Like a haunted house, right?  I don't believe in ghosts.
I don't know.  Concentrate or some- thing.
Shhh.  Just concentrate.
Uh-uh.  Wait...
About what?
Oh, Jesse...
We'll figure it out together.  We'll stay up all night if we have to.  I won't let anything happen to you.
he's just waiting to take me.  When I sleep.
We must look like a couple of escapees from a veterans' hospital.
Okay, I guess.
Sure...go ahead.
All of them.
Okay...thanks.
Thanks, Mom.
Hi Mom.
It's okay, I'm not tired.  Really.
Mom?
I thought I'd wait for you.
I had such an awful dream.
Morning, Doctor Goldman.
No, she's right.
He's close...
I think new York was just what I needed.  So many people.  I never feel alone.
It's an amazing gift.
I think so.
I'm so proud of you all.  Tell Neil I...
Those are ancient history.
Fuck off.
It's been a long time.
I lost too much over this already.  I'm through with it.
We lost a kid about a month ago to Fairview.  I don't know where he got the razor...but he cut off his own eyelids to stay awake.
Never been here before?
I'm sorry, Nancy.  The answer is no.
Do you think we can get the Hypnocyl in by tomorrow?
Doesn't matter.
Try me.
This isn't possible.  And even if it is...what the hell am I doing here?  Did you drag me in here too?
There's nothing we can do.  It's out of our hands.
I'll be okay.  Just give me a minute.
No...
Just go.  Kristen needs you.  Keep her awake somehow.  Do it.
Sshhh.  No time for that.  Come on.
What about Kristen?
What?
Purgatory...fashioned by the hands of men.  Twisted, lost souls, the worst of the criminally insane, were locked away in here like animals.
That girl was Amanda Krueger.  Her child --
This is stupid.
Yeah?  What did we ever do?
Oh sure.  That's just the sorta thing parents tell their kids:  "Goodnight honey.  Don't forget ot say your prayers. Oh, by the way, your father and I torched some maniac last night."
Where...here?
Hi.  Good Lord -- you're the spitting image of...
Oh, it's just down the corridor on the right.
I'm a vegetarian.
I'm delighted.
Night, night, Honey.
I'm not listening.
Well, they can be.
You're welcome and, may I also say... heavenly.
And what happens next in the dream?
That's fine.
Yes, you did.
You said 'whoopsidaisies.'
There's no 'unless.'  No one has said "whoopsidaisies" for fifty years and even then it was only little girls with blonde ringlets.
Step aside.
She left me.
Come in.
'No, turn over 4 TRS's and tell them we need radar feedback before the KFT's return at 19 hundred -- then inform the Pentagon that we'll be needing black star cover from ten hundred through 12.15' -- and don't you dare say one word about how many mistakes I made in that speech or I'll pelt you with olives.
Damn.  'And Wainwright...'
The ice cream or Mel Gibson's bottom?
Well, thank you.  Anyway -- time for bed.  Or... sofa-bed.
Okay.
No seriously.  I mean, they're just breasts.  Every second person in the world has got them...
Who was Gilda?
That's not true.  And wait a minute... this is crazy behavior.  Can't we just laugh about this?  Seriously -- in the huge sweep of things, this stuff doesn't matter.
I mean -- today's newspapers will be lining tomorrow's waste paper bins.
Okay.
You expect me to tell the truth about my life to the most indiscreet man in England?
I haven't decided.
He wouldn't say.
And this is William.
Anna Scott?
The movie star?
Why not -- all that awaits me at home is a masturbating Welshman.
Tony -- what do you think?
It was sort of sweet actually -- I mean, I know she's an actress and all that, so she can deliver a line -- but she said that she might be as famous as can be -- but also... that she was just a girl, standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her.
Well, yes.  Groovy.
Hun -- this is Anna.  Anna -- this is Honey -- she's my baby sitter.
Well, thanks, that's great.
Good move: when all is said and done, she's nothing special.  I saw her taking her pants off and I definitely glimpsed some cellulite down there.
Oh great.  Could you do me a favour and try to get us some really cold water up here?
I'm sorry.  I didn't get down what magazines you're from.
Ah... yes, enormously.
But Ringo Starr doesn't look anything like Topol.
Right.  It's not a classic anecdotes, is it?
Okay.  Tell me, would I have to pay a wet rag as much as I pay you?
Can you tell her I'll ring her back.
Okay -- perfect timing as ever -- hold the fort for a second will you, Martin?
Hello, Anna ahm...  Scott -- have some wine.
She's perfect, perfect.
That's not fair.
Is it someone we know?
I'm sorry, we don't have anyone of that name here, sir.
And then double it -- and that is the -- what can I say -- git I'm living with and he cannot remember...
Or Bambi... or, I don't know, Beavis or Butthead?
This is important in comparison to, let's say, whether they should cancel third world debt?
Hi...
Right.  Vicious circle.  And then I was like rooting around in your things, and found this, and I thought -- cool. Kind of spacey.
Ahm let's see -- ahm.  No.  Gone completely.  Oh no, wait.  There was -- one from your mum: she said don't forget lunch and her leg's hurting again.
Absolutely no idea.  Remembering one name's bad enough...
What?
Okay -- okay.  Might be too late, but okay.
Get out, Spike.  I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry.  Which hospital?
Yes.
So?
I haven't got a book down my trousers.
Yes, that's perfectly correct.
Yes, Miss Ratched, this is correct.
I-I-I-I c-c-c-came over S-S-S Sunday m-m-m-morning after ch-ch-ch church and br-br-brought her s-s some flowers, and I s-s-said, I said, 'C-C-C-Celia, will you muh muh-muh-muh-muh...' till the girl broke out l-l-laughing.
Sorry, ma'am.
Mister McMurphy, there are old men here who couldn't hear the music at all if it were lower. That music is all they have, and I wish you wouldn't lean against the glass there, your hands are staining the window.
No, that's okay, ma'am. Down it goes.
I'm sorry, Mister McMurphy, but you must have a majority to change ward policy.
Mr. McMurphy, you had no right to take these men out with you!
Thank you, ma'am.
H-H-Harding, the m-m-man w-wants to t-talk to you, y-you're the pr-pr pr...
Th-th-then y-y-you're n-n-not m-m mad?
'K-k-kay, Mack!
H-Hey, M-Mack.
Soo, fare-the-weel, darlin'. I'm gone on my way, My wagons are loaded, My whip's in my hand...
P-p-p-please duh-duh-duh-duh t-t tell, M-M-M-Miss R-R-Ratched, y-y you don't need to!
God Bless America.
Yeah...
Wow! They're so quiet.
Where ya goin', Mac?
Yeah!
Tell 'er to go straight to hell!
We'll go back just as soon as we find those guys! 'Kay?
Lobotomy?
With your own two hands?
Plan?... Oh, yeah, the plan... Yeah...
Sure, Mack...
No!
I'm not running a charity ward...
Can you borrow me a dime?
Whadaya bet, Cheswick?
In what way?
Come on, Doc, you know as well as I do what's been comin' down in that loony bin.
I'm afraid not.
No, Mister McMurphy, it's just that we cannot offer you the guidance and assistance that you would receive at Pendleton.
What's the horse pill for, honey?
Look, miss, I don't like swallowing something without knowing what it is!
I want you to write me a letter to my brother for a hundred dollars to bury me.
Yeah, yeah, you're a fucking phony, McMurphy!
I don't believe it...
I tell ya, there's an angel of mercy standing out there, Turkle.
Yeah, that's a good idea, Turkle. Why don't ya take Rose on a little tour of our facilities...
Hi ya, big boy? How's it goin'? Like it in here?
He's in charge.
I don't have any.
I'm sure you will.
Oh...
Thank you, ma'am,
Tha's your problem.
Jus' playin' the game, sucker...
Yes, Miss Ratched!
Ah guess the natives are restless, ma'am...
Is he one of the loonies?
Don't you sweet talk me you ol' spook, you!
No, she wasn't my sister.
I-- I must've misplaced it.
You don't understand.  The man I'm supposed to marry is on that plane.
It was late in arriving.  But it's here now.
What for?
No.
I feel like I've been wandering in the desert for as long as I can remember.  With nothing but emptiness around me, wind and sun...  And suddenly, out of the blue, somehow I've found the oasis.
It just happened.  I didn't plan it.  I was alone.  And he was... there.  But now everything's changed.  I owe it to him to let him know.  I need to tell him.
Your great aunt.
Dwayne?
Ask her if she knows where he is?
If I live here, then he lives here. Fate wouldn't make a mistake like that.  And stop talking.  You're gonna ruin the spell.
No.
Faith, this guy you think is Mr. Right, he's... not what you think--
But, Faith--
No, you gave a very convincing performance.  And you'll be pleased to know that your eight-by-ten glossy is now on display at the local playhouse.
Right.  Thanks a lot.  And congratulations.  It's not easy finding love these days.
Well, he'd have to hurry.  My flight leaves at four o'clock.
Huh?  Uh, yeah-- I've gotta run. Tell Dwayne hi.  Maybe someday we can all get together.
Yes.
You didn't answer my question.
So it wasn't real.
Because.  I know where he is.
Where's Positano?
Tell me.
Right now?
You found him.  I don't know how to thank you.
I just wanted to keep an eye on you.  The guy's a total stranger, remember?
No.  Course not.
Hi.  Are you... busy?
Are you asking me out?
I just need to run up and get my bathing suit.
No one had to tell me.  He's starring in the local play.
Gee, I'm flattered.  What an incredibly romantic gesture. Cancel the roses, I've decided to lie to her instead.
There is no us.
Okay.  Good.  See you then, then.
Brunello di Montalcino, '85, please.
Hmmmm... Well, the scampi sounds good...
What?
No.  He smokes.
Yes.  You know all the shrinks on Donahue say that all those love songs about some enchanted evening are just a cruel hoax that feeds people's fantasies.
So, what's your point?
I don't know, Kate.
Yeah.  I guess you're right.  I really like the wallpaper we picked out for the den.
I know.  You're right.
I think he's having an affair.
Look, I know you think this is irresponsible of me, but think how much more irresponsible it would be to marry the wrong person. 
My God, you have...
You're just going to fly to Italy and start combing the streets?
You're coming with me?
The book said they have boats that are like taxis...  Vaporettos.  What's the name of the place we're staying again?
What?
The guy at the desk said he only left about a half hour ago, right?
Only what?
The book said they have a lot of rail strikes in Italy.
You know, no offense or anything Kate, but I think I'm starting to see Larry's side of the story.
'Course he does.
Her brother.
And then... we rent a truck, or a car, either one, and we set up a loudspeaker, and we drive through the surrounding areas, and we page him.
Don't be silly.  How's a psychiatrist gonna find him?
Packing.
So you're just quitting?  Just like that?
I know, but...
Yes.  He is.
So.  I guess I've got a wedding to go to.
A pig!  A pig!  She's saying he's a pig.
That's exactly what you are.
No, why?
You used to love it when I called you doll.
He missed me.
Good strategy.
Mania.
I'd get over there, Terry. I'll take the little lady home.
When I was a mere spit of a lad on Ferry Street in Dublin the nuns used to say to me, "Nolan, don't be swallowin' ye words like fishballs. When you got something to say-  -Talk with your mouth wide open," so if I'm loud don't blame me- it's the fault of the nuns!
I know what's eatin' you, kid. But I got two thousand dues-payin' members in my local- that's seventy-two thousand a year legitimate and when each one of 'em puts in a couple of bucks a day to make sure they work steady- well, you figure it out. And that's just for openers. We got the fattest piers in the fattest harbor in the world. Everything that moves in and out- we take our cut.
Gimme.
This is for you to figure out. You can have it your way or you can have it his way.  But you can't have it both ways.  Am I right, Sonny?
That was the idea.
In a minute.
Thicker than water.
They feel you've been sort of left out of things, Terry. They think it's time you had a few little things going for you on the docks.
Maybe.
And for all that dough I don't do nothin'?
I don't know- I don't know! I tell you I ain't made up my mind yet. That's what I wanted to talk to you about.
I could have been better!
Make up your mind, kid, I beg you, before we get to four thirty-seven River... .
Okay- I'll tell him I couldn't bring you in. Ten to one they won't believe it, but- go ahead, blow. Jump out, quick, and keep going... and God help you from here on in.
Edie, I do what I can. I'm in the church when you need me.
I only live up there and across the roof.
Listen, Edie, am I going to see you again?
I don't know.
I wouldn't have thought you'd be so interested -in pigeons.
Even pigeons aren't peaceful.
I don't know.
Hit me again, Mac.
Naw, in the ring, a dive is-
Describing you. A square from out there. I mean you're nowhere.  Miss Four Corners.
Well, nobody, I guess. But that Father Barry, I didn't like the way he kept lookin' at me.
You've been off in daisyland, honey. Everybody's got a racket.
All right, all right.. I shouldn't 've asked you.
I don't want it. But why don't you stay and finish your drink.
Why worry about me? You're the one who says only look out for yourself.
I'm tryin' to keep you from being hurt- What more do you want?
I- I brought this for you, Terry. It was Joey's.  Yours is coming out at the elbows.
You?
Lucky Pop isn't home, he'd kill you.
I never mentioned the word before. In his agony he grips a glass standing on the night table.
It's just a scratch. You won't die. She turns away from him.
Well, it's over.
Are you sure they're your friends?
Terry...?
He wasn't Abyssinian, Pop, Assyrian... .
He wanted to see me again.
I don't want to hear it in there.
Tell it to me in there and my lips are sealed. But if I dig it out myself I can use it where it'll do the most good.
You got eyes. I'm right in front of you.
What do you want from me, Father.
Mind your own business, Father.
Those blood suckers. How I'd love to fix those babies but-
If I stick my neck out, and they chopped it off, would that be the end of it? Or are you ready to go all the way?
You know what you're askin'? You're askin'-
Well, it'll be worth it if we can tell the waterfront story the way the people have a right to hear it. Don't you think?
If I licked him I would have had the title shot instead of him- boy, I was ready that night.
Looping right! I never swung wild. I was strictly a short puncher- hooks- over 'n under-  - whop-whop!
Oh me and my chum are just rolling in the stuff. We only work down here for a hobby, J.P. 
Raise a hand to me and... .
You'd be off the pier for good.
I told you lay off.
Doyle.  Joey Doyle's... .?  ... .You're his... .
Yeah, yeah, I was awake anyway so I figured-  They got it made. Eat all they want- fly around like crazy- sleep side by side- and raise gobs of squabs.
Yeah, once they're mated they stay together all their lives until one of 'em dies.
No.
Take it easy now, Terry.
He followed my birds into their coop. Here, you want him?
So-so, Johnny.
Well, no, Johnny, I just thought I should've been told if-
Naw, thanks, Johnny, I don't want it, I-
How'd you get that.
I was only talkin' to her.
Go on, beat it!
Definitely! Nolan, my boy, you're a walkin' distillery.
You wouldn't understand.  Seeing a cemetery on a night like this can stir in the mind the best ideas for a good horror story.
Where?
I don't know.  I just don't know. But don't give up. We're not finished yet.
I'm afraid I'll faint.
Maybe so.
As I said, a worshipper of snakes, and of smoke, and flames.
It would seem so, Master
Ahh, she will be yours.
There is yet time.  Don't you want your own pleasure?
For what!?!
Yes, Master.
Ahh, good.  Then I will see them.  Dismiss the rest.
Aannnnaahhnn.
Emil the Amazing.  The bastard fired me and hired another girl, a redhead. I'm working on a new business card, pass out to the cafes.  How's this sound--
From Glades to the turnpike.  Then I left with Glenn.
Really.  Hm.
Any idea where I could find Buddy?  Or Glenn?
Who are you?
Thank you.
Oh.  Uh-huh.
Why you want to do that, to a frien'?
She's coming with us.
We were talking one time, drinking rum.  I may've mentioned Adele, how she worked for a magician.  Chino got interested.  He's like, Yeah?  How does he saw the woman in half?  He wanted to meet her.  Or get a look at her if she ever came to visit.
Her phone's probably tapped.
Shit.
In here with my suntan lotion and beach towel.  That's her place.
Sure looks that way.
I been thinkin', if I was Glenn, I was up there to take down the Ripper, where would I go?
I think Glenn opened his big mouth and now we got us another partner.
Two hours.
Forty-five minutes.
Let fate decide?  What're you, the fuckin' Dali Lama now?
I don't know.
I get that feeling, yeah.
I'm not leaving you alone with these assholes.
They sure do.
Shit.
Yes, but I want to hear you tell it. Starting with when you tried to grab the wheel -- where was this?
It was an unusual experience.
Where are you?  I been trying to reach you.
What-- we already talked to her.  That's a dead end.
What?  Is that what you're calling me about?
Yeah, sure, Karen.  You bring in Chirino, you can be on the task force.
You're gonna use a ram?
Call and tell you.
You wouldn't shoot me, would you?
Excuse me, Adele?
You told me I can come 'cause I caught you digging the fuckin' tunnel, saw you and Lulu coming out of the bushes, thought maybe you two were making out.
I appreciate the offer.  And it's tempting.
Guy named Maurice Miller, also known as Snoopy, a former prizefighter.
Wait, I know him --okay?
There a problem, Foley?
Thirty-two outta what, twenty?
Warm?  Man, it's ninety-five degrees in here, sometimes a hundred -- the way Emanuel always kep' it so his boys'd sweat, get lean and mean like Tommy Hearns.  No, I ain't talking any business in here.  To me this is holy ground, man.  You understand?  I got to be someplace anyway.  Y'all want to talk, come to the fights tomorrow night, we'll sit down and look at it good. The State Theater.
Your homie, Glenn.  Only thing, he went to the men's about a while ago and never came back.
Break and enter, shit.  Take it and git, how it's done.  Don't waste any time.  That's how you do it.
Not until recently.
A little.
I'm a federal marshal and you're under arrest, both of you guys.
I believe it.  You've ruined a nine- hundred-dollar suit my dad gave me.
Must be quite a pal, risk his own ass like this.
Buddy.  That's his given name?
Jack Foley.  You've probably heard of me.
Of course I am.
Nothing.
Uh-huh.  Well, but if --
Yes.
I'm just worried maybe I'm not old enough for you.
Really.  He has a cop's face.
Sure.  I'll just leave 'em with the S.W.A.T. guy answers the door.
You won't do that.
I can just picture that, a cute girl like you following slip-and-fall and whiplash cheaters.
You believe that?
To warn her about Chino.
I don't think we should get into that.
I don't know about that.  You can't do three falls and think you have much of a brain.
Pretend I'm somebody else.
Ever seen an uncut diamond, Studs? They look like plain old rocks.
I see better with them on.
You're in civilization now, man, ease up.
I don't know...
Why?  Just because you left us standing on the side of the road?
Really?  Well, I uhhh...
Twenty-two months, three days, two hours.  Why?
Hey, Jack?  Bullshit.  I didn't make my first million until I was forty- two.  Forty-two.  You really <u>want</u> to change, it's never too late.
How, Dick?  The way <u>you</u> earned it?  By marrying some rich broad owns the company, selling it off a piece at a time, then divorcing her?  What is this Knute Rockne, pull yourself up by the bootstraps bullshit?  Back in prison, guy like you, place like that, you were ice cream for freaks.  You were a goddamn dumpling.  Maurice and a dozen other guys coulda bled you till you had nothing.  Till you <u>were</u> nothing.  I saved your ass.  So you'll pardon me if I don't wanna sit on a fuckin stool all day saying "sign in here please" or "hey, pal, you can't park there."  Okay, Dick?  I can't do it.
Maurice Miller, couple of his friends.
Siddown, Dick.  They're trying to open the safe, not your maid.
I'm not angry, Richard.  In fact, I'm completely relaxed.  Thing is, I can't tell if it's the fish that're cooling me out or all those uncut diamonds on the bottom of the tank there.
Five point two.
I'm not leaving Midge.
I prefer to call it an exodus from an undesirable place.
That time?
Ten, you count the prison hospital in Ohio I walked away from.
Apparently, yeah.  I was supposed to leave last night with the lady marshal, but for some reason she wanted to wait.
Listen, these guys, they're gonna be out here any minute looking for me. They're fucking animals.
Really?
Studs.  Hey, son, you must be one a them psychic friends.  I was just thinkin' about you.
Some<u>one</u>?  Gimme a hint.
You just ask me how we gonna do it. That's what I'm here for, tell you how.  We the experts.
What-- when?
I <i>was</i>...
You wanted to tussle, we tussled.
He said he stayed with Maurice.
Which one is that?  The ATF guy?
Huh.
He's pretty laid back, confident.
I want to bust his ass, put him in shackles.
Foley <i>kid</i>napped me.
So?
He doesn't seem to hold a grudge.  What <i>I</i> want to know is why, they got such a big score up north, did Foley hang around Miami for so long?  Any thoughts on that one?
It's possible.  Why?
He knew what he was doing.  Nobody forced him to rob banks.
I don't have any idea.
No.  Course not.
I knew it, soon as I saw they were offering a reward.
I spoke to her.  The guy told her he missed his little girl and she felt sorry for him.
So the woman's married.  She goes to bed with this prison escapee because he misses his little girl and then tells the world about it.  But you don't reveal her name, you protect her.  It sounds like you're saying it's okay as long as her husband doesn't find out about it.  Like the guy who cheats on his wife, saying what she doesn't know won't hurt her.
Well, I need that...
Yeah.  Sure.  It's all settled.
Forget about her.  Tell me where the money's at.
Jack Foley, famous bank robber.
Ten gees.
Ooo, she's thinking of her date!  Come on, you've been dating a pilot.  We want to know what we can expect.
But...they called you Strange?  Because of Red Grange?  I don't get it.  Was Red Grange strange?
If you're patching up bullet holes right here on the runway, maybe we should skip the housekeeping and get right to the planes.
Sir, I --
I wasn't gonna apologize, Sir.  I was just gonna say it was worth it to feel like a real pilot again, even if it was only for five seconds.
Where's that lizard?
You guys know her?!  I gotta have an intro!  Man, I'd like to --
A m-missionary?
You guys are new?
Upset?  Why should I be upset?
You don't wanna put beer over mai-tai.
I was grieving too.
Tighter 'n a bulls ass in fly season. Don't hit the barn.
I'm out of fuel!
Danny, what the hell are you trying to do out there?
No.  You're trying to beat me.
Bullshit.  We've played with each other, pushed each other.  This is different. Like you want to prove that you're better than me.  Who's that for -- Evelyn?
What's between you and her is between you and her.  But here's what's between you and me.  Everybody has a hero, Danny. And you're mine.
We'll get separated over the target, but you and I will rendezvous for the run to China.  I'm on your wing.
You were more like brothers.
He told me he didn't want to leave me with regret.  Now that's all I have.
We won't have the fuel to get back to the carriers; they'll turn and run back to Hawaii the minute we're airborne.
I have a phrase I want you all to memorize:  "Lushu hoo megwa fugi."  It means "I am an American."  In Chinese.
How could it be irresponsible, Sir, if you were the first man in the world to do it?
Thank you, Sir.
Top secret means you help me pick the other pilots, train, and go -- without knowing where you're going until it's too late.
Dorie Miller, 'Mam.
Respect.
You too, 'Mam.
The only reason it's hard to say is that I keep thinking I don't have the right to say it.  But I've got to because it's true.  I love you.  That must surprise you.
Why were you sitting here, instead of...
I'm just...so amazed, so glad to know that you're okay.  You are okay, aren't you?
And if we fail, and lose our carriers, we destroy our ability to fight them at all.  As soon as the second wave returns, we will withdraw.
Have the planes made it to China?
The struts are loose, the hydraulics are leaking, and the electrical system's shorting out in the cockpit.
The Council knows I have opposed fighting the Americans.  No matter how great our resolve, they have resources beyond ours. If we must go to war, there is only one way -- deal them a blow from which it will take them years to recover.  In that time we can conquer all of the Pacific, and they will have no choice but to ask for peace.
That never changes.  You know, when you and Grandma are gone, the family's gone. I never see the cousins anymore.
I hope so. At least I got to see you and Grandma.  Has it ever worked before?
Come on Mom. Give him a break. He's missing the reunion because of you. You know he wants to go.
Why are you so nervous? What is the matter with you today?
We did for a long time. We just got married too young, and ended up blaming each other for missing out on things.
Well, besides Charlie, of course.
I can't. It's all too much.
Yeah. You're so lucky. He really loves you, too. He's always telling Walter how wonderful you are.
Aren't we a little old for that?
Why do guys do such stupid things?
Jesus, Peggy. Take it easy. I'm not used to that stuff. You always did the bills. Blame the damn post office.
I know. Put Scott through college.
Why wait?
They'll learn to live with it.
Thanks.
Is this slow enough for you?
I'm fine Peggy Sue. And how are you? Are we talking on the phone? Are we pen pals?
Your eyes look like silver pools of moonlight.  And the tide rushes in.
You know I do.  I even wrote you into my will.
What?! You mean sex?! Intercourse?  You want to have intercourse! Last weekend you said... What time is it?
But you're the one who wanted to wait till we got married. And you were right. We should wait.
I have to talk to you..
Let's go down to the basement.
That won't make any difference. We just can't live together. And you had the nerve to drive up with that bimbo Janet.
I'm trying to save you years of frustration... waiting for a big break... no. Waiting for that big disappointment so you could blame it all on me.
I wanted to talk to you, and I have one last thing to take care of at school. Then I'm going to...  Good dog, Rusty. Good dog.
You're kidding. You wrote a song? Is it about a guilty girl and a trusting guy... she wants to hurt him, and he wonders why?
It means I care about you and what happens to you.
You're going to listen to me.
What?
Don't try to charm me, Charlie Bodell.
Okay.
He won't tell me, but I've got my suspicions. And I don't want any of that. Don't keep her out late.
I thought chicks like you traveled in packs.
Yeah. I'm surprised. It's really old...  Travels well though.  You know, the world looks a lot better from up here.
Utah? I thought you'd be going to New York or Paris. What's in Utah?
Grounded? Ha! The story of my life. I don't wanna go to my room. I wanna import Japanese cars. I wanna go to Liverpool and discover the Beatles.
Evelyn, put her to bed.
That would be impossible.
It's not Charlie. It's me.
This morning was good.
Don't worry, it's just a seasonal slump.
How do you feel?
Why don't you go lie down for a while.
What about?
I'm sorry, Mom. I'll call Grandma back and apologize.
For what?
I went for a drive. Up in the hills.
Look at Kenny Rossi. Isn't he dreamy? I wish he'd break up with Arlene. She thinks she's so great.
I'm not doing any tutoring this year. I'm too busy.
I'm writing a book on kite construction. What did you want to talk about?
Are you doing some kind of science project?
What's that?
I	know what a burrito is.
I don't know.
I told you, I've already lived my life. I don't know how or why I'm here, but you have to help me get back. I want to get back to my real life!
I'm just not the type. Besides, I want to get out of here.
Give me some credit, will you?
When do we start?
High tech. I like the sound of that.
Everything. This is perfect. The subconscious mind remembers all. You can give me more information on microchips and then pinpoint what happened at the reunion. Maybe that'll give us a clue on how to get you back.
No offense, but you're pretty out of it now.
Peggy Sue Kelcher.  Or, Peggy Bodell.  I'm not sure.
Ah..... they're very tiny... they look like a fingernail made out of an erector set...
I think it has something to do with your birthday. You were rambling. I didn't understand the rest.
Goodbye? Where're you going? What about our partnership? I'm making real progress with the microchip.
Okay. Why don't we do something visionary. Change your destiny, Peggy Sue. Change your destiny and marry me.
Wait! I'll go with you!
Pretty much so.
I don't know what you expected to find, Matthews. There's nothing wrong with the antigens, nothing to indicate an unusual death...
Yes... why?
He's probably going up to the Pet Sematary. Kids've been going out there on Halloween night for years.
"Out." Well that's great, Geoff.  Look, I've been letting you get away with a lot these past few weeks, but I'm not going to stand for crap like this. I don't care if it's Halloween... it's a school night, and if you do this again...
Hey, I'm so sorry I'm not the stud that you are.
Zowie.
He pissed me off.
Look, if there was even one chance in a million it'd work, wouldn't you want to try?
I don't know but I'm not taking any chances...
Go later...
You'll have to get right on it, Andy, we're up against the statute of limitations.
Yes, Bob, I do.  Excuse me? Am I being fired?
What's that on your forehead, pal?
Oh, you're right, Beckett, you don't have an attitude problem.
You're not going to like this. Please try to smile...
I said, "Everyone's going to die, Jimmy. But Drew's not going to die of AIDS. There's a cure around the corner, and he plans to be around to take advantage of it."
I said, skip it, Michael. It's my treatment.
Maybe you should think about it.
Maybe you should think about it.
No sweat, buddy.
Of course.
Honesty is always best.
Don't do this, Andy.
Little baby girl.
How many lawyers did you go to, before you called me?
We?
They sabotaged me.
Look. I know I have a case. If you don't want to take it for personal reasons...
Beckett? I'm sorry about... what's happened to you. It's a fucking kick in the head.
Any settlement agreement <u>must</u> include, and this is critical, a letter of exoneration, making clear my termination had nothing to do with the quality of my work.
What kind of person is that?
It's possible I was infected with the HIV virus at that time, but I wasn't diagnosed until several years later.
I'm an excellent lawyer.
What?
I'd heard of <u>something</u>. The gay plague, gay cancer, but... we didn't know how you could get it, or that it could kill you.
That is <u>not</u> correct. I never lied about it.
You could have infected him, isn't that right?
Absolutely.
Hold on, Mom.  There's no way my client will go along with that.
Yes.
Well... One time, Mr. Wheeler's secretary, Lydia, told me Mr. Wheeler had a problem with my earrings.
Yeah, but Doc, isn't it true they keep finding out new things about this disease? So you tell me, today, there's no danger, and I go home, and I hold my baby, and six months from now I hear on the news: "whoops! We were wrong.' You <u>can</u> carry it on your clothes, your skin, and now I've got to worry about my kid. What are you doing?
Uh.... No. Not really.
We won.
Get a life.
Duh...
That's perfectly clear.
Is there some kind of expression I've picked up from Beckett?! Some kind of fairy attitude I've unconsciously adopted?! Am I walking different?! Some kind of vocal thing?! Have I picked up some kind of homo <u>vibe</u>?!
Very funny. I had a box of Pampers under my arm for Chrissake!
Great, Lisa. Thank you.
Of course you have a case! Now, I want you to go with my assistant, Iris, and fill out some forms. She'll tell you about our fee arrangement.  Mrs. Finley? Any back pain since the accident? Dizziness? Nightmares?
So during those long voyages, months at a time, out to sea, no women in sight, a hundred, hardworking, robust, young men, in the prime of their life, at the peak of their natural appetites, desires, their god- given, hormonal <u>instincts</u>... Anything going on?
How did you do that?
Yes, we did.
... keep them from that area, on grounds of relevancy.  What, Bob?
It's a fucking staircase! Go over it! GO OVER IT!
Yeah, yeah -- we're all fuckin' amazed. Anyone not ready for this?
Not sure where to go. I was just runnin' away when this whole thing started.  Where you goin'?
It was just somebody else. From the crash. He was just....
Well, is someone coming for us? Or are we all just gonna die of exposure or dehydration or sunstroke or maybe even something worse?  Hey, you don't have to worry about scaring me.
The ones tellin' me to go for the sweet spot -- just to the left of the spine, fourth lumbar down. The abdominal aorta. What a gusher. Had a cup on his belt, so I used it to catch a little run-off. Metallic taste to it, human blood. Coppery. But if you cut it with peppermint schnapps, that goes away. Course, that's more for winter. Summertime, I take mine straight.
Saw something I didn't like.
Truthfully? I wouldn't know how.
You're fuckin' with me. I know you are.
No, you see, I <u>promised</u> them...I have to...I have to go and....
But they...they could still be....
Carolyn Fry. I'd shake hands, but...
Big Evil?
Be my choice. Already escaped once from the max-slam facility on --
Little swamp-flu from the Conga system. Never shook it with all this cryo-sleep.
Thought you found his restraints over there. Toward sunset.
Promise me. Swear to me you won't --
Fuck. Guess I'm more glad to be here than I thought.
Like what?
Thought you didn't believe his story.
Hey. Bein' ballsy with your life now doesn't change what came before -- it's just stupid.
You said it, not me. Let's just not let one bad call lead to another.
Nothing we can't repair -- so long as the electrical adapts.
So what happened? Where are they, then?
We're not sure <u>when</u> it happens, so let's not --
He also figured out how to kill the pilot, Fry.
May've noticed chains don't work on this guy. Only way we're truly safe is if he believes he's goin' free. But if he <u>stops</u> believin' --
'Sokay, 'sokay. I killed it.
Oh, don't use her like that, for a smoke screen.
We're just burnin' light here.
I don't get it, Johns. What is so goddamn valuable in your life that you're worried about losing? Huh? Is there anything at all? Besides your next hype?  Got no right to be so scared. Neither one of us.
How much you weigh right now, Fry? Huh?
Ask if anyone has anything in cargo! Anything to drink!
You hear me? Captain's dead. Owens too.
Company's not here, is it?
"Some prophet guy." And a city man. But he had to travel to the desert -- where there was quiet -- to hear the words of God.
Riddick?
What?
I would rather we all stay--
Which half?
The child heard you before any of us could even....
Not if I'm the one.
Kept calling it "murder" when I did it.
What, you 'spect <u>me</u> to do it?
Blow-dart hunting stick from Papua New Guinea. Very <u>very</u> rare, since the tribe's extinct.
It wasn't difficult. Only an apostate or a lunatic would flee to the Forbidden Zone.  I see you brought along the female of your species.  I didn't realize a man could be monogamous.
We've never meant to be treasonable, sir.  But up there, in the face of that Cliff, is a vast cave -- and in that cave a fabulous treasure of fossils and artifacts.
Sorry, Taylor. The terrain around that lake is poisonous. There is no fresh water, no vegetation. Nothing.
Right now, if you like.
Taylor, you're not in command here. Put down that gun.
No. You saved me from this fanatic. Maybe I can pay you back.
Good luck then.
No.
No creature can survive in that part of the Forbidden Zone. I've been there. I've seen it.
Zira, listen to me. We've got a fine future ahead of us. Marriage. Stimulating careers. I'm up for a raise --
Yo!
Yo!
But how long is a day?
Any sign of dangerous ionization?
You're more than three hundred light years from your precious planet. Your loved ones have been dead and forgotten for twenty centuries. Even if you could get back, they'd think you were something that fell out of a tree.
Let's find them all.
Him.
What do you mean, made it? I'm an animal psychologist, that's all. We don't have any authority.
Learned Judges: My case is simple. It is based on our first Article of Faith: that the Almighty created the ape in his own image; that He gave him a soul and a mind; that He set him apart from the beasts of the jungle, and made him the lord of the planet.
Proceed. But don't turn this hearing into a farce.
Be it so ordered. The Tribunal will examine all the evidence presented here and in due time render a verdict on the proposed indictment and on the disposition of the deviate in question.  This hearing is adjourned.
Good morning, Julius. How's our patient today?
What signal?
Forget it. Abandon ship.
We're some three hundred and twenty light years from Earth. On an unnamed planet in orbit around a star in the constellation of Orion.  That could be Bellatrix.
Prove it. If we can't get back, it's still just a theory.
So you can talk.  I'm Dr. Zira's nephew. This abduction was her idea. You're not really going to the zoo. That's just our cover story in case we're stopped.  Although I do feel that if it ever came down to a question of whether something like you should be public or private property --
Keep moving. We can't turn back now.
A man, Dr. Maximus.
At the very least, this man has the right to know whether there's a charge against him.
This hearing is absurd! Let me tell my story...
Then why is he called the accused Your Honors must think him guilty of something.
Stop right there. Bring me that paper.
Oh, your case was preordained. In a way, you performed a service for the State ...  Because your hearing made it possible for us to expose Zira and Cornelius.  And now the Tribunal has placed you in my custody for...final disposition. Do you know what that means?
Then you admit --
Don't be a fool. You're outnumbered and outgunned.
All right, let's see if you're willing to put that statement to a test.
When were the Sacred Scrolls written?
Very well. If Zira and Cornelius can prove that those scrolls don't tell the whole truth of your history; if they can show you definite evidence of another culture from an unrecorded past -- will you exonerate them?
Cease fire! Withdraw!
He might have been wiped out by a plague. Natural catastrophe. Like a fiery storm of meteors. From the looks of this part of your planet, I'd say that was a fair bet.
Listen, listen -- I can speak --
A hearing.
No, I swear -- I never saw this man before.
Taylor -- just keep quiet and we may get away with this. Remember that men all look alike to most apes.
You're going back to the Forbidden Zone?
Maybe not.
You threw us together, remember? And you guessed right. Men, like apes, get despondent without a mate.
All right, but....  ...you're so damned ugly!
Of course. He saw you moving yours.
Yes, Sir.
This is his assertion.
Where?
How the hell did he get away?
Fuck that redneck noise, dude. All dem chicks be rappin' how dey losin' der' ho's and how dey ain't got no bread for beer. Fuck dat honky shit. Got to get me some motown jams, dig it?
What?
Hey take it easy man. They're scared.
Yeah. How 'bout you?
Barnes believes in what he's doing.
Knock it off! We got two men need attention here. Police up your extra ammo and frags, don't leave nothing for the dinks. Hoyt, Junior, carry Gardner.
You know what I'm talking about!
...and you know how many times he done been shot?  Seven times!  Seven.
That's what he is... Baaaa!

How do you do?
I see.
You don't sound as if you liked him very much.
They know you here--know your name.
You don't know who he is?
That wasn't why I called you.  Why did I hope--when I hadn't any right to hope?
How bad is the other thing?  The secret?
But that's what I'm doing.  Couldn't they think of that?
I told you my father died in jail. He stole a fortune.  Most of it pretty dirty money.  I don't care to have that known.
If it was an accident, you could have told the truth.
That man that was following us last night--he didn't come back this morning.  I'm beginning to wonder about him, too.  Was he really following me--or you?
And that nasty man that followed us last night.  You didn't kill him.
Every day of your life you'll want me.  You'll never get over it. Every time you see your face in the mirror--
I was born in New York City. I grew up. And here I am.
It is?
You were a galahad, compared to some cops I've known.
Is it a crime?
I don't want to talk.
What does he see?
Very ridiculous.
Jeff.  Shall we go now, Jeff, and get it over with?
Looking for peanuts, I suppose.
To do what?
What will they do to you?
I know that.
There's an empty taxi across the street.  If you're so anxious, take it.  He'll know the way to the police headquarters.
Morning. Any calls?
Who's Goble?
I'm not interested in blind dates.
You asked for it.
You guessed it. The card's phony. I got plenty of 'em. Different names, different jobs. I work out of San Francisco. Go anywhere, do anything. All it takes is the folding.
For two hundred?
You mentioned information.
Martini.
What's a buzzer?
The new ones are fine. The last set I had gave me all kinds of trouble.
Delightfully. Every time Miss Mayfield says something, I know less than I did before.  Well, I may as well knock off for tonight.  Good night, Miss Mayfield. Do let me thank you for your cooperation.
Could we discuss that some other time?
I buy my shirts by the dozen. Fortunately.
What?
The liquors lovely. The rest of the party you can have.
I don't think you locked your door.
Sardonic, if you will my dear. Bust nasty. You lied about the gun.
I'm sorry, Inspector, I don't know much about..
Floater?
Drunk-rolling job.  They hit him too hard.
Let me know when you've identified him
I'm an Irishman, sir.  An Irishman is always logical.
I've got a year.  Or a second. I'm not sure which.
I understand.  Pity to mess up a nice clean boat.
Would you?
How important would it have to be? It's only murder, Inspector.
Go live in a tent.
Talk English.  How do I know you're you?
Correct, Inspector. A woman's gun. U.S. 125 caliber ammunition in it. It was on a table in there.
So the wound and the shell give you the same answer.
I've always looked forward to it. All right, let's get him out of here and tidy up.
Somebody did it twice last night-- in the dark.
I think so.
Do I know who lives down there?
Do I know that she's out of the room?  Likely to be out of it for some time?
So?
If she didn't--if luck was against him--he wipes the gun off, reaches the wall up there--drops it on the chaise.
Not quiet yet.
Anybody could commit suicide, if he felt low enough. I've felt it myself.
You didn't play it for laughs last night.
I'm interested in who handled it.
She might.
How do you do, sir.
Nobody's covering her, I detached the officer assigned to that duty.
We lifted seven fairly good prints from Miss Mayfield's toilet articles.  Washington ought to teletype us within a few hours.
Yes, sir.
Identification on possible, Sir. Not conclusive.
You'd go to jail. For a long term.
She is much younger than I am. That's something I'm going to have to get used to. Isn't it, Larry? They'll all be much younger than I am. Here.  Tear them up.
Oh, forget it. Clark Brandon's throwing a party up in his penthouse this evening. Take me?
A girl you meet on the train. Excuse my bringing it up again.  Be back in an hour. Right?
What a shame.
Well, I am a great admirer of your work.  I read your books on Chartism when I was still at school.  I'm a journalist, not a historian.  There are questions of method, and approach.  I wondered--
Please do.  I was beginning to wonder who this Mr. Penfield was.
To James.  I remember what it was I was going to say.  We were talking about forgetfulness.  The Czech writer Kundera has one of his characters say that the struggle of man against tyranny is the struggle of memory against forgetting.
If we leave the remembering to historians then the struggle is already lost.  Everyone must have a memory, everyone needs to be a historian.  In this country, for example, we're in danger of losing hard-won freedoms by dozing off in a perpetual present.
I will, thanks.
Didn't Evelyn Waugh say that the country under Atlee seemed to be under enemy occupation?
Sit on that log, dear.
Yes, please.
Thank you.
Thank you.
No, it's all right.  I can get a cab.  Night night.
I quite liked it.  I wasn't as enthusiastic as everyone else.
I think it went on rather too long.
And the shape of it all.  It was sort of...shapeless.
How nice.
Who?
I have to be up early. 
Two or three years ago I would have stayed.  And fucked you.
I might.
Yes.  Might.  Remember, you're here to talk to my mother.
Let me see.
Mmm...
You're so gross.
Will it be fun?
Yes, finally.
Are you up to something?
My God.  You even cooked up that Norfolk trip.
You're a piece of shit
I'm not here.
Dad.
Well, she doesn't complain much. You know what she's like.  She keeps asking when you're coming...
No, thanks Dad.
U-huh.
Voila!
Promise?
I know that part.  Tell me something I can use, here.
Yeah, right, vision is highly over- rated.
So, who... uh, who packed my chute?
You do it... you first!
SHIT!!
Have you seen a little dog?  Kind of a cockapoo lookin' thing.  About this big.
Yes, sir.
Zero distortion, sir.
The correct term is babes, sir.  Uh, this type of undercover operation is entirely dependent on picking up the idiom of the speech.  Otherwise penetration is not possible, sir. Of the social infrastructure, I mean.
Yeah, sure.  Why not?  You two screw-ups deserve each other. That's why I put you together in the first place.  Christ Pappas, you're as bad as he is... talk about the blind leading the blind--
What that?
The fucking punks are surfers.
Why can't I just walk around with this thing under my arm and act stoned?  Ask a few questions.
Remember, all bank robbers are losers, but not all losers are bank robbers.
Cole and Munoz are going in the back door.  Babbit is backing me.  So I want you at the side window by the hedge.  You're strictly backup, got it?
Nice tattoo, Dietz.
Sure.  No problem.  I'll just call up and tell him his favorite agent saw this one surfer moon another surfer yesterday and it looked real suspicious.  Shit, he'll probably call out the National Guard.
Kid, get outta the way!!
Well, I'm just gonna go back out there till I catch on to it or break my neck.
He rents it for the summer.  Bodhi always gets some slick place and throws it open to every surf burnout around.  Most a these guys can't keep a job.  When the swell comes, they're gone, they have to ride.
Catch of the day.
What?
I... I don't know.  I can't describe what I'm feeling.
Betadyne doesn't hurt.
Never saw him, was your basic hit and run.
Those cabinet members are very important to our scope of operations in this part of the world. They're about to get squeezed. We can't let that happen. I needed someone who could get the job done, quick and quiet... no screw-ups. I needed the best. The best. So, I pulled a few strings at the State Department... and here we are.
You never were all that smart... let's go!!!
They're getting better equipped every day.
Jesus... this is inhuman.  Uh... I wasn't told of any operations in this area. They shouldn't have been here.
We take her and she'll give away our position, every chance she gets. No prisoners, Dillon.
Expendable assets, Dillon. Seems Langley is never around when you need them.
No more games.
Now what, Dutch. You going to send your mystery guest an invitation?
You know you can't win this one.
Can't say, Major... been squirrely all mornin'... fuckin' weird... sometimes I think that nose of his is too good... smells things that ain't there.
The best friend I ever had.
It's been a long time, General.
That's the problem. Apparently they strayed off course.  We're certain they've been captured by the guerrillas.
Same business, guerrillas hauling two guys from the chopper... followed by men with American equipment...
I think it's Hawkins.
He knows our defenses.
No wonder.  For starts, you should know that hot pants are <u>horrid</u>, even when you do have the legs to carry them off.  What are your plans while you're in town?
Philip!  We'll need shoes!
He's not really my uncle.
I don't think so.  You should know we're going to fight you with every resource we have.
I see.  Well.  Maybe that means you'd have lunch with me sometime then.
I'd like to find out.  You don't know anything about me either. That's why people have lunch.
You what?
What?
To get me in a mood to sell -- double what I paid.  But your company doesn't have enough capital right now to buy anything.
<u>Expected</u>... offer.
Yes.
How?
You're very right.  I think the best thing we could all do is go home.
Uh, no.  How do I get to Beverly Hills?
Yes.
Sit... and spin.
No.
You're not from L.A., huh?
What motel you staying at?
Do you plan everything?
They should be.  They're both good at it.
Oooh, thank god.
Yeah.  Too good.  I forgot where I was.
... dollars?
C'mon, I might buy a company some day.
I fucked the debate team in high school.  Tsk.  I had a grampa. He liked ties on Sundays.  You mind if I take a swim in your bathtub before I hit it?
No, I don't "got it".  Even the farmboys back in Georgia come to the door when they're taking you on a date.
Upset.  No.  I never get upset about business.
Television?
Not much to tell.  I went to public school.  Went to university on scholarship.  Went to work for an investment firm. In eight years I owned it.  My father was chairman of the board of the third company I ever went after.  I swallowed that company and shit out the pieces. One of the pieces was him.
I really doubt anyone here frequents Hollywood Boulevard.
I'm sure that's true for some of them.
Vivian...
I'll call you a cab.  If you want the clothes, pack them up.
I'll guard them and you with my life.
Where are you taking me!?
Huh?
Did you?
When I was a little girl, my mother locked me in the attic when I was bad, which was pretty often. I'd stare out the window up there and make believe I was a princess trapped in the tower by the wicked queen.  Then suddenly a knight on a white horse with his bright colors flying would ride up. Rescue me from the tower, and then we'd ride off... but never, ever in all the times I had that dream did the knight say, "Come on baby, I'll put you up in a great condo."
Vivian...
Apologize to Elizabeth for me.
Eight o'clock.  Kross is bringing his son.  Very bright kid, watch yourself with him.  Who's this girl you're taking?
We're letting them slide?
I think I broke my hand.  You're fired.
Hi, Viv.  Carlos, you know my roommate, Viv.
I bet.  That was our rent!
That crack is burning a hole in your pocket.  There isn't even milk in the fridge.  The rent's due.  Now come on --
Kit!  Where've you been?
Where do you fit?
Honey, you're not supposed to do that.
Oh, my god, you mean it was good?
Wow, are you in deep shit.  You know he'll break your heart.
Yeah.  Well... I gotta split. Goodbye's make me crazy.
Kit give me nothin'.
Of rent I do not bullshit.
I leave extras, miss.
Of course.  Naturally when Mr. Harris leaves, I won't see you in this hotel again.
Okay.  Thanks, Barney.  You're the best.
I like steak.
Miss Vivian.
Don't worry.  I'll pay for it. What a you charge?  Huh?  Twenty, thirty, fifty bucks, <u>maybe</u>?  Are you a fifty dollar whore?
Then I'm here till I die?
You survived the Fire Swamp. You must be very brave...  ... but nobody withstands The Machine. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           69.
"Are not capable of love" is what you mean.
With pride. What can I do for you?
Hardly complimentary, Your Highness. Why loose your venom on me?
As you wish.
Hear this now: I will come for you.
I will never doubt again.
No. No. We have already succeeded.
It never happened.
I just don't think it's right, killing an innocent girl.
Veer left. Left. Left!
Oh, good, my way. Thank you, Vizzini.  Which way is my way?
But you don't know where he is.
His true love is marrying another tonight, so who else has cause for Ultimate Suffering?  Excuse me --
That's right. When I was your age, television was called books. And this is a special book. It was the book my father used to read to me when I was sick, and I used to read it to your father. And today, I'm gonna read it to you.
I don't be-leeve this.
All right, then. No more interruptions.  ... at noon, she met her subjects again. This time as their Queen.
Many of the thieves will resist. My regular enforcers will be inadequate.
Who won? How did it end?
I swear it will be done.
Yes.
Oh, I know. The people are quite taken with her. It's odd, but when I hired Vizzini to have her murdered on our engagement day, I thought that was clever. But it's going to be so much more moving when I strangle her on our wedding night. Once Guilder is blamed, the nation will be truly outraged. They'll demand we go to war.
I'll beat you both apart. I'll take you both together.
That doesn't leave much time for dilly dallying.
Stop saying that!
Are you a rotten liar.
Your first story was better.  Where's that bellows?  He probably owes you money, huh? Well, I'll ask him.
Sonny, true love is the greatest thing in the world. Except for a nice MLT, a mutton, lettuce and tomato sandwich, where the mutton is nice and lean and the tomato is ripe. They're so perky, I love that. But that's not what he said. He distinctly said "to blave." And, as we all know, "to blave" means "to bluff." So you're probably playing cards, and he cheated
Okay. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           97.
No one of consequence.
Get used to disappointment.
I don't swim. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           15.
You keep using that word -- I do not think it means what you think it means.  My God! He's climbing.
You'd like to think that, wouldn't you?  You've beaten my giant, which means you're exceptionally strong. So, you could have put the poison in your own goblet, trusting on your strength to save you. So I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you. But, you've also bested my Spaniard which means you must have studied. And in studying, you must have learned that man is mortal so you would have put the poison as far from yourself as possible, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me.
I'm not a witch, I'm your wife. But after what you just said, I'm not even sure I want to be that anymore.
Don't say another word, Valerie.
A good hour. Yeah.
He'll pinch my cheek. I hate that.
Roger, do you mind if we talk a little business?
That's genius.  That's genius. Roger, I think I speak for Mr. Bloom and myself when I say that you're the only man in the world who can do justice to SPRINGTIME FOR HITLER.
Congratulations.
What are you saying?
How do you do.  I mean ... Excuse me ... I mean ...
Who are you?  What do you want? Why are you loitering in my hallway? Speak, dummy, speak!  Why don't you speak?
Koff, koff ... ahem, ahem ... harrumph ...
You raised two thousand more than you needed to produce your last play.
Bloom, worlds are turned on such thoughts!
You miserable, cowardly, wretched little caterpillar.  Don't you ever want to become a butterfly?  Don't you want to spread your wings and flap your way to glory?
They certainly do.  They certainly do.  Come, let me take you to lunch.
Well, Max, I don't know, Max.  What do you think, Max?
Coney Island??
Look, I'm just not wearing this arm band.  I don't care how big the deal is.
Mrs. Virginia Resnick.  She also owns 50% of the profits.
Leo, what if this play is a hit?
I'll show you.  Ulla, go to work.
It's gorgeous.  Absolutely gorgeous. You couldn't have picked a better color.  It brings out your eyes. Let's face it, Roger, that dress is you.
To failure!
What is it?
Ahhhhhh.  Leo, Leo, Leo.
We loved it.  We thought it was a masterpiece.  That's why we're here. We want to produce it on Broadway.
No kidding?
Really, I never dreamed ...
Franz, don't you see, Hitler was a man of his time.  This is a man of his time.
All right.  Finish the job.  Let's get outta here.
Of course I need you.  It's dark in there.
Hey, Blum, have a cigar.
Here I come, ready or not.
I can't take my eyes off you.  How can I drive when you drive me mad. Mad.
And after that we'll play the Abduction and cruel rape of Lucretia ... And I'll play Lucretia.
Where are you going vit the light?
I mean in show business.
Hey, man, let's stomp Switzerland!
I'm not the police.
What?
Tell me all about her.
Of which morning?
No one met her?
You didn't spend the whole night with her did you?
How do you know she didn't make a call?
How did she pay you?
And when she left, she never came back.
Suppose I wanted to search the cabins, all twelve... would I need a warrant?
Just for a moment. She might have picked up a hint you'd miss.
No! Just no!  I have one of those breaking points like any other man, believe it or not, and I'm near it. There's just so much pushing I can take and I think...
Must've needed it.
What?
No. Thank you. I'm in... a hurry. I just want to make a change and start...
Of course not. Please.
Five hundred.
But what?  Is there anything so terribly wrong about... making a decision and wanting to hurry? Do you think I've stolen... my car?
You got aspirins? I have something... not aspirins, but  my mother's doctor gave these to me the day of my wedding.  Teddy was furious when he found out I'd taken tranquilizers!
Now. Your sister is missing how long?
How'd you and this detective come to trace her to Fairvale?
Like what?
Lila.
To begin with, where Mary is. Do you?
What do you know about it?
Not that kind...  You men and your egos.
I think she'll contact me if she contacts anybody. Why don't you stay here. When she shows up... or calls... be here.
Sam. He said an hour. Or less.
Sam.
This is Lila Crane, from Phoenix. She's been here for a few days, looking for her sister. There's a private detective helping... and, well, we got a call tonight, from this detective, saying he'd traced Mary...
Neither will I.
I didn't. I got a job, too.  I wonder if that hurt her, my not letting her sacrifice for me?  Some people are so willing to suffer for you that they suffer more if you don't let them.
This is the old highway.
She always tries to be proper.
I know.  Do you think if something happened, it happened there?
Why not?
What do I do with my free afternoon, walk you to the airport?
I've lost my girlish laughter.
This! Meeting you in secret so we can be... secretive! You come down here on business trips and we steal lunch hours and... I wish you wouldn't even come.
I'll lick the stamps.
I'm thinking of it.
I'm late... and you have to put your shoes on.
You have a vacancy?
There's a big diner about ten miles on up... just outside Fairvale.
Fifteen miles. I'll get your bags.
The bathroom.
Thank you, Mr. Bates.
I have?
It's more than a hobby... sometimes... a hobby is supposed to pass the time, not fill it.
Oh, no!  I run the office, tend the cabins and grounds, do little chores for mother... the ones she allows I might be capable of doing.
What are you running away from?
Oh I do... but I say I don't. 
A son is a poor substitute for a lover. 
To a private island, like you?
Yes, and just one time can be enough.  Thank you.
Norman.
I'm very tired. And I'll have a long drive tomorrow. All the way back to Phoenix.
I stepped into a private trap back there -- and I want to go back and... try to pull myself out.  Before it's too late for me, too.
Yes. As I said, I couldn't keep my eyes...
I didn't intend to sleep all night! I just pulled over... have I broken any laws?
Of course not! Am I acting as if... something's wrong?
I'm sorry.
I suppose you want a cabin.
Better sign in first, hasn't we?
Haven't any.
Yes.
Leave me alone!
Go on, go tell her she'll not be appeasing her ugly appetite with my food... or my son! Or do I have to tell her, cause you don't have the guts? Huh, boy? You have the guts, boy?
Left Phoenix under her own steam?
Yes! In the house behind the motel. I pounded and called but she... just ignored me.
You must've seen an illusion, Sam. Now, I know you're not the seeing- illusion type... But no woman was illusion there and I don't believe in ghosts, so there it is!
Did she talk?
I am certainly glad to hear it. I know he'll be pleased.
[Perfectly friendly, my dear.] At last, I have really a secure living for us. We can travel or anything we choose.
Take him to the psychopathic hospital.
Why didn't you notify the police?
Do you have many patients, doctor?
The wound is bleeding!
Yes!
Yes!
Joseph returns from the room where Gis?le is. He has evidently succeeded in calming her. He goes and sits in the chair where Nikolas sat. He rests his head in his hand. He sees the open diary and begins reading it.
I just had a picture of you telling a landlady some day that you didn't have the rent, but Ralph is awful sweet.
I met one last night ... all the money this side of Peoria.
I don't think you could have a real affair. You couldn't care for anyone.
She isn't anybody's friend, and I don't like you living with her. She's a bad influence.
Don't kid yourself -- she means it.
I'm not quarreling, only ...
I'd call it stupid at any time.
Don't take my word for it. Get down there yourself and give a look.
You mean he was colored?
Well, is it my fault if nothing happens?
If this kid was some unknown soda jerker, they wouldn't have pinched him. But he's George Winton and they're playing him up. It's a Roman holiday for every paper hat editor in New York.
Well, anyway, he couldn't have copped that body -- he was in jail.
All right, you said I was fired. Well, I quit! Give the assignment to somebody else. 
So you can give me an argument and tell me I'm wrong. Don't be sil, Kid.
I used to be married to one.
Work that up into a comic strip and syndicate it.
Almost certain.
What do you mean -- haywire? You start out after murderers and come back with three-for-a-dime bootleggers. You start to solve murder mysteries and break up crap games. You're grand! I'm for you! Stupendous!
No, sir, I'm sure it wasn't there.
How's every little thing?
No foolin' -- any suspect?
What does that prove?
I'm after news, as usual. I wonder if it would be all right for me to slip in and look around your factory?
Cry-baby?
They didn't give me a chance. We had a couple of drinks and she was all right then. She seemed happy.
We planned a trip for her. I was going to send her to Bermuda.
Then why are you telling me a crazy lie? ...
Not even if it gives you a clean bill of health?
I suppose this is going to sound absurd. I've only known you twenty-four hours, but I'm in love with you.
No, really -- I'm crazy about you.
Heaven knows. A lot.
She will undoubtedly keep her promise. If you'll grant me the privilege, I'd like to submit this work to the Royal Academy when I get back.
But the composition as a whole -- I've tried to keep a sketchy freedom.
Yes.
He can't hear you.
They didn't have a leg to stand on. There's no case against me. It's a clumsy thing to have happen, but nothing to worry about.
Thanks.
Excuse me???
Where to?
God.  I dunno.  The eternal nothingness. Mia.
Inside every semi-conductor... you have two particles, with opposite charges, separated by an impassable barrier...
A five hundred foot thick steel wall.  But the connection between these two electrons is so --
Is Rose here?
Well, I got to see her.
Sex isn't ugly, sex is one of the most beautiful things in life, the creative power of the universe is behind it.
Bad is bad, Buddy. There ain't no sense to it.
He really did, he ate his little niece. He made pork chops out of her.
Buddy, I am wandering in a wilderness, lost.  I just feel awful. Do you mind if I get in bed with you for a little while?
What'd you do, Rose?
But, Rose, how could such a thing as that happen?
Ha ha ha, that's some idea, a cantaloupe.
You know, that Daddy of yours is the funniest man, the things he says, you never know what's going to come out of his mouth next.
Hmmph. It has a nipple, all right.
I'm thirteen. And I have a natural curiosity. It's only nature, Rose, that's all. Now what's wrong with nature, huh?
Am I hurting you?
But why, if I'm not hurting you?
No. No, I'm all right.  Oh, God, what have I done? I have robbed a cradle and fallen into hell!  I must be crazy, a child like you. Oh, God, oh, Lord. This is awful, this is terrible, I gotta get outta here!
Don't worry, Rose, I won't tell a soul.
Oh, Buddy, you do love me! I knew you did, knew it all the time...
Yeah.
Well, he might be that man who followed me home from the store the other day. But I don't know who he is, Buddy, I really don't.
He did?
Yeah, I'd believe it.
What are you going to do, Rose?
How did the rabbits kill him?
Buddy, sex don't mean a thing to me. It ain't nothin' but a mosquito bite.  I'll tell you a secret. Girls don't want sex, Buddy, girls want love.
Oh, Waski, you don't even know what we're talking about.
I don't know. But you better watch him like a hawk, if he comes back again.
Well, I don't know.  No, I don't know, Daddy, I think the rain has obscured it.
Daddy, what's the matter?
In the kitchen drinking all the ice water in Glenville. She walked out here, she didn't go by the hotel.
I do wish you'd speak to Brother. It's true he's been looking at those horrible little books again.
Now I have a plan about Rose, an educational plan. She's getting better and we don't want any more trouble --  Brother, you ought to hear this.
No.
Shut up, Doll. I'll cut your guts
Good God, the way you live here. This place hasn't been dusted since Mother died. Look at that goddamned refrigerator.
Dave Wilkie of all people was sitting by me on the plane -- her first husband. It's funny you would mention Rose. Did you hear from her?
Yeah, I know, he was up here. It's pitiful like you say. When he lost Rose it ruined the man, it destroyed him totally when he lost Rose.
A wonderful woman, boy.
I'm older than hell, boy. But this Yankee whisky is mighty fine, I'll say that.
Well, well, well. So Miss Rosebud has arrived. Un-hmm. And you're all assembled here. Yes, indeed. Un hmmm.
Yes, it's so nice I thought I'd work outside.
The girl worries me. If she walks down the street like that, an army will be following her.
She will succeed.
Is she all right?
No reason at all, darlin'.
Forgive my crudity, darlin'. All I'm saying is that a girl who would wear clothes like that is going to get in trouble sooner or later.
Yes, darlin', time will tell.
Yes! Yes, I say that to you, they were boys! Boy friends of Rose, chat's what they were, and why shouldn't she have boy friends? Do you want her to be unnatural? Don't you think she's human the same way you are yourself? It's the South, that's what it is, the South with its horrible traditions, of slavery and crime and the oppression of women, who are just as good as men and just as human!
And when I try to talk to you seriously, when I try to explain to you the unlimited creative power of life, how beautiful it would be if we gave up this hopeless struggle and simply loved each other from our hearts, what do you do -- you mock me!
Just a moment, dear.  We can't have it, Rose. Can you behave yourself -- or not? That is the question, to behave or not to behave, to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous chastity and keep your skirt down or to hoist it in the light of the moon and make whoopee -- that is the coil shuffling question.  If you can't behave I am going to fire you and I say it in front of you and Mrs. Hillyer and I mean it. I point my rigid finger right at your nose, Rose, and I stare unwaveringly into your big blue eyes and I tell you... this is a final warning. Do you hear me?
No, she doesn't, she's fine, fine. She's perfectly healthy, don't give her ideas.
Just a minute, Rose, you don't understand. This isn't a dirt farm like the one you were born on, it's nice. A neighbor of Cousin Hop's, I talked to him on the phone, a fine man... it's not a farm, damn it, it's a beautiful dairy establishment! Stop crying, Rose! Do you hear me? Stop crying, it's ideal!
Poor thing, don't cry, Rose. I know you feel awful, but don't cry, honey, nobody's perfect. Who's the father, dear?
Over... my... dead... body!
Well, now, darlin'... give me a chance to defend myself.
All right. Now as head of this household I have a couple of remarks to make. It is my dear wife's belief, which I accept although I do not totally grasp it, that to hire a person to do household work is a criminal practice. Therefore, you are here not as a servant, you are here as a friend, as a guest and hopefully as a member of this family. You will eat your meals with us, you will share life itself with us -- in love and harmony, dear Rosebud, in love and harmony. Do you understand me?
I... I'll get the grits.
Um-hmmuhh. I never drink a whole cup, my nerves can't stand the caffeine. Ehh-hh, Lord awful insomnia in reverse last night. Lay there and sweated blood for hours.
Yes, sir. I had to go to the bathroom.
Oh, anywhere downtown.
Oh, I'll just mosey around here and there.
Yes, sir.
Oh, no, sir.
That's all you've got to say, you've got a bad cold?
Perfect, wonderful, good as I ever felt! Except for a big old scar on my stummick, I wouldn't even know I been in the hospital.
What was it, Mr. Hillyer?
Well, that's interesting, Dave. I always liked Washington, it's a pretty town.
She's te reason -- cured me of women once and for all. Oh, I got rid of her, Buddy, I didn't waste no time kickin' that bitch out. Hell, she was screwin' everybody in Savannah. I caught her in a motel with this long tall son of a bitch and boy did I beat the everlastin' piss out of him!
Yeah, I remember it.
Daddy wouldn't hear that. Now the redhaired boy you see sitting there, of course you have met him, he is my oldest son and my most brilliant child. All children have great creative powers, but I don't want to rattle on about my children, they say I brag too much about them, especially about Brother. Am I boring you, Rose?
She looks terrible, just awful.
Deathly afraid of it. Her people were poor tenant farmers and she doesn't know anything about doctors or medicine or hospitals.
It is kind of amazing. The dentist says she has perfect teeth, there isn't a cavity in her mouth.
I beg your pardon, epi-zoo-tics? Do you mean "epi-zoo-ot-tics," an animal epidemic?
Let me be the judge of that, Madam.
Illusions, Madam?
Oh, Mother, cut it out.
Rose, sit down in that chair and be quiet! We're trying to help you, you silly creature, sit in that chair!
I know it's embarrassing... but who were you exposed to, dear? ROSE Well, now, Mrs. Hillyer, I... ah-h, that's kinda hard to say.
Rose, really, you shouldn't act like that.
I don't mind.
Maybe I'm not making myself clear. You're probably the first girl Billy-Boy's ever fallen in love with, and I know for sure you're the first he's slept with.  So, how's he gonna feel...  ... when he finds out that the only first he is for you is the first guy who didn't have to pull out at the last second to get his close-up?
Put up your kickstand, freak.  Start talking, or we're out the door.
I figure, for this information, the usual payment... times ten.
Hey, listen... I'll give you something else, Kittle.  Anything. Remember... remember that corpse washed up on Huntington Beach?  It was never identified...
Alright, wait... there's a dentist in Brentwood peddling morphine...
If I tell you, how do I know you won't just club me and take it back?
It's the way you say it, like there's something more too it.
No you can't.
I can not even begin to imagine how much that must have hurt.
Yeah.
Well, they sure know how to hold a grudge.
Clench your teeth.
Entertainers don't count.
They shot us all, kid.
Feeling great.
What was I supposed to do?
You'll cry like a great big, blubbering baby.
Follow me.
We have to find Kittle.
Can't you say something nice once?
What can I say to that... except, I love you too, you mean-spirited bitch.
What happened, Kittle?  We used to be friends.  You used to know how the game was played.
There was a time when you did things the right way, till you hooked up with that fat-assed-boozehound and the soul-sister.
Wave that flag, hero.  Keep dreaming those dreams.
Yeah, non-believer?  Here's yours...  "Scorpio, October 24 to November 22: Jupiter is in conflict with Saturn, so proceed with caution..."
What are you, communist?  At least numb-nuts here has the courtesy to pretend he likes them.
First of all, the Constitution wasn't writtem till 1787...
Second of all, the Declaration of Independence was all for liberty and equality, but it didn't do anything about slavery, did it?
Don't crowd him.
Out here.  On your knees.
Gimmie a minute.
Just got here.
Archibald Dobbs; Certified Public Accountant.  But, that's all we got.
Your wish is my command.
Seatbelts fastened, please.
There's not even enough places to stash it in a car.
Know what I love about dynamite?
When you bunch it together, it's exponentially more powerful.  Two sticks have the power of four sticks. Four sticks have the power of sixteen, and so on.
The way Zimmermann takes such good care of you and this drug-peddling "escort service" of yours, I figure you got the scoop on the pharmaceuticals arriving tonight.
All right. Stand by.
Vader humbled you when first you met him, Luke... but that experience was part of your training. It taught you, among other things, the value of patience. Had you not been so impatient to defeat Vader then, you could have finished your training here with Yoda. You would have been prepared.
I can't kill my own father.
She hasn't been trained in the ways of the Jedi the way you have, Luke... but the Force is strong with her, as it is with all of your family. There is no avoiding the battle. You must face and destroy Vader!
Where am I?
You have done well, Lord Vader. And now I sense you wish to continue your search for young Skywalker.
Everything is proceeding as I have foreseen.
Send the fleet to the far side of Endor. There it will stay until called for.
It is of no concern. Soon the Rebellion will be crushed and young Skywalker will be one of us! Your work here is finished, my friend. Go out to the command ship and await my orders.
Strange, that I have not. I wonder if your feelings on this matter are clear, Lord Vader.
That bad, huh? Where's Leia?
There's nothing to see. I used to live here, you know.
I have a promise I have to keep first... to an old friend.
Come on, Artoo.  We'll need your scanners.
Threepio, tell them if they don't do as you wish, you'll become angry and use your magic.
Leia!
Yeah, I just got a funny feeling. Like I'm not gonna see her again.
It'll work. It'll work.
It'll take time. This whole party'll be for nothing if they see us.
Charges!  Come on, come on!
Lower it!
Figured if I left you frozen like that you'd just give me bad luck the rest of my life, so I might as well get you unfrozen sooner or later.
You, too.
You may dispense with the pleasantries, Commander. I'm here to put you back on schedule.
Then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives.
Oh, no.
But, why must you confront him?
I will not turn...and you'll be forced to kill me.
I will not fight you.
Your father he is.
Yes.
I told you, my car broke down.
Hmmmm.  He'll be in the Zen Room.
And Ralph himself will be in line for promotion in a year or so.
I really loved the skilful way You beat the other girls To the bride's bouquet.
For you.
It's just a..a party Janet.
We can't go anywhere until I get to a phone.
It's alright Janet, we'll play along for now and pull out the aces when the time is right.
No, don't do that.
Uh - oh - Hi!  My name is Brad Majors. And this is my fiancee, Janet Weiss.  I - ah - wondered if you could help us.  Our car has broken down about two miles up the road.  Do you have a phone we might use?
From Transexual Transylvania.
Goodbye
They didn't like me.  They never liked me.
To you, to me it's Thursday.
Absolutely.
Ohh!
It doesn't bother me either.
I sold them to you.
I wanna let my brother know where I am.
Yes, I do.
It's not that --
I don't think I belong here.
Could ya take off that hat.
I don't know -- I was shocked. Why did you do that?
No... Sharp -- You look great.
Ya right --  Mebbe we best just hold hands -- the shirt made me feel guilty, y'know.
Yo -- I ain't mad. I'm just outta joint when reporters are around -- They take cheap shots an' Paulie knows it.
Yeah...
What're we going to do?
Hey, I want ya out instamaticly. -- I'm sicka lookin' at ya hangin' around like a friggin' spider -- Go out -- Live! Do, enjoy life.
Why?
...I don't feel heat from the name.
He's movin' to your left -- don't let him no more -- dance and stick, hear? Don't play -- I know what ya feelin', but don't play.
I contacted Ernie Roman's manager, he's fighting in France the same week.
He was big, an' very nasty so I destroyed him in a hurry -- Now I'm gettin' ready for Mac Lee Green next month.
Any quick advice for young boxing hopefuls?
...No wine -- Bad for ya' brain.
Are ya closed to the General Public or to just everybody.
Wait here, gotta smooth this guy out.
...Yeah, give 'er the Blades.
The Champion is smiling and toying with the man -- trying to give the fans their money's worth and make a show of it with the badly out-classes challenger -- Another left to right combination. I feel sorry for --
Don't mouth me, old man, I'll knock yo' out too. C'mon, wop, spar me, let everybody see who's got the heat around here.
Not yellow, cautious.  See, it's very easy for a fighter to accidentally hurt --
That's it, I'm broke.
I know the juice is climbin' -- I been workin' six months just to pay the damn interest.
...Fine.
Hey, screw ya brain on right. Now, who's this girl you're going out with tonight?
Thanks, Mr. Gazzo.
Take your shot, kid -- You got money for trainin' expenses?
I'm gonna do somethin with it.
Black market?
I wouldn't take no cheap shots. I'd be a good sparrin' partner.
...Like I said, I'd make a boss sparrin' mate.
I like 'em. If you don't you can f --
I won't.
Ya hope I don't keep acting like a whore or I'll turn into one, right?
Hey, how ya feelin', Mickey?
Yeah.
I was talkin' with ya man, Mike. -- Hey, how come I been put outta my locker?
...What?
You think everybody I fight is a bum.
...No.
Yeah.
I never had good footwork.
...I'm doin' it for a friend.
...The guy's great.
I'm thirty myself.
I don't see no crowd around you, neither.
Maybe ya should see a doctor.
He's takin' cheap shots.
Ya gotta have a guy help ya exercise, mebbe somebody to be standin' by with a towel or run errands, y'know.
I dunno -- she fills gaps.
She got gaps. I got gaps -- together we fill the gaps.
Feel? I dunno... Happy.
My problem is I got a fifty-year-old lust and a three-year-old dinkie.
You mean the rabbit?  They got him cold.
C'mon, Valiant, doesn't this whole thing smell a bit funny to you?  I mean, no offense, but how did a mucky-muck like R.K. Maroon find you in the first place?
Yeah, you still got it, Betty.  Who's Mr. Jocularity?
Shoulda guessed.
What are you complaining about?  Here's your fifty bucks.
Stick to stuffin' the olives, willya, Dolores?
Maybe Baby Herman was right.  Somebody wants Acme's property.  Cack the old man, pin it on Roger, and destroy the will.
Maroon, right?
Yes, we talked to Mr. Maroon.  He told us the rabbit became quite agitated when you showed him the pictures, and said nothing would stand in the way of him getting his wife back.  Is that true?
Yes, I find that weasles have a special gift for the work.  The rabbit didn't contact you by any chance, did he?
They?
Yeah?  Well, don't expect the Toons to give you a gold watch.
What the hell's a freeway?
Earl... it's me, Valiant.
That's because I don't have a doorbell.
Why didn't you tell me?
We're even.  By the way, I did find your husband.
Eddie, come on.
He was blowin' his lines, all right. So what?
The job's gonna cost you a hundred bucks.
Aren't you the lucky one...
Frankly, I'm shocked.  Marvin Acme's been my friend and neighbor for thirty years.
Valiant?  What're you doin' here?
Have you got the will?
Take it easy.
I needed a place to hide.  I'm in trouble, Eddie.
My brother.  Get inside.
Good idea.
Why, what is Tybalt?
Good-morrow, cousin.
Alas, that love, so gentle in his view, Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste.
I fear, too early: for my mind misgives Some consequence yet hanging in the stars Shall bitterly begin his fearful date With this night's revels and expire the term Of a despised life closed within my breast By some vile forfeit of untimely death. But He, that hath the steerage of my course, Direct my sail! On, lusty gentlemen.
Here is my gold. Worse poison to men's souls, than these poor compounds that thou mayest not sell.
The last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.
Sir, a ring my lady bid me give you.
What? Now. St. Peter's Church, and Peter too, he shall not make me there a joyful bride!
Romeo, I drink to thee.
Madam, I am here. What is your will?
I uh, by and by I come--But if thou mean'st not well, I do beseech thee--
Well, thou hast comforted me marvelous much. Go in and tell my lady I am gone, having displeased my father to Father Lawrence to make confession and be absolved.
Well, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do; They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.
Then move not, while my prayer's effect I take. Thus from my lips, by yours, my sin is purged.
Romeo, O Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo? Deny thy father and refuse thy name; Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, And I'll no longer be a Capulet.
Well what shall I swear by?
The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.
A thousand times good night! Exit, above
I must be gone and live, or stay and die.
Not I, Not I believe me: you have dancing shoes With nimble soles: I have a soul of lead
Under love's heavy burden do I sink.
I dream'd a dream to-night.
Right.
Sure Witt! Now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature.
Courage man, the hurt can not be much.
What wouldst thou have with me?
To make a point.  I don't know her, and I was ready to splatter her brains all over the sidewalk.  I don't particularly like you, so imagine what I'll do if you try anything...
Is that right?
I don't want you dead, woman, I want the the truth!
The deal?  The deal is we leave for Nice at first light.
And then...
That's why you were riding with him.
Some places, not all.  Italy, for instance, they're serious about their food.  But try bloody Britain, anywhere in the U.K., you don't get much fancier than a deep-fried bar egg.  Food's not our thing, you see.
It means I was worried that all the time you spent away from the fold might have affected you.  You've been living the life of the hired gun -- the well paid hired gun, I might note.  There's no glory to it, but there are those that like it.
They're good!
You were a soldier, were you?
Is that right?
You're a hired gun, Deirdre -- just like me.
Duty calls?
But would you stake your life, that's the question...
There's a problem...
I'm sure.  But I'm sorry to say that it's too late for trust: we have a serious problem.
He's a cop, Vincent, he's French and he's a cop and you better shoot him in the fucking head right now!
Edvard said the same thing about you before he died.
I swear, it has to come here!  It has to...
But you hate each other!
I got this gig through a contractor. And he most definitely didn't know who was doing the hiring, only that they were paying a lot of money...
I don't have it with me...
It's done.
I'm in the middle of saving you people a great deal of money -- the least you could do is have the decency to pay me!
I hadn't thought about it.  Understand me, Gregor -- I take no pleasure in killing.  It doesn't bother me one bit, but I don't get off on it.
Yes, Sam's tough alright.
Don't worry, we'll take care of it.
Call it a reckoning of character.
Gets the job done.
Did he bring that with him?
Who the fuck died and appointed you food czar?
It's consider a virtue in some corners of the world.
I know cops -- and you're no cop.
I asked if we could give him anything else.
Jujitsu.
I have, I don't know, maybe a cigarette a week.
I do.
Let's just say I thought the conversational possibilities were limited.  Of course, I might have brought Gregor, but he didn't seem like the right candidate -- for this.
I wonder if she truly left the IRA.
I needed to see if you were a cop.  I'm a popular man with the police, Sam, and whenever they try to catch me they always do it with an inside guy -- some man on some job who seems more trustworthy than all the others put together.  And that's the guy you have to watch out for.  I hate cops...
Because that's what I would have done...
Gregor's cell phone...
You weren't around when I woke up, I thought maybe something had happened.  This has been one very fucked up job, Sam, and I'm not taking any more chances on anybody...  Including you...
I never really thought I was part of the world you move in, Sam, to tell you the truth.  I'm a hood, a thief.  Big time in a small time king of way.  To the local police I'm a prize, to the local hoods I'm a legend.  But to a guy like you I'm just another two bit hired gun.
But you can't.
Not exactly.
This doesn't involve you, don't you understand?  I can't even guarantee you any money out of all this.
Good.  Now take the forceps, and remember, Vincent, what we're doing here is routine.  I've done stuff like this at least twenty times in the field.  There are no vital organs where you're working, no major muscles or arteries -- you can't kill me.  Just make sure you've got the bullet before you try to pull it out.
Do what?
Dark ops?
I was waiting to see what would happen. I didn't want to kill him if I didn't have to.
I would have tried not to.  But yes, if it would have kept him from shooting you, I would have.
You think?
I don't know...
Business keeps you on the road?
So I do it.
If our positions were reversed, would you leave me?
I think not.
Closest and oldest.
Do you have a good answer?
Finish it!
You don't owe me a goddamned thing, Vincent, and you know it.  You stepped in front of a bullet for me.  I owe you a heavy debt.
I don't know.  Nobody knows, except a bunch of people who are too dead to tell us.  There's probably a couple of guys back at the Company who know, but I don't think they plan to tell me anytime soon.
It's an international thing.  Several different peoples involved, criminals from all over the world, experts brought together to do a job.  But maybe the most interesting thing about it is that preeminent in the plot we find the Russian Mob and the IRA in bed together. An unlikely group of partners.
How is it these fellahs managed to get the drop on us?
You should have kill him when you had the chance.  But no...
You slept with the fucker!!
Matter of face there's this flick I've been hearing about.  I haven't seen it, but from what I hear it's pretty cool.
I get the picture.
I gotta try and overcharge him, he has to moan about the price, we settle somewhere in the middle.
None of them had any --
Well I hope so.  That pretty much cleaned me out.
Cash and what?
I probably would have.  I guess the clues damn near before everyone.
They're out of towners... Arizona plates...
There must be over a million dollars in here.
What do you mean what are we going to do?
Robbed a bank, c'mon!  Don't you think we would have heard if one, two --  shit I don't know how many were at large!  Don't you think there would be a bulletin?  This is a big ass drug deal!
Why?
Suppose someone knows about the money?  They're bound to ask questions.
Oh so God's like Western Union and he just dropped us a couple million bucks?
Torch it?!
What's that?
Well, we won't do any of that shit!
You're thinking about killing him.  I can't do that.  No way.  I've never killed a man.  Never even shot at one...
That's not what I mean.
I don't know...
What are you thinking?
Well doesn't he?  Besides if the DEA heard that tape we'd be behind bars right now.  Just call it the cost of doing business.  This whole thing is screwed up.  I'm thinking.  Maybe we should tell 'em the truth...
For Christ's sake, Booth, I just needed to take care of a few debts is all!  You got my word on it --I'm not going near it again until everything cools down.
Well I mean it this time.  Come on.  Let's get this over with!
I'm just making our intentions clear. Go check the desk.
You killed him...
We're doing what we gotta do, to protect ourselves!
Come on. Booth grabs the bag --
Then we're screwed.
We'll take the money and disappear! We can do it, spend it on the move. Even if all of it's marked, there's ways around it.
He killed her...he killed her...
It's not about the money anymore. Can't you see that?  It's about
Two thousand...
What are you proposing?
Maybe.  That's where it was during Denning's last report.
Oh.  You coming by tonight?
Are you sure you're OK?
I love you too.
Booth.  Don't.  It's nothing. It's not worth it.  Remember what happened the last time?
I know.
I hate it when you talk like this.  Go on.
Well I was just throwing out ideas...
I don't know.  My friends...
Am I speaking English here?  How-about-you-give-us-what-you- have-and-leave?
Don't worry the real men are in charge now.
Damn! MARTIN I'm sorry to have dragged you all the way down here for that.  I thought maybe it would help. Booth lets out an inaudible deep breath -- Earl immediately plays up to Martin, clearly relieved --
We appreciate that.
Why would someone do that?
Hell no. besides I'm just a radio call away if something happens. I feel I should keep abreast of what happens, seeing it's my jurisdiction and all.
Fine.  The information doesn't leave this room.
Hi.
No I don't.  You sure you haven't seen her?
Oh, that's ok, a lot of men feel uncomfortable when they come in here.
Oh yeah.  Between here and Vegas we get a lot of customers.  All types.  Even had an officer, just like you.
I mean at least pick a more discreet place, the scalp, under the armpit, under the tongue, someplace where the trained eye won't immediately look.
Yeah whaddya want?.
Well, we got the DEA coming down here again, I don't know, sounds to me like they got some more questions they want to ask us.
Well, I just got a lot of things on my mind is all.
What?
I can't hear a word you're saying!
Just trying to be civil Dwayne.
Look I worked all day, I'm tired as hell and I want to sit and eat in peace!  Is that asking too much?
Calm down --
Then what the hell are you all about?
I was in the neighborhood.
Yeah.
Yeah sure I'll grab something before I go...  Hey -- I've got a surprise.
Ah, hell I'll get one soon enough.  Besides, I want you to have it.
Anything in it?
So someone did get away.
Hong Kong?  I'm not in Hong Kong.  I'm in Hollywood -- right at Sunset and Vine, two minutes from the station.  How about I pick you up right now and take you to dinner?
Two-hundred thousand dollars?  Who wants a hundred dollars?
I got held up at a wedding in Tai Koo. Ricky here yet, I need to get his requests.
What??  Where'd you hear that?
I ain't his partner, I'm a tourist.  I got proof.  See, I got a mini-bar key.
Never leave home without it.  Lee, this one's on me.  You save your money.
I'm just in town for the weekend, taking in the sights.
Detective Carter, you always seem to show up where you don't belong.
Vegas has been my town for 30 years.  I crawled out from under the first rock. Do you really think you can intimidate me here?
You play games with me, Detective, and you'll lose every time.  Don't forget. The odds are always in favor of the house.
Don't be giving me attitude, Lee.  I've been here three days and we haven't done shit.  We haven't been to a club, haven't even talked to a girl.  I'm on vacation, and I want some mu-shu.
No.
Are you kidding, they love me.  I'm a star, Lee.  A god to these people!
Tread softly?  Who taught you how to roost a bar?
You mean Tito.  We had  Toto for dinner last night.
How you doin'?
My bullshit?  I'm not the one who goes to a karaoke bar filled with gangsters! I'm not the one who goes to massage parlors to bust crime lords!
I'll bitch slap you into Bangkok.
You said --
Why LA?
Yeah, what about when Godzilla was coming?  You people were screaming your asses off.
How do you know?
Let me guess, she couldn't handle the cop thing -- never knowing if you were dead or alive.  I've seen it a million times.
Gimme the binoculars or I will shoot you.
She just took her hair down.  Now she's going for the bra -- the clasp is in front -- she's using both hands.  You better get that ice.
It's your turn!
Is it the same heaven, or is it a Chinese heaven?
Fine by me.
There was no sex.  She was very traditional.  We were waiting until we were married.
Forget it.  It doesn't matter.
They'll probably torture us first, shock our privates, then put two bullets in our eyes and one in the back of the head.
Lee.  I just got an idea how someone could launder a hundred million dollars in cash.
Dancing?
MMMMMM!!!!
I did!
Amen to that, brother.
Hey, you, Secret Service Man, what are you --
I need your help.
How do I know I can trust you?
Any leads?
Are you okay, Lee?
The police can protect you.
Tell me why they killed the customs agents.
Yes, Master.
The first drop will be made tomorrow. At twelve o'clock.  The amount will be fifty million.
Okay, I'll slow down.  So we go downtown and we ask you a few questions... you know, like what's your name?  How old are you?  You ever expose yourself in public...shit like that.
No.
I am not responsible for your assumptions.
What is that, some kind of Chinese proverb?
Yes. He was part of the Juntao crime family. He may be Juntao himself.  And he dropped this.
Stool pigeon.
It's him.
It ain't your ass, it's my ass you're backin' up.  Take the damn gun.
Oh yes.
Be sorry for Soon Young. She has no chance now.
What?
With the FBI. What do you think I'm talking about?
OK. Well...make us proud.  And be careful.
We saved the girl and got the bad guys, didn't we?
At this point we don't have much.
Sir, he's just gonna get in my way. If I'm gonna handle this situation...
Don't worry about the kidnapping, Carter, the F.B.I. will handle that. Your assignment is Lee.
Just make him think you're following leads.  Interview some suspects, look at fingerprints, do detective shit.  I don't care.  I just don't want to see him- or you, for that matter- until this is resolved.  Now, we want to make a good impression, don't we?  His plane lands in an hour. Don't be late.
That's what you were supposed to be!
Do it!
You don't. He finds you. Through his people.
She's fine.
Ambassador, let me assure you that the FBI has made this a top priority. We have plenty of manpower on the case.
Yes sir, me too. The State Department has authorized release of the funds. We'll have to make the first drop at 7.  As soon as they pick up the money, we've got ?em.
Don't worry, he's with Carter.
I was trying to find the right time.
Ike just came by to check out the team.
Let him come to the wedding.  You're not running, right?  Say it. "I'm not..."
I lead Maggie through a visualization exercise.  All the sports shrinks use this head stuff.  Visualize the end zone, if you catch my drift.
I didn't want to find out I wasn't for her in the fourth quarter.
What did he ask?
Weird.  Like after all those years you would remem--
What?
I'm sorry, Ike.  This is permanent.
No.  No, you didn't.
I'm sorry, too.  Wow.  That only took us between years to say.
The real story on Miss Carpenter.
"Paid vindication"  That's what I call justice.
This is about her negative attention, not mine.  Did you get the reimbursement for the dress yet?
I don't know.
And end up in the papers?  I've been humiliated enough already to last a lifetime, thank you.  I'm sorry she got you canned.
Not bad.  I was traveling around studying the reproductive and migratory patterns of locusts when Maggie met me.
Excuse me, sir.  I have an actual fact for you.
No, I'm not.
Peggy Phleming.  Not the ice skater.
Bye, Betty.  Thanks.
Well, wedding cake freezes.  This we know.
Gotta tell you this about my daughter. My daughter makes real good time, even in a long dress and heels.  Maggie may not be Hale's longest running joke, but she certainly is the fastest.
Despite what you think, I don't do it on purpose.  And I have no intention of doing it again.
Cindy the manicurist.
You afraid to try?
Highly suspect.
Now that's romantic.  A proposal like that and you didn't find eternal bliss? What went wrong?
Maybe you should ask her some time. Ever thought of that?
You know, there's no...
Gram here was going to give me the skinny on why you run from marital bliss.
Can you fix it?
Missed me bad, huh?
What kind of Dead Head gets a temporary tattoo?
I love you, too.
Well, you do have the dress.
So am I.
I didn't even need to change this gasket, just put in a little hydraulic fluid.
Thank you.  Do you think I flirt with Cory?
No.  I'm weird.  Weird and mysterious are two different things.
It's only funny at Camp Birchwood at three in the morning at a tick hunt. It's not anymore.
Lighten up, what?
No, no.  I saw eight geese flying in a "V".
Not eight...
Wedding.  Wedding.  You just have to get the rest of your ducks in a row.
Quick.  Very quick.
Thank you, Dad.
No.  It's my life.
No, it's humiliating and you've been doing it since I was a kid.  I don't like it.  Stop.  You may not like having a daughter with problems.  But guess what?  I don't like having a father who's drunk all the time.  I'll eat in my room.
No.
It sounds nice.
Houseboats don't go anywhere.
It's not a boat boat.  It's really a house.
-- who is the most competitive woman in the world --
Today I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth.
How will I get back to Baltimore Saturday?  Oh God, I forgot my present for your stepmother -- I took it inside by accident.
Don't be silly.  I'll just be ten minutes behind you.
Go for a walk in Central Park --
Oh, it's just Becky, she's having trouble with Rich again.  Hold on, Becky, I'm going downstairs.
It's just like my grandmother's china.
There's practically a whole book about how that statistic is not true --
I'm going to marry Walter.  I just have to get this out of my system.
I should say something in this about magic.
No.
And then you left him? He lost weight there and you left him?
You'd probably have to go somewhere to really look into it.
Becky?
So I mailed your letter.
I'm going to run back to Walter's arms, if he's still have me.
We're going to the Rainbow Room and the symphony tomorrow night.
Do you want a matrimonial, past wives, any kids--
So you want a financial, is he a deadbeat, we can do a D&B --
I know. 
I want my money.
That's what I'm going to do. I'm going to go home.  I quit.  Laurie, I quit.  I'm going back to Baltimore.  How does a blonde do a high- five?
And you crazy? He thinks shows like this are dumb.  If you didn't have an 800 number I could never get away with this --
How am I going to explain this to Walter?
Howard.
You'll love them.  We're going down to D.C.  tonight to be with them Christmas morning.
How amazing.
Destiny takes a hand.
What?
It's me?
The cabinets have to be redone --
The point is, take the client out to dinner and ask her to marry you and then maybe we won't have to redo the kitchen cabinets.
Thanks, but I'll pass.  It's kind of a big night.  I don't like to leave Jonah alone.
I'm not selling anything.  Your son called and asked for advice on how to find you a new wife.
I think it's hard for him to talk to you about all this. Maybe we could talk and it would make him feel a little better.
What's she talking about?
It's not for me.  It's for my dad.  I think he needs a new wife.
He doesn't have one now. That's the problem.
Why not?
You want me to talk to him?
Yeah.
Well, okay.  What's the big deal?  If she'll forget the new fireplace, I'll marry her. Just point me in the right direction.
I don't think it could let a woman pay for dinner.
What is it?
Some woman is going to want me to do it to her and I'm not going to know what it is.
I don't know.  Do I?
Oh, you're changing your mind --
Shouldn't you have used a toggle bolt?
They called and asked for it.  "Dear Sleepless in Seattle. You are the most attractive man I've ever laid ears on."
Oklahoma.  Do you know where that is?
There she is.
She's going to cook something for us?
Okay.
No.
Victoria? She's okay.
I was scared of what you were gonna do.
You look good yourself.
You did?
That's none of their affair.
How's it going?
Whose side are you on anyway?
I've tried everything but shootin' 'em down.
You want 'em all arrested?
Yeah.
An American.
It isn't right, she says. Was it right that we bought this ... this instrument?
I listen to it. Every night. When you're out to the beer parlor.
Antonio paid for it.
No, no ... we wouldn't do it.
Yes. To plan for the picket line tomorrow.
We can't go on this way. I just can't go on living with you. Not this way.
Aah! They've got other mines. You don't see the larger picture.  They've got millions. Millions. They can outlast us, and they know it.
Shut up, you're talking crazy.
Will you be still?
Then why's the company hanging tough? They've signed contracts with other locals -- why not this one?
It's Mama's Saint's Day.
She's coming. Charley Vidal gave her a lift.
I don't want you hanging around there, hear?
You ... You ... I'd expect it of an Anglo, yes ... but you ...
No.
Yeah? First door on the right. It ain't that dirty.  Just kinda' filthy is all.
Yeah.
Not even a guess?
Did you see his hair color?
First rate, ain't it?
Now that's down-right insulting.
Colette ...
I can't. I've got a kid.  She lives with my parents.  Quincey knows where they live.
Nothing.
You really need to lighten up.
Who the fuck are you? Dr. Joyce Brothers?
You don't like the tune, find another station.
Please open the door, Danny.
You can still work.
I want to do this for you.  I want to do something good for a change.
Never mind. Just do what I say. He holds out the baggie. Colette backs away.
Why?
I don't want to leave you.
You've got to deal with this sooner or later, Tom. You can't keep hiding.
I hadn't noticed.  I've seen you around.  What's your name?
Can your man handle that?
Personal protection. It's a dangerous world we live in, Jimmy, a very dangerous world.
No. I'm good.
You're my best friend, man. I'd do anything for you.
I don't trust anybody.
Because I don't want to see you end up like Kujo and those other losers.  I thought that maybe if you knew that I didn't use, you might see it in yourself to go clear.
Understand what?
Make me an offer.
Anything for a dear friend.
Big Bill
Don't do that. Please.  Or I'll kill you.  Please, Danny.
Just some buddies.
Yeah, dickhead.
Bobby, rhymes with hobby.
It was all pretty informal.  Didn't have a lot of time to exchange pleasantries.
God damn, Flynne, you are one observant tweaker.
Hard to compare the people you're taking down with the Lord.
It's not my place.
Bobby laid his own tracks.  He could have gone quietly but he played the hard-ass con till the end. And as far as I'm concerned, he wife and kid are a hell of a lot better off without him.  Now take the money.
Tell me what?
Question is, what are you doing here?
What's to stop him from just ripping me off then?
Jesus.
It speaks!
What's he holding?
To who?
I still don't know what you're talking about.
Who the hell is Jimmy?
Hell, yes!  What the hell do you expect zapping Mr. Johnson with that crackler?
I'm making the small buy tonight ... if I don't get beaten to death with a wheelchair or something.  If everyone is happy, we'll do the big deal later in the week.
Again, I thank you.
Good work, Flynne.  You're a first-rate rat.
Maybe he isn't showing.
What is it, drugs?
No, you can't taste it.  It's the fucking lab! Now shut up.
I'm sending Simpson to take over for you, the division is going to Caen, you're not coming with us, I have something else for you.
Thank you, sir.
You writin' a book or somethin'?
Reiben, are you makin' fun 'a the way I talk?
Like hell, you did.
What deal?
Gives Wade the second shot.
You'll grieve the way I tell you to goddamned grieve.  There is no Wade, there was one, but he died a long time ago, he's been dead for so long you can hardly remember his name, you understand?
Say what, Cap'n?
Senator's son?
I heard.
Don't need it, I'm a cat, I've got five lives.
What do they know?  I had nine, but I feel through the ice when I was seven, my brother pulled me out.  Then I used one when a grenade landed in my foxhole in Sicily, it was a dud.  I figure one on the beaches, one on the cliffs and two getting here.
Plenty.
Same place we are.
Those are Tigers, they have six-inch armor, they don't even notice grenades.
But, sir...
You tryin' to get yourself killed?
We in radio contact with anybody up there?
Hell of a mission.
Tell that to Private James Ryan. We've got our orders.  Let's go.
About to pour his sulfa.  Sees the wound.  Stops.  Knows it's fatal.
Vecchio.
Not in so many words, but they tell you you can have all the firepower in the world and if your men don't have good morale, it's not worth a damn.  So if you're scared or empty or half-a-step from a Section Eight, do you tell your men?  Of course not.  You bluff, you lie.
That's the rub.  I liked Wade.  Who's Ryan?  If they're both standing in front of me and I have to shoot one or the other, how do I choose?  Look at my hand, there it goes again.
I think you're right, Keith.
Well, if we had ten times the men and a lot more ammo, we might stand a chance, but not against those tanks.
We're going to hope like hell the tanks were on their way somewhere else.
Just picture some French number been spending all day, every day, making cream-colored, shear-body negligees with gentle-lift silk cups and gathered empire waists, what the hell you think she wears at night?
You have orders, too.
Why's that?
Except for the last part, that one's not bad.
Has anyone ever told you, you're officer material?
More tanks...  Ryan Lot's of them The fear on their faces turns to resignation.  They know that they are dead men.  They settle into their positions, and prepare to fire and die.
Races through the debris.  Trailed by BULLETS.
That's because, as I have pointed out on numerous occasions, you are a happy idiot.
Fertilizer, Captain, I think we're in a cranberry bog.
Captain, he's fast!
We know.
Since I was nine years old.  They got a lot of explosives around mines. Me and my little brother could get into any warehouse you ever saw. Damn, we had fun!
Twenty-four-five.
Understanding the following rights...
Mr Court, be aware that we will be contacting a number of your business associates...
What family?  We never heard from them.  I sold her house for them, made them money.
I hope you understand.
Jesus Christ.  I get in a good mood.  How hard is it just to decide to be in a good mood, and then be in a good mood?
He's a mess!
Forget it, forget it, it's mine, it's mine!
See you tomorrow.
I admit nothing.
You've got to do something special.  You've got to make a statement.
Lloyd, you have to understand her family is being ripped apart. Like you and she were ripped apart.  Like Joe and I were ripped apart.
Diane Court does not realise how good-looking she is.
Meaning?
And above all, just because this happened gives you no right whatsoever...
I dream about it.
Well, since I'm not only your father, I'm also your friend; I had to get you two presents.
You won it.  You're going to study at the finest institute at England, the toughest fellowship in the country, and you won.
Okay, I give up.
I'm fine.
Diane, I'm not asking you to sever all relations with the boy. Give him a present, here, let him know you still care.  Give him this pen.
Swear to god, I need to know the truth.
Swear to god.
But I found the money.
You stole from them, you lied to me.  How do you think that's supposed to make me feel?
No, I will.  I don't want to leave something out because I know I can say anything to you.  You're a liar, and a thief.
I'm so ashamed dad.
Okay.  Oh, here's Ray.  Just talk to him because when you don't, your mouth turns down.
Hi.  You called me?
Yeah.  What a day.
Yes, we sat together at Bell's Square.
Oh, thanks, but I'm busy.
No tips.  I won't give you any tips of any kind.
Pardon me?
Eight.
Would you hold this for me?
No.
Job?  Being a great date.
So am I. I want to see you again.  I want to see you as much as I can before you leave.  I said it.
Yeah.
I'm doing alright.
This is so noble.
You're cold.
It was wonderful.
Okay, how much time do you need?  I mean, you know, I mean you'll be leaving in a little while, so that's answered some questions. 
You have Corey and DC.  I have my dad.
Lloyd, I love you, okay?
I love you.
Work that jab, work that hook, work that jab, okay, take a break, take a break.
Hello.  May I please speak with Diane please?
Uh, no, not really, no actually, basically, you don't know me. I'm a friend of your daughters; well I sat with her yesterday at the mall.
Oh.  Okay then... Lloyd Dobler, 555-1342.
Go ahead, pick it up if you want.
Well Lloyd, I admire you for not hitching a ride.  You know, my daughter's a lot different to you.
You're not a permanent part of her life.  You're a distraction.
I'm incarcerated, Lloyd!  I don't deserve to lose my daughter over this.  I don't deserve to have you as my go-between.  And I can't for the life of me figure out how she could choose to champion in mediocrity the way she flirts around you.
I know this part, keep reading.
So what's up?
Dude, why do you think I keep her tapes?  They're going to be valuable some day.
Dude, I can't do it!
How ya doin' Miss Evans?
What?
I'm Lloyd Dobler.
Alright!
Alright, I love you too. Go to sleep.
My plant manager is somewhere on this train. If it leaves with him on it, it'll disrupt production and the Armaments Board will want to know why.
I feel like an old-fashioned couple. It feels good.
I'd say I'd get you one but the guy who made it, he's probably dead, I don't know.
They're not gone, they're here.
True.
I pay you too much.
These people, my people, I want my people.
It's good for me - I know them, I'm familiar with them.  It's good for you - you'll be compensated.  It's good for the Army.  You know what I'm going to make?  Artillery shells.  Tank shells. They need that.  Everybody's happy.
The guards aren't allowed on the factory floor. They make my workers nervous.
Look it up.
There's nothing in the stores.
I don't know, ten or twelve.  That's a good color.  Dark blues, grays.
I've been here.  I guess I haven't been out.
Done.  Lets not talk about it anymore, let's have a good time.
So I'll talk to him about it.
Simple engineering, though, wouldn't you think?  Change the machines around, whatever you do, you could make other things, couldn't you?
There's a machinist outside who'd like to thank you personally for giving him a job.
Do what?
Thank you.
Oskar -
Are you losing money?
There's nothing you can do.  I'm not asking you to do anything.  You came into my office.
No, no, what, what is it?
You did so much.
He was a metal press operator, quite skilled.
On national television.
What? I can't hear you...
What if I said you?
You could start with an apology.
You wrote me a letter. Very cordial. Very appropriate.
Did you do it?
Why don't you ask them?
You're all in this together?
Enter Cotton Weary.
Hey, it's cool. Hallie's into it, I'm into Hallie...
It's under control.
No, it's not.
It's not you, Derek. I don't trust myself. I tend to make big selection errors when it comes to men.
Good question. You took the bait.
Damned if I know. She ditched me.
I really don't like that comparison, honey.
I read her postings on the horror movie chat boards and fell hopelessly. Hook, line...
Just for you, Sid.
Tails.
Tuition's expensive.
I see you read the book.
What are we looking for?
Dewey, you and I would never make it.
Shit! It's both of them. The first murders were to throw us - using the same names as Woodsboro. But they've moved on- -they're getting closer to Sidney. They're not looking for a Himbry or a Tatum to kill. They're looking for the new Tatum.
They thought it was a publicity stunt.
They don't know. It was carefully planned. Earlier in the day the victims received anonymous passes to the movie.
Don't worry...
Whatever.
What if your life depended on it?
Stay away from the cop.
No, Gale, I'm just getting started. Seeya soon.
My morn was a Delta.
Oh my God.
Don't do this.
But I love you. And I want the whole world to know it.
Hello?  Hello?
I've got my entourage. Take a break. Please.
No, Hallie, I'm not gonna take you down too. I'll be alright.
Maureen looks at Phil, confused...as if seeing for the first time...IT'S NOT PHIL. She pulls away when, the Ghost-masked Figure grabs her with one hand, the other one clutching the hunting knife. Maureen sees it, her mouth billowing forth a LOUD SCREAM That is matched by the entire audience as they SCREAM at the screen.
Her old boyfriend?
But...
But...
Shush.
Listen to me. We've got to get help. The Killer's here.
Where you going?
I'm sorry, Sid, please. I never should have gone along with Gale. I know I'm stupid. I wish I had some good reason to give you but I'm just stupid. Please, Sid, don't be mad at me.
Melinda McGraw?
Heh heh I bet they are babe. I bet they are. Look, my battery's dying . . .
Who is this?
I'd love to help, really I wouldn't mind being sliced at again by a maniacal psychopath, but I honestly don't know where Sidney is. After Windsor she dropped off the face of the Earth. The only other person that might know is, , not going to talk.
I go to the police station and do my job, and you go back to being Gale Weathers.
Ben Damon. Christine Perkins. Sarah Darling. Tom Prinze. That's four, last time I learned how to count.
He killed Milton! The killer's  inside there! Oh God!  DEWEY! Dewey's in there too! He needs medical help! He's hurt!
Why didn't you tell me?  This is my mother, Dewey. Why didn't you say something?
You mean like, movie trilogies?
Understood.  If you'll excuse me Detective.  Gale.
He could've monitored the calls on a scanner. Did you call her from the set?
Do you want me to come with you Sid? I mean, remember what Randy said?
This has everything to do with me Dewey. I was the one who brought the nation's attention to this shit anyway. I'll be damned if I'm gonna sit around and pass on the buck again.
Yes. Look, let's get something straight Dewey, I got into this shit cause the police came looking for ME. Not cause I'm out to make the SUNRISE STUDIOS SLASHINGS.
It didn't work Dewey.  We tried,  we're different.
I'm sorry, this is too good!
Neither are you, Magnum P.I.
Amen boy scout, now answer the fucking door!
Nevermind, what'd you two find?
But you know who she was.
Dewey, what the hell is she rambling about now? What's wrong Jen, see yourself on one of those USA NETWORK winners you did and realize how badly you suck at acting?
I don't know. Screw them. Look, what's important is that we stick together. No matter what. If anyone is next it's you or me Jen.
Oh shit it's my cell!
There a story in that building?
Good twist.
Milton's not a killer. He's a pervert. He probably went out to buy more KY JELLY for his jack -off parties he has with his two best friends.
GALE WEATHERS?! What are you doing here? No press on the set!  No press, no press on set! Get that woman out of here.
Yeah.
Now you listen to me, Lois Lane, let it go. It's dead and buried. Daddy took ol' Yeller out behind the barn and shot him in the head a long time ago.
It was in the 70's, everything was different. I was well known for my parties, Rina knew what they were. It was for girls like her to meet men, men who could get them parts, if they made the right impression.  Nothing happened to her that she didn't invite, in one way or another, no matter what she said afterwards.
Heh, well, that's TV journalism for ya. Stage the news to boost ratings.
Oh, you know, the usual small talk, "What's new, how ya been, how do you want to die?"
What are you talking about?
Who's this?
Roman that's not the line.
Has there been another goddamn rewrite? How  the fuck are we supposed to learn our lines when there's a new script every 15 minutes?
And still the film is Number One at the box office this weekend. Beat out American Pasty and Arlington Street.
SCENE 32. INT. CANDY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT. "What are you talking about Ricky, the murders were a completely isolated incident".
Damn. He called my roommate and told her he had some important things he wanted to go over with me in his office tonight.
She'd have been so happy, Sidney, to know we'd be together.
You're doing real good. Can't you figure it out? I wanna finish this where it all began. Woodsboro.
Are you sure?
No one's saying you did.
Oh...
You know it.
Yeah...
Odds are -- she'll miss anyway.
Where the fuck did she go?
I'm sorry. Don't hate me.
What are you doing here?
So you thought you could sneak in my window and we would have a little bump-bump.
I'm going... I'm going.
What's that?
The police say I scared him off. It wasn't me, Sid.
Is it the sex thing? Am I being too pushy?
You lost your mom...
Or even a good porno.
Who is this?
I don't know.
I'm sorry. I guess I dialed the wrong number.
What's that noise?
You're making popcorn?
Really? What?
So, you gotta boyfriend?
Wait... I thought we were gonna go out.
Don't hang up on me.
More of a game, really.
His name wouldn't be Steve, would it?
No...
Name the killer in HALLOWEEN.
Come on. It's you favorite scary movie, remember? He had a white mask, he stalked the baby-sitters.
It was Jason. I saw that goddamned movie twenty times. It was Jason.
I know who you are, ma'am. How's the eye?
You are precious. Please, call me Gale.
Can I bring Kenny?
Nah... it's just this town's way of not taking me serious.
I don't think you're so bad.
Sidney's father?
Somebody called me, Dewey. I'm not making it up.
Hey, I saw that movie. True story, 'bout some killer in Texas.
What were you doing out here?
What about the cellular phone bill?
Keeping my eye on Sidney.
Couldn't his cellular number have been cloned?
I told you to send it back.
Not my daughter... not my...
Jesus! The camera-hurry!
When did that ever stop you? You can't sit on this. This is huge.
It'll be out later this year.
I'll send you a copy.
Kenny. Camera. Now.
I owe you shit.
Has his story changed?
Who are you?
Got it.
Sleep tight, sweetie.
She's the Scream Queen.
Yeah, I'm off early -- curfew you know.  Now that's poor taste.
There's always some stupid bullshit reason to kill your girlfriend. That's the beauty of it all. Simplicity. Besides, if it's too complicated you lose your target audience.
Maybe Sidney wouldn't have sex with him.
Could be. Now that Billy's tried to mutilate her, you think Sid would go out with me?
So while they're off investigating a dead end, Billy, who's been written off as a suspect, is busy planning his next hunting expedition.
Like you had one.
Wanna another beer?
Are you kidding? This is like Christmas.
Are you serious?
Yeah, okay... whatever.
You guys can go up to my parents room? To talk and... whatever.
They think it's school-related?
I'll be there by seven. I promise
Her dad's out of town. She's staying with us.
I want you to meet me here right after class, okay?
If they were having an affair how come that Cotton couldn't prove it in court?
And you believe it?
Don't go there, Sid. You're starting to sound like some Wes Carpenter flick. Don't freak yourself out -- we've got a long night ahead of us.
Come on, let's rock.
Oh, Sidney. WHAT? A guy can talk tits til he's dead but the minute you mention an eight inch weenie. Watch out.
Deal.
Thank you.
What about the trace on his bank account and the guns?  There must be something to connect him with a past.
You're wound too tight, Mills.  Let it go.
I'm in.
So what?  This victim...
Everything else was taken as close to conclusion as humanly possible.  Also... this shouldn't be his first assignment.
I'll get a job, maybe on a farm.  I'll work on the house.
What are you talking about?
He's not finished.
We figure you need all the tools you can get to fix up that piece of shit you call a house.
Who are you?  What are you doing out here?
Hello.
Why?
You know that's not true.
Murderers?
It's close.
Shut up!
Guessing at this point is useless.
Have you found any plastic scrapings near the stove or sink?  Near the food?
All day Saturday, and all day Sunday.  The murderer would want Gould to take his time.  To have to sit there and decide. Where do you make the first cut?  There's a gun in your face... but, what part of your body is expendable?
Like, because someone's holding a gun on you.
Then, you tell me what you think we're doing.
Bullshit.
I want him bad.  I don't just want to catch him anymore.  I want to hurt him.
A landlord's dream tenant: a paralyzed man with no tongue.
It's a fine line between insane and inspired.
No.
Him?
What?  Assessing fines?
Saint Thomas Aquinas.  He wrote about the seven deadly sins.
It was him.
What the fuck is wrong with you?
I'm trying, alright?  Just tell me what we've got.
You're the oldest man I know, Somerset.
No I'm not!  I'm talking about common, everyday life here.  If you let yourself worry about one thing, you'll worry about the next, and the next, and it never ends. In this place, ignorance isn't just bliss, it's a matter of survival.
Big surprise.
You and I are, probably for the first time ever, in total agreement.  He wouldn't just stop.
Well, I have to tell you...  I think I've fallen in love with you.
Wait!
What are you talking about?  What happened?
I... I don't understand.
What?  Oh, yes.  I mean, thank you.  Please, sit down.
Talk to him about it.  He'll understand if you tell him how you feel.
I want to have children.  It's just...
They gave up...went back to the cotton rows...So'd the Jamisons... Without Martha, I don't know...She wouldn't let a man quit.
What, Ben?
I ain't wearing no gun.
This 'un come a long way 'fore he died.
You're right sure you want to <U>jump</U> 'em, Ethan?
...as you have of findin' those girls alive by ridin' into 'em... I say we do it my way, Ethan...and that's an order!
There sure is! I'm going to tell you somethin'...I wasn't going to speak of it...But I'll tell you now. Did you notice them scalps strung on Scar's lance?  Did you see the third scalp from the point of the lance? Long... wavy hair...
Yes, sir...Troop's about ten miles back...The Colonel sent me looking for you...
Swear it, Ethan?...Given word?
Name's Ethan...Now what's so mighty fishy about this trail?
Easy!  It's forty miles, sonny...Horses can do with some grain and a little rest.
Leggo...
Sorry...We don't even know if Debbie 'n Lucy are with this bunch...Maybe they split up...
YOUR cattle?...<U>DEBBIE'S</U> cattle!
Yeah...you want me to know I ain't got no kin -- no money -- no horses -- nothing but a dead man's clothes to wear!..You tole me that already... Now shut your head!
Maybe I'm gettin' like Mose Harper -- my bones is cold tonight...
Scar?
Think it might be...?
She ain't goin' back to her family, that's certain...not if she took off where the arrow points.
I am...I am...It's just that I know Martha'd want you to think of her boys as well as her girls...And if the girls are...dead...Ethan, don't let the boys waste their lives in vengeance!
You've seen her!...She's alive?
One letter in five years...I read it till the paper dried up and the writing faded out...
<U>Laurie</U>! Shut your mouth!
Sorry...  Keep the column moving!..Close ranks there!
Come on, say it.  You know...
They say it's fantastic.  At least that's what I read in a men's magazine.  So who are the two lucky ones?
Well then, I guess I'd better leave the two of you alone.  But don't forget...
Oh, damnit!
In the cellar, I think. Wait, I'll take care of it.
Yes, daddy.
Well, if you won't let me smoke grass, then at least I'll go get myself some cigarettes.
Hey, take your time.  You know time heals better than any shrink ever can.
We just have to make a new beginning.
Someone from the village.
Come on, this isn't about honesty. You just need a good night's sleep. The way you toss and turn all night, even I hardly get any sleep.
I haven't the slightest idea.
Old?!  Come look at this!  She has wounds.  Wounds on her head.  Like thrashes.  Or bites.
...So he's dictating you a new bestseller?  Whatever that is, it's not our son.
Oh no, no.  You're not bothering him.  He has lots of time since he's been retired.
I think I've killed him.  Martin, my husband, I've killed him!  That is, I'm not sure, but...
We should leave the past alone.
The speech is excellent.  "Oh, then I see Queen Mab hath been with you!" Excellent and a good length. But then he disappears for the length of a bible.
It's good.
The title won't do.
Romeo and Juliet--just a suggestion.
Yes.
My Massacre at Paris is complete.
Romeo?--he gave it to Henslowe.
Well, I am to Deptford now, I leave my respects, Miss Rosaline.
I am still owed money for this play, Burbage.
A comedy. All but done, a pirate comedy, wonderful.
Aye, now and again, but what of it? I have lost my gift.
On my mother's side the Ardens
The woman who wears the snake will dream of you, and your gift will return. Words will flow like a river. I will see you in a week.
Two weeks, three at the most, Aaaagh! For pity's sake.
And his ears.
What have I done, Mr. Fennyman?
I don't know. It's a mystery.
Oh, it's coming, it's coming.
it will be all right, madam.
She is always Aphrodite.
Cut out my heart! Throw my liver to the dogs!
To my weekly confession.
Yes. Nearly.  It's all locked safe in here. We need Ralph for the Pirate King. Good morning, Master Nol. You will have a nice little part.
I don't know, it's a mystery.
Go on.
Yes, that's good. Until he meets
"Is the day so young?"
Be still.
Oh, Nurse! He would give Thomas Kent the life of Viola De Lesseps's dreaming.
Your Majesty
And I love poetry above all.
Oh, but they can!
"Madam!"
I would have made you immortal.  Tell Burbage he has lost a new play by Will Shakespeare.
Sam! Do me a speech, do me a line.
I have night's cloak to hide me from their eyes; And but thou love me, let them find me here.
You have opened the playhouses?
Answer me only this: are you the author of the plays of William Shakespeare?
Then kiss me again for I am not mistook.
That's my line!
You lie.
"Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day> It was the nightingale and not the lark That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear. Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate tree. Believe me, love, it was the nightingale."
"I have more care to stay than will to go. Come death, and welcome. Juliet wills it so. How is't my soul? Let's talk. It is not day."
I am done with theatre. The playhouse is for dreamers. Look where the dream has brought us.
Orsino?good name
Nor you for me.
Lord Wessex. You have been waiting.
Virginia?!
The Queen has consented?
Lady Viola is?young in the world. Your Majesty is wise in it. Nature and truth are the very enemies of playacting. I'll wager my fortune.
My hat?
Are you Mr. Shakespeare?
Do you understand me?
It is, Thomas, but of good reputation. Come, there is no harm in a drink.
I'd like to ask you about your hobbies.
Just serve.
Victory is the same as defeat. It's giving in to destructive competitive urges.
I don't have time.
It's true. A newspaper is paying for all this. A newspaper...
But don't tell me that you're not tempted by it. Don't tell me that you're not interested. I know you well enough.
All right, then, go ahead, telephone. Telephone the police. Try again. No one's going to stand in your way. Go ahead. Tell them there's a suitcase of money and you don't want it.
Dig the pit, I don't know.
We all are, David, we're all going to do it. Each of us, you, me and Juliet, will do his or her bit. Is that fair enough?
I don't hear this.
You're telling me you want out? Already? You're telling me you don't want the money? Hugo is going off. He smells. The flat smells. We can't wait any longer.
But not quite.
Can we talk about something?
You think so?
I don't know.
I fitted a lock up there. On the inside.
Your friends.
Oh, no, no, no. Don't let it worry you. Not at all. It's probably for the best.
Yeah?
Where do you think you'll go?
I don't know.
Well, I've got this story, it's really good, I'm working on, that is good, I feel it could be big, it this, eh, and it's, you know, it's incredible. Am I right, did you say beyond recognition'?
This is just an informal discussion.
Well, then?
That's all?
Yes, thanks.
Yes.
Really?
I mean, what are you actually doing here? What is the hidden agenda?
What? Oh, yeah, sure, if you want. I tell you, every letter this guy writes to you is the same: they all begin like pure love and descend into open pornography. I dream of your thighs, the soft touch of your white skin leading me in desire, while I, aroused and inflamed --'
Alex.
What I am.
A miserable, burnt-out, empty shell of a -- Alex pauses, looks at his drink, then at Juliet.
You're right.
David?
Yes.
I'm just looking.
Old newspaper proverb says dead human being is living story. Be rational, please, and failing that be quiet.
What?
I want my money back. Excuse me.
It's not for me. It's for love and happiness forever.
No, I don't.
That's not him.
Who was it?
Then let's spend some money.
Yeah, you're making us all nervous.
He's right. You'd feel much better about it.
Because that's no good. Remember, we did what we did, we took the money. It was a material calculation. But what's the use if it's underground, or in some funny bank in some funny place? If you can't spend it, if you can't have it, what use is it? None. It's nothing, all for nothing, if you do that. I didn't get into this for nothing, so that I could have nothing --
He can't stay up there.
David?
Oh, good.
It's the only way.
Everything.
Alex.
We were just sorting things out.
No.
Let him go. Let him take it all.
What?
You mean I can have the room?
What about?
Yes. Why do you think you woke and they didn't?
Did you ever kill a man?
No.
You paid two hundred pounds for this?
Well, it's a wide range of, eh --
Eh --
I'm not sure --
That one, last week.
Yeah, here, I mean, where else?
The telephone? It continues to ring.
No.
A certain weakness.
The first one was fine.
I'm sorry, I've never seen any of them.
Excellent. DC Mitchell is a rising star, Mr. Stevens. Under my tutelage he will undoubtedly make the grade.
She's a very groovy girl. That's the problem.
Who?
Maybe... why do you ask?
I don't know. He's a hairdresser.
It's just -- fabulous.  Think you could do anything for me?
What do you expect me to do about it?
-- what, who? Oh she's very nice, yes -- I mean normally ---
That's okay too.
Yes and you don't have to be sarcastic about it, that's a beautiful thing he's doing -- some people do more than go to the beauty parlor and shop at Saks --
Calm down, baby.
-- What?
Jesus, I don't know, baby, I been cutting too much hair lately. I'm losing all my concepts...
What about?
Yes.
And I certainly wouldn't tell Lester.
Well she...
She's a friend of Jill's.
Holy Christ. You want to get us killed?
Let it ring.
Hello.
In fact, I don't think I've ever been to a beauty parlor in my whole life.
I am not like my mother!
Well, yeah... you know.
Yeah.
I've got heads here, Norman.
Somebody's going to have to wash Mrs. Young. Mary's not here.
Great. Who's been doing your hair?
-- Yeah... your car down here?
-- Maybe she'll come with us. If I tell her how important it is to me, I don't think she'll mind. Do you?
No, I'm sure.
Whew.
That son of a bitch, everything he says is a phony piece of shit, what does he think, I'm some cigar butt he's got between his teeth --
Jackie, can we --
No you didn't.
You were great.
Sammy's?
We're friends.
-- do you want ice?
That's it, then I'm leaving.
No, man.
What?
If I have to touch her again, I'll throw up!
-- oh -- sweetheart...
-- why did you come in today?
-- yeah, this is --
What're you talking about?
What?
Great.
Egypt!
I'll call you.
I'll call you.
Who?
A business meeting, I told you that.
Look at the way I live.
Maybe I should get a dog... no, it would just shit all over the house and I'd never clean it up.
-- she's a very compulsive girl.
Well, did you get a job out of it at least?
Where did this come from?
How many?
I just want to know, that's all.
I don't want to be a fool!... I want to look them in the eye and say, I know!
-- it'll help me if you'll tell me.
That's all you've got to say?
Did you?
What did you say?
-- A wash and set.
But Mr. Norman said --
I see.
I'm better than the guy I work for.
Thank you.
Okay.
That's okay, that's okay, just shut the door.
What about, tonight?
It's nerve wracking sometimes... women can get you very upset.
Oh, hey...
I don't know what to...
-- yeah?
Layered?
Look, Lester... are you unhappy with me about something?
But...
Oh yeah...
What about her?
Lester, it just happened.
Then you were talking to him.
That's not very logical, Lester.
Lester, this is my friend Jill and this is Johnny Pope.
Oh yeah?
See you later.
I guess not.
-- No. No really.
I'm exaggerating.
Honey?
-- When you say forty-five minutes or an hour, do you mean continuous time? Just continually, without stopping?
Didn't you have any panties on?
What did you do?
That's right.
Getting your hair done...  Would you like to go to a party?
I don't think so.
-- oh I don't know --
-- these bastards have me hemmed in.
Those Arabs won't be when they start chasing you around the sand dunes.
-- just before I ask you out? I can't do that. Let's get out of here before good old Les catches up with us again.
No... how long did you say?
Dad?
No, Dad.
I'm not supposed to.
How does he tell you things?
Do you really want to go and live in that hotel for the winter?
Okay.
Red Rum.  Red Rum.  Red Rum.
Danny!
Mrs. Torrance, most of the time these episodes with kids are never explained.  They are brought on by emotional factors, and they rarely occur again.
Why no, sir.  I don't believe so.
And, er... where are they now?
He is, Mr. Torrance.
A nigger.
Your son has a very great talent. I don't think you are aware how great it is, but he is attempting to use that very talent against your will.
Will you indeed, Mr. Torrance.
Your wife appears to be stronger than we imagined, Mr. Torrance. Somewhat more resourceful, she seems to have got the better of you.
There's nothing I look forward to with the greater pleasure, Mr. Grady.
Sir, I've been trying to make an urgent phone call up there,
It will be a pleasure.  Right this way Mrs. Torrance.
Nice to meet you.
I'm a Wendy.
I wouldn't know what to do with it if I did.
Pleased to meet you.
It's good to be back, Lloyd.
It's not a matter that concerns you, Mr. Torrance - at least not at this point.
God, I've never seen anything like this before.  Are all of these Indian designs authentic?
I guess we've been staying up too late.
I love it.  I really do.  I've never been this happy, or comfortable anywhere.
Okay.  I understand.  I'll come back later on with a couple of sandwiches for you and... maybe you'll let me read something then.
Yes, I did.
Jack...
How do you like it?
Darling, light of my life, I'm not going to hurt you.  You didn't let me finish my sentence.  I said 'I'm not going to hurt you... I'm just going to bash your brains in!'  I'm going to bash them right the fuck in.
Wendy...
Well, that just happens to be exactly what I'm looking for.  I'm eh... I'm outlining a new writing project, and eh... 
Well, my predecessor in this job
Oh, it's beautiful.  My God, this place is fantastic, isn't it hon?
Oh!
Thank you, Susie.
Just like a ghost ship, huh?
Eight thirty.
Come on, Jane- it was Brady's idea. I couldn't stop him.
Don't tell me what I have to do and what I don't, booger-brains.
All except my legs... I don't think I can walk.
It's just an outward symbol of everything that's inwardly wrong in this town. Not bad, huh? I read Sherwood Anderson in college. I can jive that shit all day.
What?
Do I need one?
Yeah, I know. It's great!
What the hell does that matter?
Dear boy, you have gone right out of your mind.
Yeah. Really. The bitch of it is, we still are. Learn from your elders, dearies.
We won't!
Perhaps.
Really?
Yeah, you learned a whole lot, I can tell.
You know what we're saying!
SING!
Just tell him, I do love you, but I can't -- I'm a nun.
Mary Robert, don't panic.  Remember what we talked about?  Experience?
What did who say?
Vince...
You lying sleazeball!  The best years of my life!  What am I, garbage?  Am I lint?
And to say you're sorry.  About this afternoon.  And the things you said. Forgotten.  Completely.  Do you understand?  Forgotten.
What is it, Betty?
Yes, Betty?
D00-LANG, DOO-LANG, D00-LANG.
Get moving.  I'm right behind you.
Were you wicked?
Enough jabber.
Progressive convents.  Vanity.  It sounds awful.  It sounds just like this place.
Whatever.
Mary Robert.
I knew that.
Tell me about it.
Right, right, cross with the left, spin and turn!
What?
Well... see, at my old convent, I wasn't always... real popular.  I was sort of selfish and... not real helpful.  Okay, I'll say it -- I wasn't much of a nun. But now, thanks to all of you... maybe I'm shaping up.
Sing!
Mary Robert.  I'm... Mary Robert.
A novice.
Right, sure, but what's the problem? Are they keeping you a prisoner here? Do they drug you?  Did Reverend Mother like, kidnap your parents?  We can call the Enquirer.
Initiation.  You understand.  Later on, we make her wear her underwear on her head.
They're from my old convent.
Bless you.
What did He say?
What is your full name?  Your Christian name?
Are you talking about me?
Before we do, you might like to freshen up.  And you'll certainly want to change
My what?
Useless distractions.
From all I've heard, just about everything.  Your singing career seems all but nonexistent, and your married lover wants you dead. 
Come, Sister.
Have you been out in those streets?  Do you know what those kids are up against? You should help them!
Out of the question.
Indeed.  After how long?  A few weeks? I have been here thirty years.  And yet, it would seem, I know nothing.
A part of what?  Mary Clarence, it is one thing to rabble rouse, to sweep into town and declare a holiday.  You have raised the Sisters' expectations, you have excited and confused them.  They imagine this neighborhood to be some sort of delightful ongoing block party.
Don't push it.
Yeah, like what?  Quilted coat hangers, that your mother picked out?  Lottery tickets?  A travel iron?
Get a stenographer.
What're you gonna do, put me in a bag and bury me?
But it's a nightmare!  Mother Superior is out to get me!  She hates my guts! She keeps thinking up new kinds of torture!
You blew it -- big time.  She doesn't want you back.
She's counting on it.  She's concerned for your safety, but she wants me to try and find another convent that will take you. Or a carnival.
What if I was Vince?  You'd be dead right now.  What are you doing giving interviews on TV?
You're supposed to be hiding out!
I've been worried about you.
No.  Most of the time I'm thinking about you.  And now... you've really changed.
Really.
You won't even tell us?
Take care of it.
Forget her!  We got the one we need! Step on it!
She's praying.
Is it worth it?  A lot of witnesses here.
We're losing it.
That should have tipped us.
We can't leave it up to the Feds!
Reverend Mother, on behalf of the sisters, I'd like to welcome Mary Clarence to St. Katherine's.
Really...
Really, Mary Clarence?  Were you a choirmistress?
It's no use.  She just isn't here.
And what a lovely name.  Las Vegas...
We can save this young woman's life, and imprison a parasite -- all in one gesture.
Your small convent is in danger of closing, Reverend Mother.  The Las Vegas Police Department has offered to make a generous financial donation.
Many have.
I cannot proceed without examining the previous victims.
Are you a deist?  Is that it?  A free thinker who does not believe in divinity.
Damn you, sir!  God damn you to hell!
Hmm?  See them?
He drowned.  Anyone could see.
I could determine if he were dead <u>before</u> he went into the Hudson.
Is that all you say?  Look at her.
And now Jonathan Masbath.
Yes... I suppose it is.  Keep it.
Listen.
Should we go back?
"Let loose his silent shrieking." Who knows, till we work at it?  I admit not being anxious to find out.  "He who holds the Horseman's desire will guide his reaping hand." Whatever the Horseman's desire is, other than extinguishing lives.
Good questions, deserving answers, of which we are in short supply.
We should go.
Man or woman?
Because, I serve a fine purpose alive. It is perfection for our murderer if I return to New York City with nothing more than tales of a galloping ghoul.  We must uncover the reason these victims were targeted.  What was taken from them... other than their lives? Who benefits by their deaths?
To discover what might have been taken from those who died, it will help to know what was there that could be taken in the first place.
Baltus Van Tassel.
Yes.  I rode with him on payment days.
Something I really wish I had not seen. Never mind it.  Did you find the victims' loan agreements?
Fiction plays and novels.  Baltus does not approve.  Now, come.  It may not be long before Lady Van Tassel returns.
Do you often make a habit of sitting on strange men's beds?
You made this, and the drawings?
If you want.  But...
I insist that you have it.
That would be a pity.  Those words might show you something you've never seen before.
It was not butchery.
Katrina.  Why do you follow?
A woman should not be out alone in these woods.
It was you there?
The loans give the land to your father. It does not matter survivors are still on their farms.  They could be thrown off... tomorrow... a year from now.
What would you have me believe?
Speak the words, Constable.  What is stopping you?  What has happened to your ability to transcend sentimentality?
He moves too fast.
No.  Get to the crest of the roof and be ready to jump.
It is a prime tenet of science, Philipse, that because one thing appears improbable does not mean you embrace the utterly fantastical.
You want to see into the nether world... I can show you.  Whatever you see, do not move or speak.  I will hold him.
Am I?  Or, are you and Young Masbath dead along with me?
No one will believe your lies, whore.
No.
If it works out and all, maybe we'll get you a key so you can get out at night if you need to. See you later.
He's a regular whiz at it. That's all he did when he was a kid.
Well, I've got a roomful of work for him to do. Can't get Scooter to do any of it.
How are you, Bill?
Is him stayin' here workin' out?
French-fried potaters.
Karl's my name.
Don't say nothin' about that boy.
Ain't that the sweetest thing. What am I supposed to do about supper with you traipsin' around with that fag?
Please Doyle, don't.
No Doyle. Vaughan don't want to come to a party with you.
Karl, you better clap your hands or he'll just keep on.
Don't tell me what to do.
Don't tell me what to do.
It went real good.
Yeah, honey, let the kid watch T.V. Hell, let's all watch T.V. like a family till your retarded friend and your homosexual friend gets here.
Goddamnit, I'm talkin' to the man. You set right there, Karl.
Karl can stay if he wants to. Mama said --
I know Albert. We're friends.
Come on, don't be a pussy. Everybody has to work.
Shhhh! This is the national anthem.
Frank, I just like you as a friend. Only at the secret place. Okay? I can't go there now. I'll see you later.
Yeah it is. Your name's Frank.
You told me to come by.
I growed up and got taught it ain't right to kill nobody.
You ort not to talk that way. You're just a boy.
I like the way you talk.
Yeah.
Yeah, I reckon they did. Hit like to tore me up when I read about that pore little cripple boy.
Hit was right thoughty of her.
I bet he will. I got a little money if he don't. I'll get 'em for ye.
Naw.
Pull on your works. Your privates.
I don't reckon I know.
I had one there for little bit. Hit didn't get old enough to play with.
I didn't feel right about doin' that. I takened a shoe box from there in the shed and emptied out some screwdrivers and nuts and warshers from it and put the little feller in that and buried him in the corner of the yard there. That seemed more proper to me, I reckon.
You will? For sure?
I'm glad of it you was borned.  I reckon I ain't gonna be there in the garage no more.
That feller's a whole sight meaner than me. He'd just whup the tar out of me.
I'm tired, too, Frank.  If I ain't around no more, it don't mean I don't care fer ye. I care for ye a good deal. I care for you more than anybody they is. We made friends right off the bat.
I've got a feelin' today.
Like something different. I don't know.  You're leavin' ain't you, Karl?
They ain't even no good. The only one can play is Randy Horsefeathers. He claims he's an Indian. His real name's Randy Collins and he works at the feed mill. He can at least play guitar.
I'm fine, honey. Let's just try and forget about tonight.
Well, when you like pricing items as much as I do, I guess it's just bound to happen sooner or later.
I reckon.
I told you, I ain't got no boy, now get on out from here and let me be.
I reckon I don't care nothin' about bein' a free man. I don't know how to go about it.
I reckon.
He's a-carryin' me to look fer work in Millsburg where I was borned.
Tolerable, I reckon.
I'll be dog.
That's okay. It's not really my business. I have wondered though. Why was it? Was it like a nervous breakdown?
I could shore use some. Thank ye.
No ma'am. I'm a'goin' off sommers.
He wanted to go off and play, I reckon.  You go in there and you and that Doyle eat ye dinner. You don't have to worry yourself none.
You've been real good to me, too. It ain't ever'body that'd make biscuits in the middle of the night. You and that boy has give me a good feelin'.
What's that you say?
They turned me loose from the state hospital.
I reckon Mr. Woolridge got me hired on to work for Bill Cox's outfit.
Not really to speak of.
So, you're really going to stay here?
I mean tomorrow or the next day.
I don't reckon you have to go with women to be a daddy to a boy.  You've been real square dealin' with me. The Bible says two men ort not lay together. But I'll bet you the Good Lord wouldn't send nobody like you to Hades. Some folks calls it Hell, I call it Hades.  That boy lives inside of his own heart. Hits an awful big place. You take care of that boy.
Frank's just crazy about him. He likes the way he talks. He helped him carry home the clean laundry.
No, we have to get this story.
Well, yeah, it's for the school newspaper. But it has pictures. I mean it's a regular paper, you know.
Signs?
Wherever he wants to. I think he's going back to Millsburg where he's from. It's just about twenty miles from here.
Three's a crowd. Yes, I'm aware of that. But I have to keep an eye on Mr. Benjamin wherever he goes. To make sure he doesn't get himself into trouble.
I confess.
Muncie, Indiana. He and my mother met as students. But I'm from Brooklyn. My sisters and I were all born and bred right here.
American literature. What else?
Visions of Utopia in Nineteenth-Century American Fiction.
What's that, Sol?
Uh, sure, Sol. Anything you say. Instead of saying, "One corned beef sandwich," and then, "Another corned beef sandwich," I'll say, "Two corned beef sandwiches."
I wouldn't think of it.  See you around, fellas.
No problem. It's not as though I'm rushing off to the opera or anything.
Yeah, I did.
It's mine all right. I've owned that little sucker for a long time.
Well, let's not exaggerate. I take pictures. You line up what you want in the viewfinder and click the shutter. No need to mess around with all that artisto crap.
They're all the same, but each one is different from every other one. You've got your bright mornings and your dark mornings. You've got your summer light and your autumn light. You've got your weekdays and your weekends. You've got your people in overcoats and galoshes, and you've got your people in shorts and T-shirts. Sometimes the same people, sometimes different ones. And sometimes the different ones become the same, and the same ones disappear. The earth revolves around the sun, and every day the light from the sun hits the earth at a different angle.
Fuckus my assus. They did some number on you.
Nothing much. He said his socks and underpants were dirty, and would we mind driving up with his things.  Fucking kids, huh? They take you for granted every time.
Hi, Auggie.
Uh, better make it one.
Christmas stories? Sure, I know a ton of 'em.
Ready. Any time you are.
I lied to her, and then I stole from her. I don't see how you can call that a good deed.
I've got something to talk to you about, and the least you can do is listen. You owe me that much. I drove all the way from Pittsburgh to see you, and I'm not going until you've heard me out.
It means "happiness."
Why would I lie to you, Auggie? You think it was easy to come here and walk into this place? Why would I do it if I didn't have to?
It was over with Bill before you ever came home. Maybe you don't remember it now, but you were pretty hot to see me back then.
Then why do you think I married Frank? I was already pregnant, and I didn't have much time. Say what you like, but at least he gave my kid a name.
You what?
Yeah, like what?
And what's that supposed to mean?
Cut it out. Just cut it out, okay? It's starting to get on my nerves.
You told me you wanted to meet him. Well,here he is.
I'd never be able to talk her into it. And even if I could, those things cost money. And that's just what I don't have. I'm flat out dead broke.
It's the law that's buying. That's what's so beautiful about it. I mean, when was the last time you heard of a judge sending himself to jail?
And why the hell would you give me money?
Huh?
And these?
The refrigerator?
Thanks for the tip.
How the hell did you get into the building?
And his parents?
Do you want something to drink? A beer? A glass of water?
I don't know. I haven't decided yet.
It'll cost you five bucks.
What's your offer?
You know, health insurance, dental plan, paid vacation. It's not fun being exploited. Workers have to stand up for their rights.
I don't know. I try. Every day I keep on trying, but it's no easy task for a man to change his nature.  I'm off the booze, though. Haven't had a drop in six years. And now I've got me a wife. Doreen. Best damned woman I've ever known.  And a little boy, too. Cyrus Junior.  So things have definitely improved since I got fitted with this hook. If I can just turn this goddamn garage around, I'll be in pretty good shape.
That boy's one in a million. A real tiger.
And this one, in case you haven't guessed, is Junior.
Well what?
Baby? And what baby is that?
Yeah, well, there ain't no baby in there now. You dig? There's nothing in there now.
An abortion, stupid.  I had an abortion the day before yesterday. So you don't have to bug me about that shit anymore.  Bye-bye, baby!
Yeah? And why is that?
I can't believe I did that ... Christ. I'm walking around in a fog ...
I owe you something.
That's okay. I've already had lunch.
You don't have to tell me if you don't want to, but I might be able to help.
You can't be more specific than that?
Suit yourself. But if you change your mind, here's the address. 
Same here. But I had a long talk with my accountant this afternoon. You know, to see how a move like this would affect my tax picture, and he said it would be okay.
He's dead?
Drawing's a good thing.
Yeah, sometimes.  I like to dabble, too.
I'm sorry. They just... they just slipped out of my hands.
Take good care of yourself, okay?
I wanted to give you this as a token of my appreciation.
I don't have much time. 
What time did you get to bed last night?
Come on, just a little hint.
It's my birthday. I'm seventeen years old  as of forty-seven minutes ago, and I think I should celebrate having made it this far.
I just did.
Not exactly. I mean, there was more to it than I told you.
I pay Auggie, and I've got nothing. Eight hundred bucks and a ticket to Shit City.
Wow. They sure did a job on you.
Now ask him who his mother was.
Everything is real in here, honey.  As real as the color of my hair.
What are you sellin' 'em for? Why don't we start there.
Well, if the blood got <u>onto</u> the gaff by crushing a man's skull...
So the defendant knew the deceased, your son, even then.
Tried to.  Defaulted on their payments.
All right, what if the defendant <u>heard</u>?  So Carl <u>let</u> him aboard, to help.  And <u>then</u> the fishing gaff?
Well, what if?
Why not?
Why?  We're only talking.
Well, I don't do it for just anybody.
Look at my face.  It's the face of the people who did that.  My father hardly speaks English.  We're in bad trouble, you have to see that.
I don't mean everyone.  Just people who can do things because they can arrest people or convict them.  Or run a newspaper.
Seattle boys think he's guilty.  They say the evidence is rock solid.
He didn't want to lose any more.
That's how journalists.  Answer questions.
No, sir, I can't.  Not beyond a reasonable doubt.
Oh, yeh.  But this is nine year ago, I had my healt, I wasn't wantin' to sell.
But even <u>after</u> you had an attorney.  You still claimed to know <u>nothing</u>.  Claimed <u>not</u> to have seen Carl. Am I correct?
I have told the truth.
Some seaman's loast report. Stuffed in a cabinet, good as lost forever.  No one knows.
Won't take two.
Don't prove there was two lanterns. Coulda been the one in the cabin.
No, you don't.
You're wondering why I held it.
Still lashed to the mast.
Just as the freighter comes through? Isn't that quite a coincidence?
Maybe...?
But you <u>could</u> be wrong.  He <u>could</u> have climbed up earlier.
The sheriff and the deputy and I inspected the deck closely.  We found a small fracture in the wood of the gunnel.  Just below the mast.
I'll take two.  One for later.
You ever been strangled by a single hand?
Look, no way I'm lettin' you out there.  In a half hour you could be in Canada.
Your daddy played.  I asked, down at the Japanese Community Center. You smoke cigars?
You won't hear that from Hooks. Because the charge is <u>first</u>-degree murder, which requires premeditation. He can't change the charge.
A little.  Yes.  You have to wonder.
It is.
Now you've testified that the deceased was a heavy man, and hard to bring out of the net.
If the head was moving fast enough, but I don't see how it could be.
I already said that, b...
Carl never lied.
I can't speak for him.
Carl said he didn't like Kabuo much anymore.
I suppose you want a tip?
Aren't you a little too young for that, sonny?
Bull fiddle.
Beat it, Buster.

Stop, or I'll burst out crying.
Like I was telling you - Little Bonaparte is getting soft.  He doesn't have it here any more.  Used to be like a rock.  Too bad.  I think it's time for him to retire.
I'll say.
Yeah.  Why?
What are you worried about?  This job is going to last a long time.
Shut up, will you?  I wonder how much Sam the Bookie will give up for our overcoats?
I told you - it's a sure thing.
Look, stupid, he's ten to one.  Tomorrow, we'll have twenty overcoats!
Yeah, that's what he means. Good old Nellie!  I ought to wring her neck!
What are you afraid of?  Nobody's asking you to have a baby.  This is just to get out of town. The minute we hit Florida, we'll blow this set-up.
Now you've done it!
You better come help me.
Now you tore the other one.
Polish?
Boy, would I like to borrow a cup of that Sugar.
Fight it.
You wouldn't hit a girl, would you?
All right, all right!  But how long can we keep this up?
I watched you two on the bus - lovey-dovey - whispering and giggling and borrowing each other's lipstick -
Yes - you have to be very careful about picking a roommate.
Daphne -  Go on - tell me all about him.
He's going to be ashore with you.
That's right.
Don't give me the musketeers!  How'm I going to keep the guy ashore?
Have I got things to tell you!
Osgood proposed to me.  We're planning a June wedding.
His mother - we need her approval.  But I'm not worried - because I don't smoke.
But Joe - this may be my last chance to marry a millionaire!
Daphne got a proposal tonight.
There's our shaving stuff - and there's Sugar.
Get me Room 414.
Terribly sorry.
Interesting.
That's ridiculous.
Isn't that ridiculous?
You got some?
Half-full.
What's the surprise?
Will she be surprised. I just can't wait to see her face -
I hope so.
Of course not.  As a matter of fact, it was just the other way around.  You see he needs help.
He's going to South America to marry some other girl - that's what they call high finance.
This is our manager, Mr. Bienstock. I'm Sweet Sue.
Oh - here and there - and around.
You're the wrong shape.  Goodbye.
- and you got to be girls.
Wait a minute, Joe.  Lets talk this over.  Why couldn't we do it?  Last year, when we played in that gypsy tearoom, we wore gold earrings.  And you remember when you booked us with that Hawaiian band?  Grass skirts!
Thank you.  Aren't you a sweetheart?
Personally, I'm Type O.
Bull fiddle.
Most of the time I slap it.
Why?
And I have a terrible past.  For three years now, I've been living with a saxophone player.
We won't breathe a word.
Oh, it's you!  You got a lot of nerve -
You need a bass and a sax, don't you?
It's not the backs that worry me.
You two from the Poliakoff Agency?
Oh.
That's what I'm running away from. I worked with six different ones in the last two years.  Oh, brother!
That's why I joined this band. Safety first.  Anything to get away from those bums.
Then one morning you wake up and the saxophone is gone and the guy is gone, and all that's left behind is a pair of old socks and a tube of toothpaste, all squeezed out.
Glasses?
Bienstock.  He snores to beat the band. We cut cards to see who sleeps over him, and I always lose.  Wouldn't you know?
My fault.
Well, I'm not.
Up, up, up.
For your own amusement?
Oh.  Well, I guess some like it hot.  But personally, I prefer classical music.
- Inauguration balls -
- riding to hounds -
It's been delightful meeting you both.
Maybe you'd better go after him - if you don't want to lose him.
Well, you know how those millionaires are.  These came for you.
Oh, Josephine - just imagine - me, Sugar Kowalczyk, from Sandusky, Ohio, on a millionaire's yacht.  If my mother could only see me now -
It's not how long you wait - it's who you're waiting for.
Just regulation size.  We have three like this.
Trophies.  You know - skeet-shooing, dog-breeding, water polo...
Yea, of course.  Now where could they have put it?  On Thursdays, I'm sort of lost around here.
They just sort of leave me cold.
How can you think about food at a time like this?
Eight hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
Me?
I'm afraid not.  I can't make it tonight.
According to our tax advisers, she's only so-so.  But - that's the way the oil gushes. A man in my position has a certain responsibility to the stockholders - all those little people who invest their life savings -
But you have.  You've given me all that inside information - first thing tomorrow I'm going to call my broker and have him buy fifty thousand shares of Venezuelan oil.
You and who else?
I come to Grandma's funeral.  Here's your admission card.
Goodbye, Charlie.
What for?
You don't owe me no nothing.
There's finally a reason for the whole world to revolve around you?
Bacardi 151.
Pub Golf?
Sure, disappear. We've been walking away our whole lives.
Yeah. Most important day of my life. Whatever. Listen, I chose you to be my Maid of Honor for a lot of reasons: I love you, you're my favorite, and only, half-sister, blah blah blah. But the main reason I picked you is because you've been so miserable for the past few years, I knew you wouldn't outshine me.  But here it is, my big day. My big day. And something doesn't feel right. Maybe it was that pep talk you gave me last night, I don't know, but your misery just isn't working for me anymore.
Why, with you.
I'm sure General Eisenhower never had to master the finer points of the seating chart and centerpieces.  Oh, and tomorrow afternoon you are carpooling to the country with the Fletcher-Wootens.
She did?
I'm a hooker.
What?
But, somehow, it was Kat's arse that was stung by nettles. And you rubbed it with a dandelion leaf.
What?
No, tell me.
Let me guess. Amy presumed I'd forget the rings.  I think I'm her least favorite person.  You know, I am sorry.
I have regrets.
Seven if you count the on-and-off years. Which I do.
I slept with your sister.
Kat.
Why?
It's okay. Hell, I've never paid for it. But please don't feel like you have to explain yourself to me.
I think that's disgusting.
Shampoo, got it!
I have a different story for every woman who asks. I look at her and figure out what she needs to hear to feel okay about being with me.
Admit it. You were disturbed, but ultimately moved.
My sixth-grade science project was entitled, ?Love Hurts: The Heartbreak of Human Papillomavirus.? Trust me, I'm careful.
This is awkward for me.  Talking about it makes me feel better.
I've got this bad taste in my mouth. What is it? I think it's the words: ?morally repugnant.?
Not if you take an advance on your credit card.
Not dollars. Pounds.
Sure, but it's never easy. They say they're okay with it, and they are...for a while. Then one day, they're not.
Yeah.
Go ahead, Kat. Hate me. You were running out of steam on the whole Jeffrey thing. Maybe now you'll be able to hold onto this just long enough to ruin your next relationship.
Yes? No. What?  Save the patter for the tourists.
It's complicated, Dad.
You don't live around here, do you?
Thank you, Miss Johnson.
I try...
That's where we come from first?
No, Miss Johnson...
:The night in the woods with his father and SOUNDER. The shouting and laughter after the baseball game --
:HE, JOSIE and EARL, running and playing in the field.
Charlie, just because a man and his family are colored, you--
I did look, Charlie, but I--
Charlie, you have no legal right not to let this boy know where his father is! You hear that, you and this whole damn court house; what you are doing is wrong!
It was too dark, Daddy.
We goin' huntin' again tomorrow ?
"You lose some of the time, what you always go afta, but you lose all the time what you don't go afta!"
They is!? It shore is good to see you, boy!
We goin' huntin' again, Daddy !?
I cleaned and oiled all your stuff while you was gone...
Goodnight to you, son...
Yes, Daddy! Yes!
Nathan Lee Morgan...
Gotta wait 'til visitin' days.
Never heard of 'im. We gotta lotta men here...
Yes, David...
David!
Then why don't he holler like he usta?
I don't look like no possum!
Nobody yet -- it's all tied up.
You sure can, son...
I can do it, Mama -- you know that. In the Bible stories you read to us, everybody's always goin' on a long journey. Jacob goes into a strange land where his uncle is and he don't even know where he lives, but he finds him. Everybody finds what they supposed to find.
Miss Johnson must be a real kindly lady.
Thank you, Miss Boatwright.
If I tell you I didn't, David, that's what I mean.
Any time it's Saturday and I don't hafta do any work, I'm doin' okay!
I need some nutmeg, flour, eggs, sugar, and...
And don't wake up Josie Mae and Earl!
Little chilly.
Well, let's get to it, Miss Rebecca,'cause I been waitin' too long a time for your good cookin'!
To the commissary to get this boy some clothes! I'm gon' get everybody somethin'!
I wanta see Nathan.
I got to see my husband, Sheriff Young!
Behold my glory.
Can I finish? Hello? Can I finish? ...The United States has graphic images of violence on television all the time, what is that one show? COPS? And car crashes caught on tape? We can't believe that a movie with some foul language and fart jokes would piss you off so much.
Can I finish? Please? Can I finish? ... ... Uh... Okay, I'm finished.
My head hurts.
Doggy.
Montana.
Fragile?
Eric!
They're burning all the Canadian stuff cause of the war.
Cuz, dummy they're Canadian, just like Ike!
You bet your fucking ass it was!
Yeah,  <b>Shut your fucking face, Unclefucka!!</b>
Come on, Cartman. It's not your fault.
No you guys... Something happened... You guys wanna hear something creepy?  I don't think Kenny is dead.
Whoops.
Mom... When is the war gonna be over?
I saw him!! I saw Kenny!!
Mkay, kids from all over the State have been brought here, because you all share the same problem. Uh, young man... Let's start with you.
Eric, that is not appropriate.
Norwegian Ass Raper.
The rest of you are graduated. You can go home today.
This is it! The time for action is NOW!!  <b>Something must be done! This is like a spreading rash! They're pulling out our children's brains and filling them with trash! Can't you see what this is leading to? A world of smut and sex and poo! I believe the good fight has begun! Something must be done!</b>
A hunger strike? For what?
It's that v-chip thing that's inside you, Eric!  The polarity must have been reversed by the electric chair!
Oh that's easy, you just gotta find the clitoris.
No, what does that mean, find the clitoris?
It's... It's not good children.
Mph rm. Rmph rm rmph rm.
Then move out of the way.
I wouldn't bullshit you kid! Snacky Smores are now available in stores everywhere! No biggie!
Aw, ma!!
KYLE BROVLOFSKI, YOU WATCH YOUR LANGUAGE!!
Yeah, I guess.
No. Zey must have zem inside. We will have to dig.
Time? Did time matter to the Revolutionists who were forced to eat their own shit while dying in the dungeons of ze King?
Sheet.  Did you bring ze mirror?
For pooping, silly.
Careful? Was my mother careful when she stabbed me in the heart with a clothes hanger while I was still in ze womb?
Aw, God Damn it, he's singing that fucking song again.
I'VE heard them from Mr. Garrison a few times before...
I thought she wasn't your girlfriend, dude.
I bet she would if my name was GREGORY!!
Wow!
No, dude, all you have to do is hit the keys really fast and say a bunch of stupid shit and it works.
Me?!
Yeah, so what if you say uncle raper or dicksucker or, or-
We're going to find our boys! For God's sake Sheila, you almost had them killed!!
-Or monkey fucker-
Right away, ma'am!
Well, it looks like I'll have to send a warning letter out to parents. I have to put a stop to this before MORE children see 'Terrance and Phillip'.
Ooh yes. I think we'll have to give detention to those boys.
Very encouraging. Most of the children have been weened from their naughty mouths.
YOU'D fuck your uncle!
Cheers, Terrance!
You did? Just now?
You remember... Saddam Hussein, don't you?!
I know.
You don't care.
Relax bitch!  You're better seen, not hear okay?
THAT'S IT!  I HAVE HAD ENOUGH!!!!
That's nice, Stan.
Wow, I have a clitoris too.
Cool!
And the butfor?
I'll tell you what I'm going to do.
Anna...
Anna Koros. She sensually extends her hand, Warren shakes it -
Magnificent, magnificent.
So, what brings you out here?  Pleasure cruise?
They are awaiting further information.
My...wings...
And I intend to correct that at once. I'll tell you something Mac...
Well, maybe I will.  You sure you don't want anything?
Well, maybe I'll surprise you.
That's very professional sounding of you, Taylor.
Why yes Ryan, I am, and thanks for asking.  You don't have to talk to the intercom, I can hear you fine.
Seems like they're cooperating. Hopefully I'll be out of here and on my way very soon.
Cool your jets...I'm doing a little damage control.
This is a major screw up on your part, goddamn it!
That's clear.
Yes.  Theoretical discoveries aside, there's nothing like the real thing. How about you?
Well I hope I don't do anything careless.
Just considering our options... sir.
Suppose you didn't have to hold your breath?
You're right.
Close every door behind you!
Yeah, let's hope he can find a way through.
Even if we do, it might be too late.
At this point I'm ready for anything.
Yeah, but you didn't answer my question.
Words to live by.
And so far.
I don't know.  Wave to them!
Is there anything I can help you with?
Well if you need anything, please feel free to ask me.  Just a reminder we have fabulous cuisine available 24 hours in the earthrise room, and a large selection of vintage wines here in our ship bar.
I'll tell you what you're gonna do.  You're gonna stay put like Taylor said.
Mac.  What's shaking?
That will not be necessary.  You can simply speak to me.  I understand most languages fluently.
One moment please...  one moment please...
I'm sorry.  The suit compartments are in a non-oxygenated, zero gravity atmosphere.  I'm afraid that's off limits to all passengers.
That's affirmative.
The pin machine?
Orange who? Not from 'round here, are ya?
It belonged to my dad.
So Buzz, let's skedaddle. Mr. Kastle is waiting. As Buzz gets up, Theo rises and steps between his father and the two sleazeballs.
Is it true they blacked out the whole county giving you electro-shock? Junior looks from one man to the other, breathing heavily, his nostrils flaring.
Kastle's daughter's been lookin' for you.
I'd buy it!
A beautiful thing. And you know why Buzz? You know what we got? Buzz raises an eyebrow as he buttons his shirt.
That game was before you was born.
Thanks.
kissed a lotta tadpoles.  Listen, I been thinking about your problem. I'm not the guy to sponsor you. It would be unethical. But, there is something I could do for you.  Putt-putt golf.
Not for me. Miniature golf's for pansies.
What's it look like to you?
I'm your blood.
You got a better offer?
That's right, Buzz, and you know when I did it? Last match, last frame. All I needed was one spare for the crown - and I get stuck with the seven-ten, the Fazeli Split.
I was beaten on a shot named after my own dad. The moment passes. Theo turns and climbs into his car. He looks up at Buzz.
I told you to get lost. You forced yourself into this mess, so the mess accommodated you. Buzz straightens out and carefully remolds the bent out of shape halo.
Bowlers don't go around killing other bowlers. He's only a fan, Millie. I'll give him some tips and an autograph and he's outta here.
Millie, please.  I don't have a son. I think you better leave now young man. Buzz gestures towards the front door.
It feels good to let it out, doesn't it? Sheila leans over and whispers furiously to her father.
Nobody touches her. Except me. I touch her. Sheila told me you played bouncy- bouncy with her.
Junior who?
Needs lubrication. Lubrication.
Someone wants to play with me?
If I find out Buzz is comin' up short on dwarf bowling, it's lights out for him and pink slips for you. Sid and Breeze look sideways at each other.
You know who I am?
I heard you've been having a little trouble with the Congress.  Theo pulls his eyes off Sheila. Kastle walks Theo past pairs of bowlers.
It's nothing, just a slight business imbalance.  How's Gloria's thumb?
I like the sport the way it is.
I think Buzz is retiring soon. In fact, I think he's retiring tonight. Kastle pulls out a shiny gold credit card and holds it in front of Sheila.
Hello, Violet. How's my favorite 'bowlerina' doing?
You keep that up Carmelita and one day you'll be a champion just like Mr. Skinner here. What do you think, Theo? Think Carmelita's got the stuff?
Who wants to know?  Zeus!
I'm sick of you people. Why don't you leave him be?
He's my father, Millie.
Whips...orange whips.
Mine, and they never tip.
Won't your father help you with that?
No, not at all.
The ladies in Akron call them thigh- ticklers.
Not while I'm in training.
Nobody in this town really understands Junior. When I went to family sessions for him I realized he was the sanest one in the family. Actually, he's the only one in this whole fucking town who knows exactly who he is and what he wants.
So, what about you?
Well, that was plan A.
Plan B is your dad.
You're here.
Zip.
He's my father.
Did you - kill him?
If he's not dead, he'll keep coming back.
I feel sick.
I killed him once, I'll just have to kill him again.
SSHHEEIILLAAA!
We provide some extracurricular activities for the senior citizens in the community.
Fletcher, I want you back here.
How long will that be?
Yeah.  I heard you.
Forgive me.  I've never read the Navy manual.  I wonder what it says about bathroom and shower procedures.
What if it attacks?
Why can't I -- ?  What the hell is going on here?
That's our reserve air.
Captain.
From what?  What's with all the security?
Storm?  What storm?
It's impossible.
What?
I don't know.  That's the point.
When was this?
-- without a cautionary word to anyone.  You know, Ted said something to me earlier.  I think he's right.  He said, "When you got a guy who -- if he wasn't here -- he'd be standing in the unemployment line, you gotta question if you got the right guy."
The message doesn't show a lack of intelligence.  It's smart.  It's approaching us in a simple way.  Like you would a dog.  Holding out your hand, letting it sniff, get used to you.
I think we should be careful. Consider his emotional response.
Maybe so.  But I think we need to ask Jerry about it.
Pull it.
Thank you, I can see that.  Try something else.
Harry?  Can you copy?
Send them, damn it!  I know, but I'm not gonna be held responsible --
To the craft?  None.  Not a scratch.
So do we.  And it seems to have picked up something on it's travels.
It could.  But the odds of it being any use to us are against it.
What's the message?
He understands me fine.
What -- you want me to retype it?
What are you going to do -- shoot her?
Radiation shield, you think?
What do you make of this?
What?  No, I know they're civilians...
Get out of there.  I don't want anyone going anywhere outside, understood?
Underwater?
We can't go down there.  We're not prepared.  That deep?  That takes years of training, Beth.  We're just scientists.  Lab scietists.  We wear ties and lab coats to work -- not oxygen tanks.
Yeah.  Drowning.
A bad one.  It was the only book in there.  Norman, come here, look at this.
My gosh, Norman.
Yeah, why?
They are or they aren't.  Which is it?
Beth.
C'mon, Beth.  Don't make this personal.  He told me himself they were taking us back.
Calm down, Beth.  Alright?
What?
Don't bother me, Norman.
I can't see anything.  How does it look?  Still clear?
You fixed this suit?  Beth?
Yeah, well, I get that way when I'm facing death and someone deserts me.
The refridgerator.
All I know is I opened that refridgerator --
His dream?  You can't control your dreams.  And you can't control your fears, can you?
How long does it last?
You want to kill him?
Thirty years ago.  In residency.  I passed out.  You?
You're not sorry.  You're scared.  You're a psychologist, Norman.  You pride yourself on knowing when someone's lying to you, not telling you the truth.  And now you're scared ... because you're not sure you can tell anymore.
Where are you?
Snakes?  What do you mean, exactly?
Same reason I put explosives around the habitat.  For defense.  For the power.  To protect myself.
Yes, someone did.  But it wasn't me, Norman.  It was you.  You manifested the snakes.
One lonely, terrifying sea snake.
It's either this... or I kill you.
Yes.  And I think we already know it will.
It doesn't make any sense.
A light switch.  A button opened that door -- the craft runs on some sort of power.
We never even had a conversation, Norman.
Just in time for what?
We can refuse to talk.
I'm not being defensive.
I'm completely serious.  There is something very important missing from that spacecraft.  You know what that is?
Meaning we're never gonna get the chance to tell anyone.
Curious, isn't it?  What's inside? Before I die, I'd sure like to open it and see.
What noise?
Shut up and catch.
I'm trying to keep balance with --
Just pull her -- down like inside -- Harry, work with me here!
Norman thinks we shouldn't be going down.  Thinks it's a mistake.
Is it some sort of joke?  Like one of those hoaxes?
Yeah, I'll work on it, too.
"We are friends".
They're in the sub, sir.  Waiting.
What report?
Who's everyone?
What the hell would a geologist be doing at a plane crash?
Earth doesn't have a patent on buttons, Ted.
Sure, why not.  Give him the trophy. That pretentious son of a bitch.  You heard him, Norman.  All that "someone went to a lot of trouble, try again" bullshit.  And "impotent".  Where does he get off saying I'm impotent?  He's a fucking self-righteous, little prick.
Why's that?
I'm not sure.
You seen my suitcase?
Four.  Four years --
You might get your stuff together. We'll be coming up on Organa Major soon.
I'm beginning not to like you.
There is a greater risk in staying here, you know.  If you don't find the princess, then the whole trip was for nothing... wasn't it?
We'll be back before you are, old man.
What do you mean, 'good morning'? Do you mean that it is a good morning for you, or do you wish me a good morning, although it is obvious I'm not having one, or do you find that mornings in general are good?
Couldn't we have tried to think of something else first!
I know your intentions.  I probably know much more about you than you realize.  In many ways you're a lot like your father.  He was an indulgent man, but a clever warrior.  Now what brings you out here?
But you must!  I can't do it alone. I'm not at all like my father.  I'd never make it.
That's where my father was killed.
Five, maybe.  Let me handle it.
Keep away, I'm fine, I'm fine.
He can't find Organa Major.
I don't get it, but I guess I did block it.
I've got it blocked.  I'm all right.
What's that?
Then I think we're due the reward you offered... and it had better be substantial after what we've been through.
All right, all right! You've got a ship!  But where do we go from here?  They probably took her to find the hidden bases... I don't see how we can find the rebels before she breaks.  The Empire has already beat us out.
Maybe the fact that no one would go there voluntarily could help us. They probably don't think anyone would dare try.
Move out of the way!
Come back here... Where are you going?
They must be shielded somehow.  I'm sure the base is there.
He'll be well cared for.
You used my savings!  You stole my savings.  If my father were here...
I'm sorry, sir, I'm only a 'droid,' and not very knowledgeable of such things... not on this system anyway. As a matter of fact, I'm not even sure which system we're on.
Several, I think.  There is not much to tell.  I'm not much more than an interpreter, and not very good at telling stories, not at making them interesting anyway...
If you don't mind my saying so, sir, I don't see how anyone could live in this forsaken place.
Sir, I have a couple of extra circuits.  Perhaps they might bring something.
What an honor...
Sir, no, sir.
Sir, I needed everyone in my squad operational, sir... I... I wanted to win, sir.
Don't have to... Some mating semaphore is pretty hard to miss.
Your father will never let you.
If you can't do those numbers, you haven't got a chance.
Dizzy wouldn't want our tears. She'd want us to remember her... with a vengeance. So go out and kill a bug for Dizzy. Kill as many as you can. You are her revenge, and every bug you kill honors her death.
Everyone is going to the dance. Aren't you ?
Only when I give you an order.
Don't mess with the boss. So what'd the captain say ?
Excuse me...!
Please, I... Everybody's lost someone by now. This shouldn't be any different...
Yeah.
Carl can wait.
You two have so much in common.
I'm gonna do it, Carmen. I'm gonna sign up for Federal Service.
Who cares ?
Did you get Starside R&D ?
I'll miss you, too, Johnny.
What do you think ? Everyone did it when we got our wings. You don't like it, do you ?
We gotta choke on the mud and the blood and Fleet can't be bothered to spit.
I like it. It's kinda...you.
See you on the bounce !
Yes, ma'am. Star drive in three... two... one...
Hut... hut !
High school... remember ? Run a flip six, three hole play, and you might score...
You got it.
Who gave you this idea ? It's that teacher. What's his name ? You know the one I mean.
Looks like rain.
Good, because you're going to Harvard, and that's the end of it.
Wow ! Santori and Zegema Beach, I've always wanted to go there.
I'm not going on vacation ! I want to be acitizen ! It's my decision. I made it.
Uh, no.
I hope so. I hope you don't ruin your life over some silly little girl who wants to look handsome in a uniform.
This would be mine, sir. Acting Sergeant John Rico. I've assumed command on this mission.
I'm gonna save Carmen.
This is my farm. Now c'mon, give me what you got and get out of here...
Landing zone is extremely hostile. Come down on this transmission !
The difference lies in the field of civic virtue. A citizen accepts personal responsibility for the safety of the body politic, of which he is a member, defending it, if need be, with his life. The civilian does not.
Looks like a bug was in his brain, sir.
V'ger is that which programmed me.
That unit no longer functions. I have been given its form to more readily communicate with the carbon-based units infesting Enterprise.
V'ger travels to the third planet to find the Creator.
You may proceede.
The carbon-units infection will now be removed from the Creator's planet.
You infest and control Enterprise. V'ger believes carbon-units interfere with the Creator in the same manner.
May I ask Why?
No, Admiral. I don't think you are; not one damned bit. I remember when you recommended me for this command. You told me how envious you were, and if only you could find a way to get a starship command again. Well, sir, it looks like you found a way.
None available, Captain. There's no one in fact, who's fully rated on this design.
No...  ... that could also be misinter- preted as hostile, Mr. Decker.  Cloud composition, Mr. Spock?
Captain, we can't be sure that our... move... will actually save Earth.
That probe in there -- in a different form now -- is the same thing that <U>killed</U> Ilia!
   We have twenty-one minutes. Captain,    we can still save V'ger... and ourselves.
You got the Enterprise, it's what <U>you</U> wanted. This is what I want.  But, Jim...  ... <U>I'm</U> the right choice for this mission.
Decker....!
Unidentified small object has been pulled into the wormhole with us, Captain! Directly ahead...!
No more than I expected  Not as difficult as this. I'm sorry...
If I'd seen you again, would you have been able to say it?
Welcome aboard, Lieutenant.
Twelve seconds...!
I stand corrected Mr. Decker.  Navigator, lay in a conic section flight path into the cloud center; bring us parallel to whatever we find in there...
Impact in fifteen seconds...
Opinion, Mister. Spock?
He's in Engineering, sir...  He doesn't know.
Thrusters at station-keeping, sir.
Thrusters ahead, one third.
That was the order, Mr. Sulu: Clear the bridge.
See that it is.  Take me over, please.
And whatever you sensed out here....
But they understood our messages; they broke off the attack.
Mr. Decker... ?
Transmit image of the Alien to Starfleet; advise we are attempting further communication.
Get someone up here to take the Navigator's station...!  Engineering... full emergency power!
Exact patterns. The energy bolt that hit them wasn't simply a weapon -- it dematerialized them, stored them. But why?
No meaning... No hope...  And, Jim, no answers...! Jim, it's looking for <U>answers</U> <U>itself</U>!
High mag, Mr. Sulu!
... and then to reassemble itself <U>combined</U> with the Creator. The most certain way of obtaining all the Creator's answers.
Yes, Captain. It needed our mortality, the fear of it, our struggle against it, our fears, our dreams...
I prefer your poet Dante's phrase -- 'the divine restlessness of the human spirit.'
Based, I am told, on your recommendation, Admiral. Thank you.
Captain Decker requested I complete final Science briefing here before...
Which will require twenty more hours at minimum, Admiral...
To you, sir?
Helm ready, sir.
Subspace frequencies are jammed by Wormhole effect!
Annie...got an umbrella...?
You wrote a play on it, what play is that?
You quit.
Why did you quit?
It's about life.
I understand...
As the Old Mill goes around...
Goodbye.
...I always thought so...
Well, I guess I'll...get down to the station.  It was lovely meeting...
The <u>Firehouse</u>...
Wait wait wait wait wait he gets a second chance, do you see?  And <u>you</u> get a second chance!
Cast stood me up.
You got a paperclip?
Better idea...
One moment.
Then I'll come back, then.
I'd love to.
Yes...
...well, we do that <u>anyway</u>...
That's why we filmfolk get along so well with you farmers.  Both up with the chickens.
You got to tell em that you saw the accident.  Don't you?
...you think that's right...
What is it, a surprise?
Yes, that's right.

You have to what?
Mr. Bailey.
Thank you.
I think he's moved...
I wasn't in the car.
I think I should talk to my agent, Marty, you and I should, we should, really not discuss...
I really think that <u>business</u>...matters should be discussed between you t...
I, actually yes.
I feel so <u>close</u> to you...

I'd prefer it if you didn't speak to me.

Eight hundred thousand dollars in cash.
What the hell are <u>you</u> so down about?
He should be put in jail.
A witness to what...?
You mean <u>with White</u>...?
The writer.
I just saw the Mayor, he said anything we...
We're very upset with her.  Get someone to <u>double for her</u>, her tits, the tits scene, call L.A.  I want to see some <u>pictures</u> of the women's <u>tits</u>.  Of their <u>tits</u>.
Then, you <u>write</u> that.  And then this is <u>our</u> second chance.  That's why we're here...
I hurt my finger.
He's got a date, he's got a date, is this guy fantastic...?  Already he learned how to write a movie, and he found a girl to get his toes curled, what a guy, what a...what a literary find...!
You want me to lie.
So be it.
Her tits!  Her tits!  How, that she signed IN HER CONTRACT, we hired her 'cause of ten years at the Actors Studio? The way she played <u>Medea</u>?...Her last two pictures laid there on the screen like my first <u>wife</u>...
I really don't think you should be talking this way to a lady.
I can write it.  I can't type it.
No.
What glasses were you wearing?  Were you wearing your reading glasses...?
A spate of suspicious fires which were in fact the inspiration for the formation of the Waterford Huskies...

Gimme Howie Gold.  Howie?  Thizz...I neee...I NEED EIGHT HUNDRED GRAND.  I...I don't care where it comes from...  It comes out of our end.  I...I need...JUST GET ME THE MONEY. I...JUST GET ME THE GODDAMN MONEY...Look:
You tell me what to do, I'll do it.
...not the Lazyboy...
Bob Barrenger, Claire Wellesley, the <u>director</u>...
Yes, I hear it.
I saw Budgie Gagnon, leaning on the bank of the building.  Said, "What are you doin'?"  He said, "I'm waitin' for the 'leven o'clock crossing..."
Mmm...
He's been playin' Old Farmer nigh on sixty years.
Ain't no second chances in life.
I NEVER do that, you ALWAYS lie!
Annabelle, daddy and I will always be there. That's one time always is always.  You can call him after dinner but...
Then why are you putting on mascara?
No I'm not.  I don't care.  Why should I care?  I mean nobody asked me when you got divorced.  Nobody asked me if I wanted a new mother.  Nobody even asked me if I like her.  If you guys don't care about our family staying together, why sh...
Well.  It's for you.
Like a big sister.
You lied.  If you lied <u>then</u>, maybe you're lying <u>now</u>.  I can <u>never</u> belive you <u>again</u>!
Where's Rache?  It's <u>Thursday</u>, we get to be with <u>Rache</u>!
...I'm not deaf, y'know.
And...?
Every time I'm on the lunch yard, and he's with twelve of his retarded <u>dorkface</u> little adoring out-crowd <u>henchmen</u>...
...they all yell 'There goes the Virgin Queen' or the 'Ice Princess', or some <u>really</u> clever cut like that. Like it hurts my feelings.
This is a joke, right?
He's badgering a witness.  Eat.
And this is my room so get out!
I don't know...I feel like I'm gonna throw up.
Now could she just...<u>forget</u> me!
Why don't you say hello?
Annabelle pick up the phone.
That doesn't bother me.
You're just a <u>stepmother</u>.  So stop <u>bossing</u>, cos nobody's <u>listening</u>!
No, <u>his</u> mother's always on time.
Not use my words, please!
No.  But they stand out, a little. Like this.
He'll be impressed.  The clincher is, you <u>walk</u> away, then <u>whip</u> around...
There's worse things.
Fine.
Hello?...Duncan...The Ad Agency's already there?...I'm out the door...  Ben!  Knock it off!  It's gonna go beautifully...  Damn it Ben --
No!
Thank you Ben.  That was so sweet of you.  Goodnight Annabelle.  Sweet dreams.
Aren't you going to drink your cocoa? It's the good kind.
&quot;And a picture of the cow jumping over the moon...&quot;
Well, that's a long way off, sweetie. We'll talk to Mom and Dad...
I knew where I was all the time.
People like Rachel who only think about themselves often do make a lot of money.
Honey, this is Thursday.  I pick you up tomorrow, and we do <u>big</u> spaghetti.
I did.  Do I have to eat lamb? Daddy didn't cook it, she did.
Pray.  We never find out.
You have the WORST flu since...
Is your bad?
How do you know?
Rache can do that part.
Can I talk to you?  When you're there.
You've got a fruit loop in your hair.
Sure.  I was just doin' my nails.
At first.  Then, after awhile, some chemo.
We don't KNOW if you've got it, we haven't SEEN it yet!  Now go back and FINISH!
You tried that last week and we were on hold forty-five minutes...
Easy enough.
Jackie, <u>we</u> were taking them water- skiing for the <u>whole</u> weekend!
Do you realize what could have hap- pened to your son today?  How lucky we are the police found him before some lunatic did?  He could have been...
Not to me.
<u>Slugs</u>.  Have faster learning curves. <u>Trees</u>, even.
To make it easier for them or you?
No.  You think this is going to help the kids then you do it.  You're on your own.
Remember when Mommy and Daddy got divorced?
This is Friday, her riding lesson is on Tuesdays.  I got it right here...
You listen carefully because I am only going to say this once.  That woman has nothing more to do with my children.
How the hell would you know?
See, I know that.
She was afraid you'd make a big deal out of it.
Doesn't <u>begin</u> to describe it. I mean, you've got cancer, <u>this</u> is serious.
It's promising, this one.  We're upbeat.
Yeh, she's...I'll get you Ben first, it's past his bedti...
You mean, after I'm dead?
Yes.  I made the choice that was right for me.  And I don't regret it.  But even for me, there were days when I felt so lost, so invis- ible.  And then I'd hate myself for the kids not being enough.
Feeling the pressure?
Aw.
Oh please.
<u>That's</u> what it is.  And that's <u>all</u> it is.
Is scary.  But you want it.  Gimme some truth here.
Come on, a wuss like me?  The stiff who wouldn't help her own daughter fight back?
I lost him.  I was panicked.
I was running around like a chicken with my head chopped off.  Doing my imitation of you.
You're the hip and fresh.
Just want to be a little sharper. For a few minutes.
Yeh, it's cheaper.
Can't handle them myself is what you mean.  Can't.
Rache, get out of th...
Okay...Is that the good thing or the bad thing?
Hold your applause.  We're not having fun, here.
You took a fishing trip with the boys. Liked it so much, you took another.
Let me put it this way.  Hell, no.
By way of saying you were unhappy.
In seven years Jackie's never missed one of Tucker's parties. Where is she?
What if he is?
Man, I am out of here! This family is so fucked!
Oh, yeah?
Hmmm...Do I know any...personally...?
He's vegetarian, doesn't do sports...
But I thought he came over to America before the war.
It was God's will.
No.
I'm always working.
No.
He's dead.
He wasn't.
I know!
Nothing, I guess?
Hip alternative types who will understand the process better?
I'm serious! What happens if he blows up the school?
You started filling out your college applications yet?
How was the class?
But then, in a sense, since you would never have met Dad if your family had stayed in Europe...if it weren't for Hitler, none of us would have been born.
What's tomorrow?
You mean, again?
Patronizing fuck! If you had just been honest with me in the first place I wouldn't have read it. I knew it was shit. But - idiot! - I believed you!
Well, I sure didn't hear you voice your opinion in there when it mattered.
You're absolutely right. The focus is on the college admissions process today.
I have a cousin. Very big giver to the alumni fund.
...But Mr Livingston, aren't you a bit fearful that Scooby will be confronted with hollow values and systemic conformism?
Just the same.
Tired of this shit...
Thanks.
Yeah. Sure Go ahead. Hypnotize me.
OK!
Gee, you're home early!
Sure, Dad.
Good.  'Cause I...um...I really agreed with everything you had to say last week about how bad my story was...
No.
C'mon. Talk to me. Tell me what you're thinking.
Toby Oxman.
Great!
That's what I was gonna ask you.
Well, um, I kind of let things go on this novel I'd been really into - I mean, the whole publishing industry is totally corrupt. I mean, really, it's finished.
I'm a documentary filmmaker.
N-not yet. I'm hoping to get a grant for this one project on teenagers. Geez, remember when we were teenagers?
Hunh.
Eight, six, and four.
Yeah, sure.
It's my Dad's He hides it under some old TV Guides in his closet.
No, I don't think so...
I'm not an idiot, man. I watch TV.
Well, no. I'm doing one on high school students, in fact.
HBO and MTV have also shown some interest.
Sure?um?yeah, as soon as I have a screening I'll let you know.
Th-th-they'll kill one hostage every hour until it is--
Well get someone down there!
What are you going to do, Cooper, throw yourself on a Bunsen burner? It's a bunch of businessmen touring a lab.  We'll be out in no time.
Just the soda, please. Cooper heads down the hall.  Filmore watches him leave, sighs, then turns and smiles at the General manager:
What do you think?
Rule two:  without alternative, use yourself as a shield.
Even better.
I don't see why they wouldn't be.
It's nothing to worry about.
We have a special forces squadron out of Thailand surrounding the compound as we speak.
Chemco's been developing nerve gas?
He's in there...
Mister Myers it is a chemical plant! There are a number of volatile compounds-- but they are safely stored away...
What!
I'm in to the directory but they've codified the stockpile--numerically.
Excellent...excellent!
Gotcha.  We've been filling barrels all day--we've got  hell of a stockpile.
I say we head out.
The thing weighs more than a ton-- you want to roll up your sleeves and try it?!
At his office in the Capitol.
Bah!  All you wanted to do was spy in our country!
Naturally.  It would kill us just as surely even if we set it off in your country.  But this way we know it's safe, and we don't have the problem of delivering it.
That's right, fella.
Come in...come in... Peace On Earth... Peace On Earth...yes...
The three-letter code group.  Or maybe some combination of the three letters. P...O...E, or P...E...O, or E...O...P... let's see, there would be six possible combinations.
What?
Look, Colonel.  You keep me covered, but let me just pick up this red telephone that connects to Air Command headquarters. Okay?...I won't play any tricks on you... Okay?
Now look here, Miss Pietraszkiewicz, this is Air Command Headquarters calling.
What did you say, sir?
General Schmuck, we monitored a trans- mission about six minutes ago from Burpelson Air Force Base, HQ 843rd Wing.  It was apparently directed to their Wing on air- borne alert.  It decoded as - Wing attack, Plan-R.
I'm afraid I'll have to ask you to take the film out.
I want him upped to Brigadier General, and recomended for the D.S.C.
Yes, sir.  I just thought of something, sir.  How do I know I'm talking to you now?
To you, sir.  But how do I know?
Plan-R????
No, sir.  I'm just bringing the facts to your attention, sir.
Oh, it's not my radio, sir.  I picked it up in the communications center.
Well, General Ripper, sir -- I was thinking -- we're on a condition red, aren't we?
Well, sir, I was thinking, if an enemy attack is in progress, how come the radio's still playing music?  It's supposed to go off, and all we should hear are Civil Defense broadcasts.
I've given it alot of thought, Major.  Don't think I haven't.
That's close enough, Major.
Our missiles would impact before my planes were even discovered by the enemy, wouldn't they?
You're absolutely right.  You forgot to mention their nuclear subs.  But it wouldn't matter. Sure we wouldn't get off without getting our hair mussed, but we'd prevail.  I don't think we'd lose more than fifty million people, tops.
Not yet, Major.  Not yet.
Well, sir, I remember an example that pointed out that if a system was safe on 99.99% of the days of the year, given average luck it would fail in thirty years.
Major, I happen to believe in a life after this one, so I believe I will have to answer for what I have done.  I think I can.
Naturally I am, sir.
No, they wouldn't send us in with bombs on an exercise.
Thanks, Binky.  Can you see Bromdingna Island yet?
Can't help it.  What's the wind like?
They must have clobbered some of our cities already!
The dirty, stinking, rotten, sons of B's!! They might have clobbered Marge and the
Fifteen!  Twelve o' clock.
Missile and plane flight path computer showing four greens.
They're moving apart.
Hey, Terry, I'm hit.
Sure, I'll take her up to eight hundred.
Roger, I'm setting up the CRM-114.
Listen, I think I'm hit bad.
Damn you, Lieutenant Toejam!  Lothar!
Hellnno, Major.  I was just trying to think the thing through.
Bomb doors circuit is green, bomb release circuit is green, bomb fusing circuit is green.
All right, Lothat, that does it.  Master safety on now until bomb run.
Everything still checks out okay.
Lothar, get up here fast, and bring your First- Aid kit!  I'm hit kinda bad, I think.
I tried everything.  Something must have gotten bent or twisted from the pounding we took.
I'd be mighty proud if you did, Lothar.
But they couldn't come out for a hundred years!
Alright. She told him to meet us here. Fuck.
Sure, all the time, in Group.
No. Oh, maybe. Fuck.
Yeah.
Well, sure, he's rich and he's famous. He's got everything and you've got nothing.
Was it okay?
Yes.
Tim, he listens to you. Do you think it's a good idea? Seriously?
What's it about?
No, I, you know, I help 'em out. I empty bedpans and bring 'em lunch. That kind of thing.
Oh, some of 'em. But it's mostly just strokes and shit. I mean, most of 'em just sleep all the time and get kind of yellow. Usually they die id they're, you know, really yellow.
Oh, untrue, Jeffster. I think, uh, two weeks ago we attended a concert where I had fucked two girls.
And your mom.
Yeah, no, it wasn't even my idea.
That's the rock star thing.
Oh, I'll bet you he has a babe with him right out of a triple-x video. Oh, oh, Pony, come on, give it to me! Stud! Oh!
Same, more of the same. Yep, just keep doing the same thing all the time, around and around the clock. With an occasional burger or slice of thrown in for our vitamins and energy. Then, instead of watching Gilligan, we'd watch Captain Kirk.
No, look, this is not about Sooze, alright. Wait, wait, wait, wait. She stayed at the Four Seasons last night with Pony?
No.
No, shut up! Look, look, alright, Tim is in trouble.
Erica is in the van back there.
No, no, no.
Really?
Buff, please, would you jus fuck off, okay? Fuck off!
Hey.
Mm. You know, does he tell you about how, uh, Jeff, Pony, started the band...?
Well, that's one way of putting it.
Shit.
In what way?
Alright, Pony!
Yup. Hey, um, so, um, listen, man, I got to go show the tape to Danny at the hotel, and if I get the gig, Erica is gonna teach me how to surf in L.A.
I will.
That's it. That's it! I'm calling the police.
Yes I do. My family owns it. It's ours. You don't belong here.
Glad it's okay.
Naw, naw, we don't have time for all that.
Yeah.
Yes!
It's nice here. It's different.
No, not really. I come from an "area". Bel Air.
You cut off your little finger?
It's nice to do a lot of things.
We were?
Thank you.
Yeah, well, that pizza could feed a family of four in Turkey or India or wherever the fuck he comes from.
Who were you talking to?
Ask your girlfriend.
What?
Yeah, fuck 'em.
Because I was fucked up, man. I just kept hittin' her till she didn't move anymore.
Wow. You did that for me?
Hey, you saw that brown bitch point a gun at me last night, man. Did you think she was gonna use it?
You don't know?
Will you just put the gun down?
I'm not doing it anywhere, Jeff. It's just part of my application to the School of Visual Arts in New York.
Oh, yeah, right. Yeah, right. Fuck you.
Like I'm going to pay twenty bucks to see Neil Moynihan in some band that I helped start.
It was just something that got out of hand. Did anyone get hurt?
Did it ever occur to you that I might have some feelings about you moving to New York?
Okay, well, then, I'm gonna break new ground.
Okay, look. My job is not who I am. I don't need that. Why? What's your goal? Status? Money? Getting your picture on the cover of some glossy magazine?
So, what, why can't you do that here? What's wrong with here? Why is somewhere else better?
Yes, you do.
Jeff!
God, you smell like whiskey.
Is that a threat?
We sold, uh, over ninety thousand units and uh... and Danny says that we're gonna get a gold record. Yeah.
Yeah, shit. Naw, man, you know. It's hard work, you know?
The road's hell, you know? I mean airport, hotel, show. And airport, hotel, show. Airport, hotel, show. I mean, fuck, man, you know? You still living at your mom's?
No, man, I mean it. You're a good writer. I remember those things you'd write during honors English. Funny shit.
What?
Yeah. You should show 'em to me.
Yeah, maybe later.  Hey! Hey!
Look, man, it... Shit. Why don't we get something to eat? I mean food?
Burnfield. No place like it.
Oh, there you are, honey. We were waiting for you. What happened?
You know what? Go ahead and shoot me. Go ahead! Fucking shoot me! Come on! Come on, man! Come on!
Hey!
New York, huh?
You have to go. You always did such, uh, you know, great work. I still have some of those drawings that you'd do in study hall.
I do. Jeff, don't you think Sooze should go to New York and, uh, you know.
Yeah, and I was thinking, Sooze, you could do the cover.
Oh, no, man. I can't.
Alright!
Mine too.
Mm-hm.
Yep.
I don't know. I say what I mean.
Yeah, but sometimes I try to figure out why I left in the first place, you know? I think about people and I wonder what they're doing.
Or the future, oh, no, no, I mean... I mean, we'll be working on that album cover, right?
Yeah?
Nobody's fucking anybody!
Uh, I didn't write any songs. You guys go ahead. I gotta stay here and guard the parking lot.
Pal, she's a big girl, you know? I'm sure she's alright.
About what?
Whatever.
It's none of my business?
Missed it. Can I get a fifth of Old Crow?
Come on, Jeff.
Uh, excuse me, I'd like to know where he gets his ideas.
There was this other place where they served live monkey brains. Sweat to God. You walk in, they bring the little monkey out, shave his head, crack it open, and you eat it's brains while it's still alive. I didn't go in, though, 'cause I didn't have any money and my mom has a saying: "Don't write any checks you can't cash".
I just pulled and it - it came off.
Sorry, Kansas...
Oh for Chrissakes...  "White trash Betty."  I didn't realize the rules went into effect before we entered Safeway.
You just became a statistic!
Cleo!
Forget it.  I've got a scholarship to Harvard hanging over my head.  I won't risk it.
Cleo, I've already thrown up twice today - could you please get to any relevant part of the movie?
And they get caught!
Of course - of course!  Hands in...
Hee-hee-hee, haaaaa-that's it?  Hee-hee hee...
That's right.  Practice makes perfect. I'm practicing to have a baby right now. If we do a practice job, we'll not only get the experience, but also the extra money we need for guns!
She thinks you went to the police.
I don't know... And what the hell was that sound she made right before she hit the coffee table.
Yeah.
Y'think?
Diane, I've loved you ever since I first saw you -- right before you kicked me in the head.
Jack...
Trix...
Mmm-hmmm...
We're here for you, Diane.
Remember, Kansas, every time you point a finger you've got three more pointing back at you.
Just call me later.  I gotta get some smokes for Grandma.
Kim-Lo?
We're dead!  They showed this prison movie to my youth group on Sunday.
Hold on...
Shit!  Yeah, Grandma.  Me and the squad.
I'll get them before "Touched by an Angel," don't worry.
Maybe we can make a deal.
Am I the only one who cares about this? At least I watched "Dog Day Afternoon!"
Bank branch!
So could half the women in here.  And I'd rather go out with a nice can... So watcha here for?  To say how much you hate me or how much your grandparents hate me...
Before you?  Whoo-hoo!
Oh, Jesus Christ, Mom!  Like my life ain't a great big pile-of-shit 'cause you're in here?  Now I have to add, "P.S. My mom's a dyke" too?
I want to help.  I'm part of this squad...
I'm terribly sorry, Mr. de Mille.
I can tell her you're all tied up in the projection room.  I can give her the brush ...
Action! The scene starts.
Hi, Artie.
I mean, could you put me up for a couple of weeks?
I'm sorry about New Year's. Would you believe me if I said I had to be with a sick friend?
I've got to run along.  Thanks any- way for your interest in my career.
Schaefer.  Betty Schaefer.  And right now I wish I could crawl into a hole and pull it in after me.
I just think pictures should say a little something.
We could make some paper boats and have a regatta.  Or should we just turn on the shower?
Are you hungry?
You'll be waiting for me?
You don't know how glad I am to see youl
I've got twenty pages of notes. I've got a pretty good character for the man.
Sorry if I crossed you up.
Well, for heaven's sake!
See if they make sense.  To begin with, I think you should throw out all that psychological stuff -- exploring a killer's sick mind.
This story is about teachers -- their threadbare lives, their struggles.  Here are people doing the most important job in the world, and they have to wprry about getting enough money to re-sole their shoes.  To me it can be as exciting as any chase, any gunplay.
I'm not good enough to write it alone.  We'll have to do it together.
You're tough, all right.
Came  on back.  Let me show you where it fits in.
What's good about it?  I miss him something fierce.
Who's who?
Come clean, Betty.  At night you weep for those lost closeups, those gala openings...
Was I?  I'm sorry.
Whose house is it?
Whose?
You know, crazy things happen in this business.  I hope you haven't lost your sense of humor ...
We'll be working again, won't we, Chief? We'll make our greatest picture.
But remember, darling -- I don't work before ten in the morning, and never after 4:30 in the afternoon.
I don't care anyway.  I want the coffin to be white.  And I want it specially lined with satin. White, or deep pink.
Depends on what it is -- a Donald Duck or Joan or Arc.
Only asking.  I did't know you were planning a comeback.
They'll love it in Pomona.
This is fascinating.
Sure you did.  That's what makes it great.  What it needs is a little more dialogue.
Of course not.  But it ought to be organized.  Just an editing job.  You can find somebody.
Oh no.  I couldn't let it out of my house.  You'll have to finish it here.
Where do you live?
You can stay here.
What's wrong with It?
Tails.  That's ridiculous.
Cute.  Let's have some drinks.
Just follow me.
Who?
A little.
"Mad about the boy."
Has it ever occurred that I may have a life of my own? That there may be some girl I'm crazy about?
Why not? What I'm trying to say is that I'm all wrong for you. You want a Valentino -- somebody with polo ponies -- a big shot --
I'm not just selling the script. I'm selling me.  DeMille always said I was his greatest star.
They're awful.  They make me cough.
You're a darling.
Nothing is the matter.  I'm having a great time.  Show me some more.
Maybe deMille is shooting.
I don't think so.  It's your script.  It's your show. Good luck.
Good night.
Good.
I went for a walk.
You can't do this!  Max!  Max! ... I can't face life without you, and I'm not afraid to die, you know.
No, they don't.
Goodbye.  Norma.
It will never make house Beautiful. I guess it's O.K. for one night.
Naturally.  I brought them myself.
There are no locks anywhere in this house.
I'm not inquiring where Mr. Gillis goes every night...
More or less.  Only for the end I've got a gimmick that's real good.
Frankly, no.
Look, Mr. Sheldrake, could you let me have three hundred bucks yourself, as a personal loan?
No?
Yes, Madame.
How can you create beauty...with a selfish heart? The spiky insect-creature flies closer and closer around the little girl's head, buzzing angrily. Her look of delight turns to fear. She tries to shoo the creature away. It flies off toward the thin membrane that encloses the city.
What is it?
The danger. The one Nigel spoke of. It must be near .
Softball.
Relax. Tomorrow this will all seem like a bad dream. Goodbye.
Ethan, tell me more about this woman who's after you.
Of course not, but...there are things we don't understand.
Terrific.
Ethan---when I said 'a while' I meant a couple of hours.
Are you asking me for a "date"?
In this big old house on Orchard Avenue---but you better stay away from there.
What?
She has hostages.
Hmmm?
What's that big black scar on the ground? Like a fire.
A passionfruit smoothee.
I'll drink to that.
What an adorable hat.
It's the truth. In twenty-four hours you'll forget all about that girl.
But she is real, it wasn't just a concussion.
You can't escape from me that easily. I'm afraid you don't know who I am.
Don't think I'm weak, just because I'm a woman. I have Power. Give in, stop fighting me, Ethan. I always get what I want.
I don't want your help.
Supergirl?
Oh, no thanks.
You're supposed to guess.
Years ago. And it was Zaltar who stole it.
Why haven't you been able to contact him? He should have returned from the neutron galaxy ages ago. He may be dead. ZOR-EL But what can you, a mere girl-
Can you create life?
No sweat. When's the rest of your stuff arriving?
Since what?? Did you have a fire at your house or something?
It was just a trim.
You sure?
I'm Linda Lee.
No, MR. Danvers.
It may well be. I know how you won that election Selena. You can't fool me.
I have to talk to you.
You would! You revealed our existence so you could have all of our power.
A cheap trick.
It's everywhere. But water is always the door.
Yes, I see it. Shining like a jewel.
What? Palace? Hardly.
No, no. Not lovely. 'Perfect'. Did everything just right. Nobody telling you to change this, move that around. Please yourself. That's the secret of happiness.
The Phantom Zone overlooks everywhere.. If you have the right tools.
It's Selena. I'm getting so I can recognise her work.
Zaltar!
Hey! Y'know what they used to call me in high school?
Nope.  Never. 
It sure is.
Who?
You thought that?
Clark, I think you worry too much about mayonnaise.
There's a lot of choices here.
Me neither...
Ride a thresher? Well, I don't know. Girls are trying just about everything now but --
Me too. That's why I put this one up.
Well, he's going to get the best home-cooked meal he's had in... in a long time. You tell Superman we think he's wonderful.
We get together sometimes.
Sure.
Gus Gorman.
Thirty-five.
They said I lost it on the subway, but it ain't the truth! It was a pickpocket took it!
Well, it was one of them little bitty two-inch screen Japanese jobs.
What about this week's check?
Yeah. A raise . .
Uh...yeah. I didn't think of it that way exactly, but...
Yeah? What do you do with 'em?
Or socks.
Decaffeinated too?
Which country?
Like everything else in the 20th century, Gus. You push buttons.
Wait a second. Astronomers know where the planet used to be, right? And you know what happens when a planet explodes? Debris. Pieces floating in space.
They ain't got captains?
I should think a taste of freedom is enough, don't you? Or would you prefer jail?
Fair's fair.
We've already got some.
What will it do?
It looks wonderful. it is wonderful, let's face it.
Yeah, sure.  Ain't nobody gonna stomp my electric train...
Her name's Lorelei Ambrosia. She's Webster's Girl Friday.
That's his sister. Vera Webster.
You just did, with that great dinner.
Listen, are you sure you shouldn't do something about the bridge?
The picture's fine. That's the way she looks in real life.
No, I don't think I would. So... then what can I do for you?
Hey, I know a lot of things!
Gus?
In other words, push this red button.
53!
Hello.
He's bound to slip up sooner or later.
Storms! Floods!
Today coffee----
How? Shoot him? You know about him and bullets. Not to mention knives, tanks, bombs...
Where did it come from?
It's your genius, pal! You built a machine that can find anybody's weak spot, just like you said.
So far the hostages are unharmed.
Then maybe you should get your glasses checked.
Well, you never will again!  Thanks to Vitamin C! I'm reading a book that says the foundation of a sound body structure is one thousand milligrams of Vitamin C every day.
Oh sure. The American answer to everything. Pills.  No, this is --  -- natural.
Sure! But nobody knows it. Least of all you.  Look, would you mind if I gave you some constructive criticism?
Hah, some guys say I have magic fingers.
But this should be exposed. They get	kids here who are just starting out in life and they take them for every nickel they can get. That's what Perry says.
Oh come on, that's ridic -
I don't want a bodyguard. I want the man I fell in love with.
Sure. Especially if you'd be a really terrific guy and bring me a cheeseburger to go --
Does she know about it? She's in it!
The minute the story broke I bundled her on the first Concord out of here. If Paris goes kablooey I want the best reporter I've got right there in the middle of it.
No offense, Kent. You're good, but Lois is the best we've got.
What else is ballast for?
A bikini! I'll need to buy a new bikini, Lex.  C'mon. After being cooped up in that prison, haven't you thought about me in a bikini . . ...once maybe ?
What'd he say before? He saw a girl?
Yes.
Now This I want to hear.
My kind of people.
North.
We have all of this without you. You cannot bargain with what you don't have.
Revenge! We will kill the son of our jailer!
Constantly.
Really Lois, we've got to stop meeting this --
I must be. But I'm not.  Your home. This is your home.
Are you kidding? I knew it all the time. Did you see how they fell into our trap? Beautiful . . .
Kill me? Lex Luthor? Extinguish the greatest criminal flame of our age? Eradicate the only man on earth . . .
Where is his home, Lex Luthor? Which way?
You'll find out, General! And when you do . . .
We have not the choice to refuse, have we, if we believe it is a real hydrogen bomb that they have.
Sentimental idiot.
Don't worry. I won't make you do it alone. I know all the right places. I'm a member at all the right clubs . . . We'll start tonight at the grand opening of the Metro Club! It's a date!
Actually, I had a crash course from my mother the night before my prom.
What about here?
. . . Let me get my purse.
But they're expecting us. It wouldn't be polite.
I'm sorry to see you go.
I'm not so sure you do.
I don't think we're being treated fairly, Lois. And I'm going to tell Miss Warfield.
Everyone's saying he's . . . dead. But I know that isn't true. I feel it in my heart. I think he just needs help.
Go on . . .
Good. If you can see it, and I can see it, maybe some day everyone will see it.
Stuff it.
I'd just like to have a little less sensationalism.
Don't be over-dramatic, young lady. What kind of disaster could we help bring about?
Let's try to keep your I.Q. a family secret, Leonard. Before we launch him against Superman, we have to test him ... see how well he does with mayhem and destruction. Kind of a coming out party under the glare of media covering the Metro Club gala. And once he proves himself, then . . .
He's . . .  beautiful. Perfect.
Luthor, I suspect if you had actually planted a bomb you'd be far away from here by now.
No, no, listen. I escaped with only one thing on my mind . . . the end of Superman.
Nobody else.
Albert!
North. It's north
I will.
Hey, you're getting a better class of people in your office these days, Boss.
But otherwise it's swell.
Unbelievable.
What the  --  !
You're great with the advice, Clark. Maybe you'd better take over the lovelorn column.
Look, there was probably a trampoline on the roof somewhere and this joker just took a big bounce.
Jealous? Of what?
It isn't that I still don't like you, Clark. It's just that...well, once you've had something like that happen to you, it kind of changes a girl.  I'm going to make some coffee. You want some?
The way you describe him doesn't really do him justice.
Sure, and let the plane crash in the middle of the city.
So it's six hundred feet below Park Avenue, It's still a Park Avenue address.
I know that. Bu tin this case he was right. Arnold 'Buster' Luthor, the most inept check forger of his time --  A pity he didn't live to see his son strike out for the big city. A pity he didn't live to see how, from humble beginnings, I created an empire.
Compared to what came before? A year of living in the sewers?  A part of that will always be with me.
You'll be seeing stars in a minute, Miss Teschmacher. y'know?
What about dinner? I have to worry about the crime of the century, that's all. Y'know? Am I supposed to worry about what's in the refrigerator, too?  What's in it?
First the pets, Otis.
You think he's for real?
I read the article.
There was a recipe on the back  --
Yours not to reason why, Miss Teschmacher. Relax! Enjoy it!  Just look at that smog!
Lex is going bye-bye.
Who? Clark? I never cared two hoots for that fella.  Jonathan Jr. That's got a ring to it.
Don't brag now,  Jonathan.
But why Earth, Jor-El. They're practically animals.
He'll be weightless.
He will be odd, different.
There are none of them any good anyway.
Oh, God! I'm going to die!
Not a chance. It's too nice a night.
Right on the first guess.
I guess they are a little odd.
195 pounds.
What about it?
Uh-huh.
Only when somebody shoots them at me.
Not there!  A pine tree in Death Valley? Idiot! This is for the North Woods section!
I guess I...uh...regressed.
Oh, Mr. Luthor...
They'll soon be over.
We'll see how fast I can fly.
Alison Jones.
He used to work with you.  Until you found out he was having an affair with your wife.
I'd heard that.  But she's well?
Are you still in touch?
Sunnyridge.  That was a long time
I woke to the sound of Zoe's breathing.  It was laboured.  I looked over and noticed she was sweating and all swollen.  I grabbed her, rushed to the kitchen, and splashed water on her face.
I'll tell her that.
No, Mr. Ansel.  I wouldn't sue you.
Why are you telling me this?
Why?
I'm not sure.
Well, Sam, I might as well tell you the truth.  It's this lawsuit you've gotten yourself all involved with. I want you to drop the damned thing.
It does concern me.
How?
Why?  You got money from Dolores' insurance with the school board.  We all did.
I'll help pay for Nicole, if that's what you're really talking about. I'll even give you the money I got for my kids.  That's what we used to do, remember? Help each other.  This was a community.
Sure.
You believe that?
Yes.
You think that caused the accident, Risa?  That it brought bad luck? Christ, it sounds to me you're looking for a witch doctor, not a lawyer.  Or maybe they're the same thing.
What do you mean by that, Dolores?
For rabbits?
Berries.
Berry-picking.
That would complicate things.
There might have been a word or two that slipped by.  Maybe you could clarify it for me, just to be absolutely sure.
The Ottos always waited for the bus with Bear.  They were the only parents who did that, together like that.  I guess they're what you might call hippies.
Well, winter's far behind us now.
Did he say what about?
Was he drinking?  Could you tell?
Don't you usually like to sit at the back?  To wave at your Dad?
Well, if he knew magic - if he could get the kids into the mountain - why couldn't he use his pipe to make the people pay him for getting rid of the rats?
Okay.
What do you want me to do for you, Mr. Stephens?
You seem very sure about that.
Was the bus on time?
And what was the weather like at this time?
...coming home drunk and I guess feeling trapped by his life and blaming her for that...and...
People who will help our cause.
There's the Prescots...
Wanda and Hartley.  They lost Bear. He was their adopted son.  A beautiful boy.  Indian.
That's good.  Judges like adopted Indian boys.  Tell me more about the Ottos.
A car wash!  Wow, I've never talked to you when you've been in a car wash.  Make sure you've got the windows closed.
Don't you want to hear?
You always think you know what I'm going to say, don't you?  You always think you're two steps ahead of me. The lawyer.
I need money.
What is it?
Mrs.  Otto,  there is no such thing as an accident.  The word doesn't mean anything to me.  As far as I'm concerned, somebody somewhere made a decision to cut a corner.  Some corrupt agency or corporation accounted the cost variance between a ten-cent bolt and a million dollar out-of-court settlement.  They decided to sacrifice a few lives for the difference.  That's what's done, Mrs. Otto.  I've seen it happen so many times before.
Excuse me?
About eight-thirty in the morning.
Why were you scared?
Dolores was driving too fast.
Seventy-two miles an hour.
Yes.
No.
No.  Because the bus went off the road.  And crashed.
Really?
Just the way Dolores gets so excited about bringing the kids to check out the animals.  It's like the biggest thing in her life.
Nothing.
Mrs.  Ansel's clothing.
Don't even try to remember.
The ramp?
Very slick.
Oh.  I better get some spackle.
How about Sunday night?  That's always the best time.
There's talk of that.
The Ottos.
Hitler!
Your nephew doesn't want a drink.
And with ten percent of his future, you're great, too, Frank.
Not in those exact words - you know what a temper he's got.
Four five nights ago.  That's how I know the romance is off.  Also Steve's in a very bad mood.
And, instead, he printed his heel in your face?
Give me a chance --
Hurry back.
Who said Sidney?
Now don't kid a kidder.
I don't believe it.
Yeah, I got eyes.  I put things together.
Why not break it up yourself?  You could do it in two minutes flat.
I'll listen one more minute.
Then maybe you can tell me if he's as solid as you say, why does he rap me every chance he gets?
Yes.  With your "prestige" it only takes a minute - ten cents worth of American Tel and Tel.
Sure you can if you want to, and I know you'll want to...  By the way, what's your beef against little Sidney?
Sure, he steams her up - wants her to stand on her own two feet and all that jazz!
Calculated risk.  Only we happen to know, J.J., that you like me.  I'm your star pupil -- I reflect back to you your own talent.
She knows now.
The man in jail is always for freedom.
J.J., I swear to you on my mother's life, I won't do it.  If you gave me your COLUMN I wouldn't do a thing like that...
You're incapable of the truth...
You're sure.  Find out for me.
At the bar - Sidney...
I don't know - it's a big apartment. But I wasn't interviewed.  In fact, I was totally unprepared for what happened.
But, Sidney darling, the man must be out of his mind - it was only eleven o'clock in the morning!
That's what I'm thinking, Rita. Maybe...
I beg your pardon!  I turn myself inside out to help you and now I'm a heavy.  Here's your shoe, there's your coat, that's the door!
Next time I'll call in a guy to paint silver stars on the ceiling!
He wants me to break a leg?
May I rent you out as an adding machine.
I know you do, Sidney.
That's no way to talk...
Well, thanks, anyway - let's forget it.  It's cold out here, Susie.
Frank thinks I shouldn't have come here -
Why don't we hear what Susie has to say?
Who could love a man who keeps jumping through burning hoops, like a trained poodle?
Why should he put on an act?  Your brother has told PRESIDENTS where to go and what to do!
Like you?
I could almost forgive you if what you did to Steve came from jealousy and love...
I'm telling him in the morning after breakfast.
If the stores are open -
Not what you're doing now.  At least don't ask me - don't ask him. You're fighting for your life! What do YOU want to do?
You need a break.  You'll see it clear when you come back.
What chip?
NO!! We're going all the way!  You got that, Dyson?
In the bathroom.  Danny, can you get them for us?
I'm a cybernetic organism.  Living tissue over a metal endoskeleton.
You are targeted for termination.  The T-1000 will not stop until it complete its mission. Ever.
We have to leave the city, immediately.  And avoid the authorities.
I would.
That is one of my mission parameters.
Why?
Right.
No problemo.
It is in your nature to destroy yourselves.
Yeah, I thought you'd like this place.
She intends to change the future somehow.
I don't care!! There's gotta be another way. Haven't you learned anything?!  Haven't you figured out why you can't kill people?
What?
Terminated.
It's John who's the target now.  You have to protect him.  He's wide open.
Remember the message... the future is not set. There is not fate but what we make for ourselves.
There's not much time left in the world, Sarah.
Correct.
Doesn't want you thinking too much, huh?
Then what?
Uh huh, great.  Then those fat fucks in Washington figure, what the hell, let a computer run the whole show, right?
Can you get us in there, past security?
Yes.
On all what?
That's right. I was raised very strictly. So don't speak before you are spoken to!
I don't know.
You call me sir again and I'll make you listen to Beethoven.
was born here, in Leipzig. I escaped in '36. My parents, they sent me to my uncle in Philadelphia. They were to follow. But they delayed and...
The British occupy the building where this guy, Hinkel, ran the Nazi Ministry of Culture and it seems they've... they've discovered his secret archive.
Major Richards said he'd call to let us know.
Major, I don't see how this line of questioning could...
That's why he didn't get the hell out of here when he had the chance! I put that to him, he couldn't answer. Why didn't he go and direct in America, like that Italian, Toscanini.
Yes.
Yes.
Shut the door, Emmi. Sit down, Emmi. We're going to keep him waiting, too.
If he had no idea, why did the Jews need saving? This is the question, Emmi, to all Germans: Why did the Jews need saving in this country? Why, if people had no idea?
That is correct.
Could I have a glass of water, please? Please, Fraulein?
May I ask a question?
I believe it was because of another letter I'd written to Goebbels lamenting the decline of musical standards due to racial policies.
It would be truer to say, I think, that a lot of people in high places knew me.
They were Jews, they had to leave. They were right to leave.  I could not leave my country in her deepest misery. After all, I am a German.  I... I stayed in my homeland. Is that my sin in your eyes?
Yes, a despicable human being. He was in the Ministry of Culture. His job was to get rid of Jews in the arts.
Certainly not, but I knew he had informers everywhere. Even in my orchestra there was someone
He told me to be careful as one of Goebbels' men was watching me. He read a report on me - everything I said was quoted word by word.
Gee, that's a thing of beauty, honest to God, a real thing of beauty. I'm going to try to remember that. Liberty, humanity and justice. Beautiful. But you used the word 'naive'. Are you now saying you think you were wrong? That art and politics can't be separated?
Tell me about von der Null.
Yes, von der Null.
You sure you didn't call one of your close buddies and say, God in heaven, did you see what that guy von der Null wrote about me? The greatest conductor on earth. I want him out the way. He had the nerve to accuse me I am not playing enough modern music. Send him to Stalingrad. Isn't that what you did? You don't like criticism, do you, Wilhelm?  You surely didn't like them saying there was another conductor who was better than you... Are you saying the name von der Null was never mentioned in your talks with Goebbels?
And what did he say?
And what happened to Von der Nul?
It means I wasn't good enough to be a first violinist.
Helmuth.
How could I forget?
Show you?
I was a member of the Communist Party. I was a communist. That's what Hinkel had over me. He knew everything. He held that over me. That's how he made me co-operate.
You don't know what it's like to wake up every single morning of your life terrified, you don't know that - 
One of my people?
But this was the same guy who conducted for Adolf on his birthday.
Yes.
I don't know what you mean, Major.
Jeez, and I never heard of him.
Then how do you explain him being made a Prussian Privy Councillor?
Not really.  Do you think you can get here on time if I put you on the floor as a waitress?
You know your weapons, buddy.
That guy's a jerk.  I did you a favor.
Great.

Look, Reese, I know you want to help, but...
One possible future.  Four your point of view.  I don't know the tech stuff.
Freezing.
Kyle.
What?
It was an honor.  A chance to meet the legend.  Sarah Connor.  Who taught her son to fight...organize, prepare. From when he was a kid.  When you were in hiding, before the war.
Yes.  And I don't want to know where you got it.
You must have had a fun child-
I want to buy you a hot dog so bad,Kyle...all the things you've never seen and done.  You're here, but wherever you go, and whatever you touch, you bring the war with you.
If I do, you have to get away, disappear without a trace. Different country, different name, everything.  In case they send another one.
Ticklish?
You'll beg for mercy in a second.
Why?
Okay.  Okay.  But this...  cyborg...if it's metal...
Six shots at less than ten feet.  Weapon was a large caliber--
I know.
No.  Keep getting an answer- ing machine.
I already did.  No answer at the door and the apartment manager's out.  I'm keeping them there.
Suspect westbound on Olympic.  Grey sedan.  Has hostage, repeat...
Fine, Dennis.  Soon as I get my money for this week.
Please, don't do that...
It was an accident.
I don't know... he fell.
Don't just stand there, get help!
He's turning blue!
What... is... happening... ?
You mean, the guy who turned blue and <u>wet</u> himself... ?
It was a gift... from my brother.
If there was one.
Are you suggesting we wait till someone finds us?
I'm not wearing underwear.  Okay? There, I said it.  Satisfied.
What's C.R.S.?
I think not.
Hm?  Oh, yes.
It was left in my hotel room, well, not really mine.  You're saying it's not you?
You?
Overseas operator?  Please dial Allgemeine Bank, Zurich.
Who the fuck cares?
It might be best if we didn't talk.
Who's responsible?!
Call them, tell them to get the boss up here.  Tell them I'll kill you...
Where'd you get that gun?
Bullshit.  They killed him. Feingold, Fisher, whoever... they shot him...
Stop talking...
What about dinner sometime, when you get back?  Would that be... ?
Single?
Boyfriend?
So do you.  And to think I was worried...
I said I would...
I'll call them, okay?
They're methodical.  They're nothing if they're not that.
You dodged a bullet.
They fuck you and they fuck you and they fuck you.  And then, just when you think it's done, that's when the <u>real</u> fucking begins.
Everything.  I'm a goddamn human-pinata...
Yes.
Yes, very lucky.
What happened to you, Nick?  I mean, look at yourself...
There's nothing to forgive.
Yes.
You're going?  Well, thanks again.  Good to see you, Rachel...  Thanks for coming, Mel.  I'll get your car back.  Right now it's, uh... at the zoo.  Sorry.
A game?
An hour for those... maybe another for the physical.
Cursory examination.  Turn-your-head- and-cough sort of thing.  You'll be out of here in no time.
You mean, I don't like it, he doesn't pay?
What whistle?  There's no fucking whistle.  This is fucking dangerous.
What are you gonna do anyway?  You won't get your money back.
It was a different floor then...
Is there a room key?
No, you didn't...
Have a nice day.
He came to my mind recently, that's all.
Goodnight.  Where was she?
Your brother.  Will you come with me?
No.
Because, if you don't know about society, you don't have the satisfaction of avoiding it.
I wouldn't mention the following, except he was very insistent.  It's obviously some sort of prank...
Why are you following me?
Nice touch.  Does the game use real bullets... ?
Don't ask.
Follow me.
It was a misunderstanding.
You're joking.
Sam...  Thank you.
Well, I... uh...
Come on.  These are the typically sentimental gestures of a depraved industrialist.
I did okay.
Why?
Mary, I'll meet you outside.
But there's a sad catch to the story.
I don't know.  A lullaby I guess. My mother used to hum it to me. And her mother before that, and so on.  Hugh Crain, would you care to dance?
And they're all locked together in here... and he won't let go of them!
It's not real?  Crain?  He's not real?
My mother used to hum this to me. Like her mother hummed it to her. And my great grandmother Carolyn hummed it to her.
No --
Test it.
That?  That's Hill House.
Yes.  It's perfect, isn't it?
Every day.  Basically we'll be hanging out together like we have so far this evening.
I'll take her with me to the University tomorrow.  I can't believe I read the test wrong.  I didn't see anything that looked like she was suicidal.
Are you Mister Dudley, the caretaker?
That's a good question.  What is it about fences?  Sometimes a locked chain makes people on both sides of the fence just a little more comfortable.  Why would that be?
I've seen 'em.  Lot to dust.
It's all I could afford.
You, too.  Happy tossing and turning.
I guess.  Oh, your hair!  It looks good.
No, it's getting worse.
I don't know what to think anymore.
Me too.  Although I learned one thing about you, that you don't know about yourself.  You can be a pretty decent bitch.
I have a loft.
I think so.
Carolyn showed me where she hid him, hid him with all the ones he killed --
Just had to be sure.
Then let's go get you one.
It's an observation.  Like:  I'm hungry. When are we eating?
You demand to be served.  A fork fetishist.
Sure.
All your life.  That happened while I swam the length of my pool.
No, Terry.  They don't work like that. Jenny Wilson's father paid a little visit, left a message.
There's already gonna be talk about how people close to you keep falling into canyons.
Just luck, this, really.  Never been to one of these before.
Round about, yeah.
That's what I thought, man.  But it was not a hotel or nothin' that we went to. It was someplace else.
Did Jenny know?
Fucking out of order, that.  Shouldn't be allowed.
It's only insurance.  Can't be too careful.  This Terry Valentine, he's probably a wonderful fella.  They were together how long?
What post office?
I'd rather be with him than without him. I don't want to be found dead in L.A.
You look alike.
Wanted to talk to you, didn't I?
Been busy, have you.
Hardly buried.  Earning interest, love. Earning interest in an offshore account. Tidy little premium per annum, that.
Now who's being sarcastic?
I'm sorry.  I guess the rest of us have no excuse for wondering where the time went.  It must've been the bars.
Yesterday.  Afternoon.
No, I had -- some other matters to attend to, you know.  Getting a car sorted ...
Well, I gathered something from the article what Eddie sent me.  Some sort of pop music producer, wasn't it.
Now, you shouldn't run yourself down.  My employer, Mr. Lindgren --
-- Mr. Lindgren.
Proprietor of a London firm.  Of longstanding.
Based in London, but with international concerns.
Why not.
You think Terry gave me access to her things?  Probably sold her clothes.
You don't know how I've compromised my standards.
A jeweller's up the West End.  We tunnelled our way under the shop floor from the public lavatory down the road. Filthy work.  Trouble was, the bloody thing collapsed -- <u>after</u> we'd made the grab, 'n all.  Would you Adam n' Eve it.
We were <u>lucky</u> to be nicked.  Me and the lads went down there Sunday evening, we weren't discovered till the Monday.  Good job we were still breathing.
I'll tell ya something:  it made me a model prisoner.  Put me right off any escape attempts.  Tunnel my way to freedom after that experience?  Not bloody likely.
Did you.  What was that in aid of?
It's true.  Has to be said.  I got off to a slow start.
Honest.  Didn't know where to look till I was 21.
You sound like my fucking probation officer.
Good luck to him.  He couldn't find his prick if he didn't wear Y-fronts.
Do us a favor.  Can't even go have a slash without 'em saying, what're you going in there for?
I could use a vacation.  Of course, I keep forgetting, for you this <u>is</u> a vacation.
Nothing financial.  Strictly personal.  I can see how all this import-export malarkey might give rise to confusion where I'm concerned.  A foreigner, showing up unexpectedly, like.
Eh?
Oh, yeah, right.  The deal.
Unless I'm not who I think I am.
No kidding.
Yeah.  Cheers, mate.
Sounds like you need a rest.
I got half.
And I said so what.  You think she's any happier?
Walked.
Susan.
Are you finished?
Have we met?  There's something I can't quite --
At night, there were lights--we both saw them. We never told anyone, outside of our official report.
Hello, Tony.
Pop doesn't like people smoking in here.
That's what he keeps telling me.
Well, sure, I guess. Pop says so too. I work pretty hard at school.
He didn't say that.
Birdy--
No. Uh... family friend.
Well, look, I don't claim to be an expert--
Sorry, friend, I, uh, you got me at a disadvantage.
Way out of line.
Sure.
It's OK.
No, Dave, I wasn't.
Mm.
Mm.
Me? Us! The party at Nirdlinger's--I told you last week, for the Christmas Push.
So?
Honey...
You don't have to tell me anything.
No. Of course not. She didn't do it.
I... just knew. A husband knows.
Look, chum, this is a guy, from what I understand, told everybody he was a war hero, right? Island hopping, practically liberated the Pacific all by himself with a knife in one hand and a gun in the other and twenty yards of Jap guts between his teeth.
...who among us is in a position to say...
Oh, hell. Drink?
OK. Boy. Jesus!
He a good man?
So--
I'm fine. Thanks.
Well, there's Lloyd Garroway in San Francisco. Probity--you know, no one ever said anything iffy about Lloyd Garroway. Conservative. Jury might like that. Might like that here.
Sure, Walter. Thanks.
Oh, no. That was written by Mr Ludwig van Beethoven.
He wrote some beautiful piano sonatas.
Now, being a barber is a lot like being a barman or a soda-jerk; there's not much to it once you've learned the basic moves. For the kids there's the Butch, or the Heinie...
What the--
That's very generous.
Uh-huh.
Not an owner.
Ah-hah. It would be best if he waited here.
You'll go to the prison hospital.
He said OK. Is that what he said?
No.
I'm in.
Why not?
You haven't got the authority.  Only Pendergast can pull the plug.
Get his gun and his walkie talkie, Jonathan.  Move.
What's the combination?
It's a little late, you son of a bitch.  There's a friggin' monster loose in here!  Get the FBI, the fire department.  Find metal cutters, cut through.  And bring a cannon.  The damn thing is huge.
Not at all.  I think we may be working on the same case.  If so, I could use your help.
Where's the head?
Can't really focus on birds at the moment, Pendergast.  I'm tryin' to keep my breakfast down.
Then you won't like this one.  It's a piece of shit.
You're kidding.
How do you explain the part about Beauregard?
Go out the north exit!  There's a hallway and a false wall by the Greek vases.  Run!
Got my hands full here.
There's a dead body in the exhibit! People are panicking, trampling each other trying to get out.
Several problems with that theory. For one thing, this egg is intact. For another, according to Pendergast, the crates were shipped here on a boat.  Everyone on board was killed like Beauregard.  If the thing hatched in mid-ocean, where did it go?
That's not so unusual.  Many plants carry viruses.  Like the burls on Maple trees.
Margo, what you've just described is a killing machine.
They fill seven floors.  We have the largest collection of mammals and dinosaurs in the world.  Just to give you an idea, there are more than three million insects specimens.  Not to mention amphibians, reptiles, birds, anthropological artifacts, meteorites, minerals and gems.  Only about five percent of the museum collection is actually on display.
Footsteps!
Evolutionary Biologist.  I study how life on earth evolved over millions of years.
Well almost.  Depends which house.  It smelled like old hamburger, and it made this weird noise.
Get back!  Now!
I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad tidings, but you know me.  Telegraph. Telephone.  Tell Kawakita.  I got the definitive word from Cuthbert's secretary.  This is Dr. Frock's last week.
Someone's been murdered.  Not shot, strangled or stabbed, either.  Torn limb from limb.  There's talk of a psychotic killer or even an animal.
What's that?
What kind of hormones?
So what?
How about lunch?
Maybe not.
You have time to talk?
You loved him.
Would you mind showing it to me?
When DNA is defective, it often uncontrollably replicates long repeating sequences of the same base pair.  Viruses can damage DNA.  So can radiation, certain chemicals.  Even cancer.  Let's let the G.S.E. sort it out.  I have to get started.  This will take several hours.
No.  I think I'm hallucinating.
Gone.
No.  The planetarium is in the next cell.  This is one of the fire doors...
Its eyesight is worse than I thought.  It couldn't see us.  And it couldn't smell us through the glass.
Oh God!  Help!
You have to!  Listen!  All viruses pass on their own DNA.  Instruct the cells of the host to make more viruses!  This one was different.  It inserted a whole array of genes into John.  Reptile genes, sixty five million years old.  Those genes remade him!  It's not his fault!
<i>Fiji.</i>
I'm sorry, er...the biggest one.
One.
Why wouldn't I?
That's right.
It doesn't matter.  I'll make other arrangements.
He moved down there after Meryl packed up and left.
All prop cars accounted for?
What music?
Thank you.
Amnesia.
But how do you account for the popularity of those eight hours a day when Truman sleeps?
All products carefully chosen and tested by you for quality and aesthetic value.
And it's all available in the "Truman" Show" catalogue.  Operators are standing by.
We accept the reality of the world with which we're presented.  As the show expanded, naturally we were forced to manufacture ways to keep Truman in Seahaven - demonstrating that every venture is accompanied by a risk.
I've been tempted.  But I think it's important to retain objectivity.  I wouldn't want to get emotionally caught up.
You think she'd go through with it?
--I'm not allowed to talk to you.
Saturday?
Yeah?  Outta what?
You think so?
Are you okay?  You look like shit.
No.  Truman, if this is another one of your fantasies...
Things.  Things that doesn't fit.  Maybe I'm being set up for something. You ever feel like that, Marlon?  Like your whole life has been building to something?
Just between you and me, Marlon, I'm going away for a while.
Gee, that's great.
I won't be late.
I think I'm going to stay up for a while.
You hate gambling.
I'm sure they're just exaggerating.
Do something...
Truman, stop it!
I've got something to tell you.  You'd better sit down.
They never found Dad's body--maybe somehow--
Things always do--when you look back.
I'll try.
Fine.  I'll tell her.
Yup.
Nothing completely conclusive --
What's that?
No. Don't bother.
Heard you come here now and again. Figured you'd be needing a little drinky tonight.
I'm a doctor, but I think I mentioned that. OB-GYN.
What's the question nobody's asking? Why that building? Why not the Federal Building?
Not according to the men in blue.
They want to discredit you -- for what?
You mean that apocalyptic trash you write? I knew your name was familiar. I just didn't know why.
How?
Yeah, well I don't have them all.
I've been using you?!
Where are you, Scully?
You're looking for a bomb.
Something sweet.
I'm in the vending room.
Thirteen fifty nine, thirteen fifty eight, thirteen fifty seven...
Hang on. I'm gonna get you out of there.
Because they wanted me to invalidate your work, your investigations into the paranormal. But I think this goes deeper than that.
They're not doing this, Mulder.  I left behind a career in medicine because I thought I might make a difference at the FBI. When they recruited me they told me women made up nine percent of the bureau. I felt this was not an impediment, but an opportunity to distinguish myself. But it hasn't turned out that way. And now, if I were to be transferred to Omaha, or Wichita or some field office where I'm sure I could rise, it just doesn't hold the interest for me it once did. Not after what I've seen and done.
I thought you may have gotten drunk and decided to come here to talk me out of quitting.
According to this tag.
There's some kind of cellular breakdown. It's completely edematous.
We're being blamed for these deaths. Scully, I want to know what this man died of. Don't you?
I wasn't planning on it. Particularly after spending a half hour in cold storage this morning. But I got a better look at the blood and tissue samples I took from the firemen.
It looks pretty green for this climate.
You saved me, Scully.  As different and frustrating as it's been sometimes, your goddamn strict rationalism and science have saved me a thousand times; have kept me honest and made me whole. I owe you so much, Scully, and you owe me nothing.  I don't want to do this without you. I don't know if I can. If I quit now, they win.
That area is currently off limits to anyone other than authorized medical personnel.
I don't have his number.
How deep does this go?
Yes.
A weak vaccine against the virus Agent Scully has been infected with. It must be administered with ninety six hours.
What do you mean, walked?
We've been forced to reassess our role in Colonization by new facts of biology which have presented themselves.
The geometry of mass infection presents certain conceptual re-evaluations for us. About our place in their Colonization.
In hope of what? Learning that it's true?! That we are nothing more than digestives for the creation of a new race of alien lifeforms?!
And if it doesn't? By cooperating now we're but beggars to our demise! Our ignorance was in cooperating with the Colonists at all.
Well, without a cure for the virus, we're nothing more than digestives anyway.
Almost.  Mocky-Lock showed up.
Lucien Baines?
Why not?  Just once.  A trial run.  What harm could it do?
Okay.
He needs to be turned over.
Thanks Miriam.  Say hi to Henry and...
As far as I needed.
Okay.  Let's assume he wanted you to find him, that some part of him hated what he was doing... Most likely, that part is dead.  Schizophrenics with Whalen's Infraction sever all ties with the real world.  I'm sorry, I really am.
It doesn't have much to do with science.
Peter, okay?
Just like we all have fantasies, right? Things only we know, that we don't share.
What did you see?
You're the shrink, you tell me.
What difference does it make...?
Okay, okay...
Yep.  Eloped.
I told you.  You have to be optimistic. Believe in them...
All yours.  My boss says it's one of the strangest requests the Bureau's ever had.
I got it.
No problem.
"Mocky-Lock is the bogeyman.  Mocky-Lock wants me where I am."
Just graduated law school.  Single mom. Had a two-year-old daughter.
That hoist, with the winch...
You're kidding me.
Pump in two liters of pure oxygen, please Henry.
Stargher is in custody.  The functional equivalent of being under arrest. Normally, we'd Mirandize him, and if he didn't lawyer up, we'd interrogate him. But because of his condition, he doesn't have the capacity to waive those rights.
Damn, man, I give up.  Your partner tells you his wife's gonna have a baby, and all you care about is a coroner's report!
She remembers because it was her "dream truck."  Wanted one just like it.
Tell you what.  If this thing burns us, I take that heat.  I give you permission to point your finger at me and say "It was all his idea."
Das mussen sie doch wissen. Ich meine ohne grund wird die politzei doch nicht ins Hans komme Fraulein Schmidt, ein schande...
Sit down.
Well, if I do find out something, can I look you up again?
Whiskey.
Yes. He moved his head, but the rest is good, isn't it?
Sssh. Don't. Don't, please.
Just another part I've got to learn.
In German?
Comedy. I don't play tragedy.
Where is she?
Yes.
I knew him for twenty years - at least I thought I knew him. I suppose he was laughing at fools like us all the time.
Oh...
I'm sorry.
From Kurtz. They have just been arrested. But Harry won't come, he's not a fool.
Thank you.
Yes.
They're Harry's.
You won't learn anything from them. They are only love letters. There are not many of them.
No.
Two weeks ago.
I'm sorry - I don't seem able to understand anything you say. He's alive now this minute - he's doing something.
Well, I'll be saying good night. Good night, Miss.
Can I have that woman's passport?
No.
What?
What are you trying to say?
Calloway - I'm English, not Irish.
Calloway.
You're not locking her up?
As soon as I get to the bottom of this, I'll get the next plane.
Calloway, you haven't shown me one shred of evidence.
Bring him in.
Well?...
How about the doorway?
Yes, yes, yes, and then he vanished out there, I suppose with a puff of smoke and like a clap of...
We'll never get him in the Russian zone.
I'll be your dumb decoy duck.
I'll do what I can, if she'll let me.
Well, there's not much time.
I haven't got a sensible name, Calloway.
You know, Paine's one of your devoted readers. He's promised...
Please hurry up - just get him on the telephone.
I'll look it up for you.
Yes, Cultural re-education Section Propaganda. Very important in a place like this. We do a little show each week. Last week we did "Hamlet" and the week before we had something...
Oh, I thought you would know, you're a writer. Of course you do. Good night, old man.
It's good to see you, Holly.
She's been arrested.
You don't care anything at all about Anna, do you?
Don't try to be a policeman, old man.
Here?
What's the good of another post mortem? Suppose you dig up something - well - discreditable to Harry?
But you will.
Yes.
English?
You saw it?
You don't mean that doctor?
Now, hold on.
What else?
Okay.
Help you out?
Look I don't care about the money right now: I just want some sleep. So if you could be quiet -
Traveler.
I don't think so.
Nice work.
One or two kilometers.
Why?
What!
What idiot would lend him money? It would disappear.
It's on an island that no one get to.
Not too bad.
No.
So on one you are rich, on another poor. On one you are a murderer, on another the victim.
Richard, you know something -
Where did you lose it?
What are you doing here, I thought you were a Nazi.
They sound like you.
He's an asshole.
Read <i>Mein Kampf</i>? Hitler had all his best ideas in prison.
Danny, it's true. There were no six million. At most, two hundred thousand Jews died in the camps. And the majority of them were from disease and --
I don't, but...
Fire...
Actually, I think this moment has possibilities that --
Disease? What disease?
I stole it. From a synagogue.
Oh, yeah... 
Why?
Vuv...Zayin...Chet...Tet...
Don't curse in front of it.
Is that why you became a Nazi? So you could talk about Jews incessantly?
I doubt it. How did you find out?
Who's Eichmann?!!?
I'm stealing it.
He's Jewish? Manzetti?
No, but deep down, beneath the "tolerance" they learn on television, nothing's changed. The very word makes their skin crawl.  It isn't even hate, really. It's more the way we feel when a rat runs across the floor. We want to step on it. Crush it. We don't even know why. It's a physical reaction. Everyone feels it.
Isn't that what we want? Germany all over again? Only done right this time...
A week or so. There's something I want to do here first.
Sexuality??? What do you mean?
What??!?
Why?
Danny, what makes you think you know all this?
Of course they're Jews.
He says you were bar mitzvahed there, in March 1988.
Do you know who you're fucking with here?
To discredit me. Because I know who they are. Look, I thought I explained it to you. Those people can say or do anything. And they will. It's all narrative to them, it's... Are you going to print what this guy said?
It's slander. It's reckless disregard. I'll sue you and your fucking Jew paper.
No.
What were you, following me?
Get the fuck away from me.
You mean the <i>Times</i> guy?
With the shoes... There was more than one?
The truth doesn't mean anything to you, does it?
It's German.
Lina, you said if I was going to plant a bomb, I should --
I'm not here to talk about religious law, if you don't like --
Then he couldn't be bitter about living alone.
A Jewish prayer.
You could do it.
You look right through him. He's there, but there's something on the other side of him that you want. It's all you want. And whatever's in the way doesn't matter.... Then it's easy.
Green dot -- shotgun powder. For pipe bombs.  A guy in a lumberyard gave it to me. A donation to the cause.
What...?
Here...
No, it's weird, man. Nobody knows where he went.
I'm not hungry.... Come on, let's drive around.... We don't want to be spotted here.
Keep driving. Don't slow down.
So what do we do with the device?
Where?
Just do it.
...We have nothing to learn from these people. They should learn from us.
Dennis Leary.
And that's when the Mets started to stink.
What?
Eat shit....
Curtis is always more complicated than he seems. Even now.
... I'm pregnant, Bonita!
I can't... I just don't know how to...
But your man isn't quite a God!
Sorry.  Of course not, definitely not... well, maybe a little.  What did you say?
Like a popsicle.  They're keeping him on a stick until spring.
We have to send somebody over there immediately!  If we prove the forgery we can cancel the policy. We'll be off the hook.  There's a flight to Rome in two hours and from there its just a short hop to Sicily.
Remember when I went to Italy and canceled the policy on the new stadium.  Well, we weren't being cheated by the Mafia or anybody except maybe by me...  ... Do they come for lunch everyday? I really went on my own business, to see a man that I happen to be in love with... and I'm glad I did it, but I'm sorry about the policy and I'll be happy to make up the money the company didn't get... of course just now I don't have...  One million, four hundred and ten thousand dollars.  But if you were to dock my salary, say, twenty dollars a week, in a few hundred years we'd be even... and I think this is where you fire me?
What was he like, when he was little?
Italy!
What are you doing here?
No.  Jacques is a creature of the sea.  He isn't meant to live on earth, among us... You should know this, Johana.
You really think so?  Did you tell him you were pregnant?
You're going to hold me up at a time like this?
Six seconds.
Then tell him to wax it too.
A rosary for Mama, a dress for
Very chic.  Anyway, you don't have anything else, do you?
I'm meditating, can't you see? Jacques does two hours of yoga before going down.  I can take a five minute nap, can't I?
The rules are the rules.
Hey!  D'you have any other complaints?  Just make a list and we'll stick it on the porthole! Okay?
Not only is Jacques Mayol a very special friend, but he happens to be one of the best divers in the world!  And you're throwing him out!  Are you crazy, or what? Stupido!
... You married?
What?
Ahi, ahi, cazzo!  Ma mamia! Where...?  God, she'll kill me...  ... if she catches me eating pasta in a restaurant.
... For the mermaids.
Look at me.  These aren't lungs. These are... Tanks.  How long can you hold your breath?
Because pasta should be eaten "Al Dente".  So the trinket will just have to wait a bit.
The dolphins aren't the only ones who don't feel very good sometimes.
I can't.
Yeah... Sure... Is this your first trip to Peru?
Who?
I was doing an insurance investigation in Palermo.  I work for an insurance company.  So, I decided to take a few days off.  I don't know this island at all. It really is gorgeous.
I thought it was a nice place.  Isn't it?
Thank you...
I did?
Why?
I'm not from the sea... I don't understand what you're talking about.
But it's not true, I feel good with you... It feels right...
It's me... Johana.
... Not at all.
Uncle Louis.  He's a 75 year old amazing guy, isn't he?
I don't know... it didn't feel right.  I'm going to bed.  I'm tired.
Because you have to find a good reason to come back up again... And I always have a hard time finding one.
... Are you sure?
Uncle Louis, we have a guest!
Don't be a jerk.  There's no such thing as love at first sight.
Do you think I should have stayed? Don't you think maybe I should have stayed?  I've been a jerk, right?  I should have stayed!  I was supposed to be in love... I was in love!  I am in love, why did I act like a bitch?  He went swimming. All the man did was go swimming! I must be crazy.  It was too good to be true.
That isn't for the divers actually. It's for the balloon.  It blows up and pulls the diver up like an elevator.  Without it, with the pressure at the bottom, the diver would just stay pinned to the sea bed.
Mayol... Jacques Mayol.
But... how is he going to breathe?
Why is he doing this?
Okay, okay.  You'll have it by the end of the week, how's that?
Hey, it's your Bar Mitzvah. I'm just readin' the Torah portion.
I love her sir. If I don't help you, I won't be able to make her my wife. Mohammed Ali Paula Abdul Rahim has agreed to come with me to the North Pole on a rescue mission.
Well, I couldn't be happier for the both of you.
He must be behind that curtain. Relax. We're undercover. We need to give off the appearance of calm. You see Esther, the trick to undercover work is to try and blend in. Act as a Gentile would.
Now we wait for Santa to make his next move.
I said, yeah, about once a week!
Keep going.
Kiss me you Semitic stud!
I'm sorry Esther, I just don't think we can see each other romantically anymore.
I forgive you.
Mordechai!
Mordechai!
I can see. And you also brought a nice girl to come eat by us.
Mom, stop with this already. Of course I love you. You're my mother.
When I play bridge with all the girls, everyone has what to talk about with their sons. They show pictures. Their sons are lawyers and doctors and Rabbis. Why can't I show a picture?
Mom, why don't you put that cat out of its misery?
Yeah, I'm going to be out of the office from 1:30 to 3:00 on Sunday. I have a terrible yeast infection and I need to see my gynecologist.
Now this might get a bit technical, but try and stay with me. Using a highly sophisticated connection of other computators, called the Internet, I can access surveillance maps, villian biographical information, and even sports scores with a few simple keystrokes of this electronic typewriter.
If you keep your mouth shut and come with me, you won't get hurt.
I'm just calming the kiddies.  There's no need to worry about Santa. He's just having a peaceful, adult conversation with his nice Jewish friend, The Hebrew Hammer.
In fact, he's just informed me that he personally plans on cancelling Christmas this year.
Hah! Jewish guilt. Well, it won't work on me Hammer. I'm too strong for it.
While I was in Taiwan negotiating the solution to our labor problems, I came across a factory that illegally manufactures the most addictive, Jewish pride weakening substance on the planet. I bought the entire plant.
Oh, that's the beauty of it. These are free samples.
Who's Carlos Dom-what's-his-name?
Good looking?
You know -- not scared enough. Nothing to scare it.
Look, Charlie, just be patient. I'll fix everything. You don't want that cat, anyway. It killed two people.
They all say the cat killed this second girl.
Yes, I was drunk, Mr. Manning.
Look, Charlie, you didn't do it, and you know you didn't.
Who?
What are you doing that for?
Go on --
Let me see it --
Hey -- I'm over here.
Well, now that you've had your history lesson, I think I'll get on to the museum.
Of course. It's the way any decent man would feel in your position.
Yes?
Sure -- certainly -- but what's that got to do with this?
Couldn't you tell a man like that when you saw him?
There's a little museum here in town. They've hired me to run it, We've some interesting exhibits of Indian arts and crafts. It's fun -- and I like living here in New Mexico.
That was a calamity!
No -- really, I can see them -- they're coming now -- turn off the lights --
Thanks, Sheriff.
Go on foot.
I know all that, chief, and I don't like it any better than you do, but there's something else --
You think Galbraith found the leopard on the day you went out with the posse.
Listen, Kicks, you'll never guess what I've cooked up this time.
No. I thought that might be just a little corny.  I want you to lead him in on a leash.
And I never will -- you know what's between us -- we're a thing -- But this is serious -- big competition.
Don't be soft.
And I suppose you don't feel bad!
The whole town's in a state, Kiki --doors locked, people huddling together like scared sheep --nobody on the streets at night --
Forget it. I'm buying a drink for a fellow who was on the posse with me, a nice guy. Come along he'll get a great kick out of meeting you.
Do they close up every year for this Processionist business?
Maybe I want to feel badly.
Half to the Delgado family and half to Clo-Clo's family.
We will --
It's all right. I'm not hurt.
I know. What do you think I felt when you said, "don't be soft?"
I don't know. He seems to delight in so much sisterly love, he might become determined.
Can it be that you want your brother found?
Disney! How inter...
Where is it?  He. The boy you said my brother bought! Where is he?
Oh no. You'll have to do better than that, Mr Lombard.
The question now is whether or not your brother still owns anything, Mrs De Moraes.
Perhaps I should come back when you're...
Why me, Mrs De Moraes? Why should such well-connected people as you hire a small- time French detective to look for their missing son, Mrs De Moraes?
Last night you upset my sleep. Tonight my social life. We have two minutes. My dinner guests are waiting.
W-why are you telling me all this, Mr Lombard?
Yes... You woke me up... It's the middle of the night here. Have you found Mr Friedman?
Sorry?
Have you finished?
Why do I feel I needn't answer that?
I didn't know who or what had happened to my brother yet, Mr Lombard!
Something like that.
I didn't intend it that way... It just happened.  He heard from Laurence that you'd been back.  That we'd argued. He asked why and it just happened; I told him everything... I couldn't help it. Wanted to see him scared. I had never seen him scared before, you see...
He... He is dead!  MY HUSBAND IS DEAD!  Call my parents. They'll tell you. Call them!
Your flunkey said he was expected back tonight.
Get to the point, will you...
You wouldn't understand.
Yes. I'm trying to reach a friend but I can't get through. The number is 01766 770 471.
A coffee and a couple of croissants.
Croissants. Like that...
Not in America, sir. You must be from Europe.  So, black coffee and a couple of crescents.
I'm fine standing, thank you.
Well, I'd sooner mug an old lady...
Lombard...  It will take a few days for the things I need to get here. Meanwhile I'd sooner not draw police attention walking the streets like a hungry dog...
I know where to look.
Hah... What about Nathalie?
How come you're alive? Child traffickers usually achieve what they set out to do.  What am I really looking at here, huh?  Are you really not just a lousy private eye? Am I really looking at some kind of cunning dispenser of justice in disguise?
Yeah. Goodnight, Emily.
Have you found your man? Is that where he is?
Who's the guy? Who's the guy! Nom de Dieu!  Had the guy got a closer look at you or your number plate I'd have had to kill him.
She'll be alright. She's tough...
What about an untrained pup, white...
... Fine. I'll go for the safe place.
You... Fuck you!
Where is the Austrian? Is Friedman the Austrian?
F-five. The Wilsons and their three kids. They run the place. Look, man, I've got to get to...
I'll call again.
I certainly did, sir...
That are called Rommel or something, I guess not that many. 
Oh yeah! Better be good and hurry away then! Who knows? We might be being watched! Maybe one of your stupid French companies has got a detective prying into your life - after all, that's what they do to their employees, isn't it? Huh! Hope you enjoy ruining people's lives. Thanks for the lift!
Bye bye, Jane. And don't be naughty.
Thanks for cleaning my flat and sending my money, all right?... Come on, I need you. It's important.
Well, I would have to point out that we could have dealt with that question when you called this morning, Mrs Spitz. I wouldn't like to think I'd kept you waiting for nothing.
Didn't you say I came recommended?  That's what I thought. May I know by whom?
Leonard. What my daughter is on about, Mr Lombard, is that Leonard is somewhat of a Bohemian. You might as well know that...
Yesterday. It all looked normal.
No. And before you ask, no, he's not gay! He has had girlfriends, but nothing serious...
Plus a trust fund to provide for the boy's education.
We conclude our transaction.
No. In Hampstead... Why?
Who are you? Who are you working for, huh?
I don't recollect mentioning a friend.
I'll be alone.
Reach for it and throw it to me. And... My finger's on the trigger, you hear!
Should I be?
Can I get up now?
As you know from speaking to Phil, your friend Leon has disappeared, Rhian. His family have hired me to find him.
Did Leon tell you why he didn't want the police involved, Rhian?
My sister... She lives in the next valley.
Yes...You-you're not going to take Shiva away?
Er... Yes...
He... Apparently the hostility was all hers. Leon didn't... It hurt him. They used to be close...  Their parents were in their forties when they were born, you see. And mostly away. They grew up in a Scottish mansion with old nannies and servants. He... ?Our world was so old and cold, we shone for one another,? Leon used to say. His sister cut him off after she got married. He never understood why but thought it was because she had no children. Was bitter...
... No. In fact, I'd seen him a couple of months earlier. He was quite depressed. His work wasn't getting anywhere. He said he was going to try something new, realism, London in the nineties - documentary stuff, you know...
No...
I... How long have I been here?
I'd appreciate it if I could use your phone.
Fucked-up fucking weird.
Un Autrichien. Negociant en pr?- pubescents.
Eh bien... T'es s?r que t'as besoin de moi?  La petite m'a l'air assez bien foutue, non?
If you can, send me a receipt.
Who?  I don't know who the fuck you're talking about, sunshine.
Gluck's dead, you sonofabitch!
The acid bath?
I can only tell you what he told us...
Some guy called to let him know the Frenchman who'd called the night before he left London was in L.A. looking to kill him. He did his sums and decided to take the call seriously.
Shut up and walk...
What's that? A word?
My lord, I'm not sure that...
Jeanne's been badly injured!  She jumped from the top of a tower into a frozen moat!
But not impossible... Gilles and La Hire are ready to risk everything to save her...
No.  I see the hand of Tremoille, and Regnault, and Yolande, and you... and they are dirty hands.
Right.  Raymond... a priest.
Yes, I am.  I'm an archer who can read and write.  Who do you want to write to?
How dare you stop me doing God's will!
Well...
Yes.  Yes, I'm fine...  We need more brushwood!  Why are you staring at me like that?
Maybe their silence is a sign...? Maybe it's a sign to go home?
Did your voices tell you that?  You told me you hadn't heard them for months...
Or maybe it's Jeanne who's in a trap -- her own trap -- a downward spiral that she can't stop?
If God wants me to win, he will find a way.  And if he wants me to die... if he wants me back... then that's fine too.  Then I'll be with him forever.
It would not be the same without you.
Not yet!
I -- I don't understand...
I'm staying, Jean.
I'm fed up with taking her orders. She swore she'd defeat the English before nightfall, instead of which she goes and plays the fool and gets herself nearly killed!  Look at the mess we're in!  That's her mess, not mine...!  We're worse off then if she'd never come at all!  ... now do as I say and Sound the Retreat!
Ah, yes, I forgot... God sent us an illiterate peasant to carry out such an important mission!  Do you think that God made the right decision, to take an ignorant girl to save the kingdom of France?
Quite a few.
Yes...
Then perhaps the temptation to kill would have been stronger... too strong perhaps...?
... so you were in the middle of the battlefield, with your sword in your hand, waving it above your head... charging against the enemy, screaming and yelling... fighting for your life... and you want us to believe that in the middle of all this excitement you never killed anyone?
We want her burned as a witch!
How can I calm down when I'm made the laughing-stock of the whole court?!  I've had enough!
Where... where am I?
And God who allowed you to be caught?
No no, I'm fine, really...
I will hear you... but not now, not here.
Pierre Cauchon, Bishop of Beauvais. As you were captured in my diocese, the duty of conducting the trial falls upon me.
Yes.  They paid your ransom... tomorrow you will be transferred to their great castle at Rouen.
Nineteen... or thereabouts...
These questions have nothing to do with your trial.
Many things...
Yes...
So it is the Church Militant that refuses to confess me, and so prevents me from being a good Christian?
And may I go to Mass?
You have nothing to regret...
I understand.  How much?
You did well...
... You look wonderful...
Well... we are, of course, enormously grateful for your past efforts, but your task is done.  Now it's time for negotiation... and after many months of skillful work, our dear Tremoille is about to seal a treaty with our Burgundian friends who will no longer lend their support to the English.  You see, my dear Jeanne... as it is written in the Bible, "to everything there is a season:  a time for war, and a time for peace"...
Yes.
I'm more interested in what he says, not what he looks like.
That's not a lot.
I know... but the English want her very badly, and I have to tell you that they are proving much more generous.
He's on the other side of the river.
For what?
God.
Not yet.
Calm yourself, Xaintrailles.  Now slowly.  Who has finally done what?
That'll put fire in my soldiers!
Me too...
No good?  This is a disaster!
Maybe... I don't know... but first we have to confess...
I know, but so is the enemy -- they're falling back -- Paris is ours...!
The clothes are not important...
Yes, but...
No!
Hey, my friend!  I'm glad to see your ugly damn face again!
Then, Lord Dunois, show me the way to the other side of the river...
My king.
I -- I -- I...
I am that I am.  You don't like my face?  Maybe you prefer this one...
No... no... I'm just a messenger... He needs me... a higher calling...
WHO ARE YOU TO DECIDE IF YOU SHOULD LIVE OR DIE?
Nothing.  I'm here to set you free...
How can you pretend that you love God when you're about to throw away the most precious thing he gave you? Life is a gift, you should know that by now Jeanne -- a gift from God. You know what He'd say to you, if He was here?  "What are you doing to me, Jeanne?"
No, no... I'm just so tired, and lost, and... I didn't realize what I was doing!
I don't understand.  What do you want from me?
I want to see that.  Do you mind if I stay... on the side?  I won't bother you.
What do you mean, they won't come?
Because!  Because I've always been faithful to God, and I've followed everything he said... and I've done everything he asked me...
But... it didn't just get there by itself.
Oh?  You can't remember?  Let me help your memory...
Really?
Why are you doing this to me??  Do you get pleasure from hurting me?
What for?
Do you think this cross will protect you?
Yes... of course... when you don't need me anymore.
Are you willing to follow all His commandments?
No...
There's no sin in charity, Jeanne.
Whose were they?
Oh yes, my sister's just... she's... wonderful.
Well, I try and talk to him, but mostly he's the one who does the talking.
And what does he say to you?
Jeanne, be patient.
Yes.
I didn't want to come, I didn't want to see all this, but I couldn't stop myself.
He'll be back before curfew.
Dead.
What are you doing?
Yes, but sometimes I'm still not sure which side of the wall I'm on.
Where do you want me to go?  Look at me. No, no, I'm not leaving. Can't I take my chances here?
Thanks.
Oh, you need me now, yes, now you need me!
Then there's nothing I can do. He should've joined us when I gave him the chance..
Who told you?
Do they?
Your work, yes, playing the piano for all the parasites in the ghetto, they don't give a damn about people's sufferings, they don't even notice what's going on around them!
Warsaw's not the only radio station.
That makes a change.
Just shut up.
No. Three hundred and sixty thousand, so it'll be easy.
Well, you know what's funny? You're funny with that ridiculous tie.
You're mad, that's your trouble, you're mad.
should never have come out. I should've stayed there, fought with them.
Yes, but what good did it do?
There are always notices going up.
Not this week.
Fine, we're fine in the circumstances. But I can guess what you've called about. There's nothing we can do; they won't reopen the station--
Cow!
You're a dirty pig!
It's easy to get out, it's how you survive on the other side that's hard.
Pack, Wladek, there's no time.
God forbid!
We're getting out.
Tell me your name. I'll listen out for you.
Szpilman.  Good name for a pianist.
It will be very dramatic.
... without a shred of manners.
No sound at all?
There is something to be said for silence
Baines is packing up?
No, no bible readers.
She's stunted, that's one thing.
The piano.
Te, kawnarna paraikete mo te tahi hawlie 0 te whenna uci.  UNSUBTITLED
I don't want to learn.
No, not words.
What are they?
I'm sorry, I can't do that.  I don't have the time.  Goodbye
You've missed this bit.
He'll probably fall down.
Billie.  You ready?
He won't know you're carryin' it. C'mon, you gotta help me out.
What do we do?
I got twenty or so in here tonight. Take your pick.
I checked the place out.  There weren't no dicks in there.
You think my play is bad?
What are you talkin' about?  We just took off the biggest score we've ever had.  We can do anything we want now.
They didn't think he'd be so cagey, that's all.  They'll get him next time.
He's not comin' in.  Not to get bounced off a job anyway.
We'll be waitin'.
Which way did he do, Eirie?
Which one?
You sure he didn't just pocket it?
What do ya want the others to get?
You sober?
He had you down as a big-timer. What happened?
Well we got some workin' money anyway.
He'll show.
He wants to put a half million on Syphon.
We'll give him the hook on the train, and play him here.  You think I can get in that poker game, Eddie?
Lonnegan.
Raise 5,000.
Too many people coulda seen ya go in her room.  She was a professional. Used to work in the Dutch Schultz gang.
Don't have much choice, do ya?
Then you'll have to come up with another grand somewhere.
What for?  I haven't done anything.
But I got a train to make.
No.
What the hell for?
No.  They're just the only ones we know of.
He hired a dame to take it from ya.
Then why the rat?
I was afraid you weren't gonna come. We haven't got much time.
Sometime after 1:00 a guy's gonna call here and give you the name of a horse.  All you do is take this two grand across the street to Shaw's place and bet it on that pony.  There's nothin' to it, but don't take too much time.  We only have 3 or 4 minutes after you get the call.
This is just a test.  The big one comes later.  Be careful with that though, it's all I got.
Why don't ya then.
You want your money back?  Try and get it in a court of law.  C'mon, don't be a sorehead.  I'll make it worth your while.  Migth even help ya finance the big play if this one works out.
He's right, Les.
I'll make parole.
I need more proof, that's all. Anybody can get lucky once.
If it works again tomorrow, I'll have a half million in cash here by noon the next day.  We split 60-40.
With 20% coming off the top for me laying your bet.  Either way you end up with 40.
We missed him.
Only rents by the month.  Two hundred and fifty for the two of them.
Yeh, but I don't know where he is.
What the hell good is Hooker to ya?
I'm sorry.
I can't find him.  I've tried everything.  I thought you might know.
I won't have you hounding him any more for money.
I didn't say I would.  But we've got to have money.
Nonsense! She got at she deserved.
Thanks...  we're taking your cab.
He wouldn't say.
Yes.
Disappeared!
Macaulay.
We're at the Normandie for a couple of weeks.  Why don't you drop around?
I've got to see you alone!
Which way did she fall?
What would your mother say to that?
Wouldn't it be a little embarrassing ...  all of us there ...  your other and me and your stepfather?
A new invention?
We were planning to be married right after Christmas.
And he still wants to marry me!
We hear this is getting to be sort of a meeting place for the Wynant family, so we figure we'll stick around in case the old man himself shows up.  Then we seen him...  ...sneak in and we decide to come up.  And pretty lucky for you.
I'm asking you.
Let's go and see.  Taxi!
Nunheim!
Lucky thing for us they weren't in that lime.
I never saw him.  I don't think anyone saw him.
No.
Because I found out for certain that he didn't commit the murders.
Well, what?
When was that?
Good morning, Lieutenant -  Sorry.
Maybe if you quit running around after other women you wouldn't have so much trouble with this one.
Want to take a poke at him?
You don't think I had anything to do with it?
Why don't you go to see Julia? She handles his money.
He's not anybody.  Just a fellow I used to know.
Oh yes.  Why, you told me to sell them a long time ago.
But suppose some business comes up...
Hello, Macaulay.  Come in.
My wife's father died and left her a lumber mill and a narrow guage railroad and a couple of other things.  And I'm looking after them.
What's all the fuss about? Is he in hiding?
No word at all?
Slim.
He gave me a code message to insert in the Times, in case I wanted to get in touch with him.
What do you think?
Now, Mimi, there are a thousand detectives in New York.  Hire one of them.
I tell you again, I don't want any part of it.  Now you take Dorothy home and...
You should have told them he'd disappeared.
He didn't say very much.  Wanted to know how I was and how the children were.
Do you mind putting that gun away? My wife doesn't care, but I'm in a delicate condition.
He's all right. He'd like to see you. But listen...  What's the law doing to me?  Do they think I did it, or is it just something else to pin on me?
That'd be very smart.  That'd be the smartest thing I ever did. Me that a police captain's been in a hospital three weeks on account we had an argument.  The boys would like to have me come in and ask questions.  They'd like it right down to the end of their blackjacks. Now I come to you on the level. Studsy says you're on the level. Be on the level.
She brought it in.  Trying to make me believe she did it.
Nothing, 'til I find out if it's the gun Julia Wolf was killed with.  Keep her in here, and don't let those reporters see her. They might believe her.
Maybe a drink would help you.
You'll have to keep them anyway. The man at the Aquarium said that he wouldn't take them back.
I'll get some towels. 
I'm stifling, but it's so pretty.  The Kirbys.
Yes.
What's the matter with you?
Catch me letting you go alone!
I'll be all right.  I've got Asta to protect me.
You wouldn't be a widow long.
My soul, woman.  I give you three murders and you aren't satisfied.
It was his body that was buried there.
Yup.  Don't you want something to eat?
Several things.  Hello, Fred.  We're hungry again. Yeah, and lots of onions.  Oh, and coffee.
Oh.  Well, the clothes for instance. They were carefully preserved, and the body was just as carefully destroyed.  The person who killed him counted on one thing... that all skeletons look alike.
I can't help it. I can't tell a soul.  I didn't even tell Guild.
I want to lie low till I get the whole dope.  I don't want to go off half-cocked.
Mimi, Jorgensen, Morelli, Tanner..... 
I wish you'd tell me.
I'm afraid you're lying, Mimi. You see, I really did see Wynant last night.
Yes.  Nick!
Oh, yes -- yes -- that's right -- 
I'm fired.
You did.
Can you eat it?  If you can't eat it I really don't care what it is.
Damn, this is sweet.  We are going to be home in no time.
We shouldn't have been here, Epps.  There is a war going on!
Deserters would have run, they wouldn't have engaged.
Low on gas.  Got to refill.
He's an idiot, and he's not nearly as hard as he thinks.
And find the treasure, and get it, and get back to the Humvee, and get the hell out of Iraqi without getting our heads blown off, but that's about it.
I don't know.  There's a lot of space up here.  They could be just about--
Maybe we should split it up now.
What if we get separated?  Way I see it if something happens I want to be carrying my share.
You've had your say, Wes.  Now leave it.
I told you:  When I straighten someone out they stay straightened.  This is how it works:  Nobody touches the gold. Except when we're on the move and someone's carrying it, nobody so much as opens the pack to get an eyeful of it. Agreed?
He snuck in here thinking we were asleep, only I wasn't sleeping.  Would have slit our throats if I hadn't stopped him.
You don't know that.
He's an enemy soldier.
It's murder, and I won't be any part of it.
Tell me something, Wes.  Are you crazy, greedy, or just stupid?  Jaeger says you're crazy.
Knock it off!
Ready for what?  What are you supposed to be doing?
Wait.  Wait.
Christ!  Wes, tell him.  You know this stuff.
Yeah.  I meant... You know what I'm going to do with it?  I'm going to buy a Sixty- three 'Vette Stingray.  All tricked out and cherry.  I'm going to be so sweet.
We've got to do something.  We've got to turn around.
I'm just thinking, you know, if the rest of the boys knew what we're doing.  I mean if they knew what we were coming back with.
We're going to get off, all right.  We'll get you off of there.  Just...be cool.
Epps...
Epps, my leg is falling asleep.
It falls asleep and you die, so wake it the hell up.
Wes is right.  If there were any more mines we would have found them.  Hell, that one you stepped on was probably old anyway; left over from the war with Iran.
Just figure it's my map, I ought to hang on to it.
Yeah, I understand.  Wes doesn't want to come along in the first place, but he gets a third of the find.  That's a sweet deal.
What are they doing in the middle of nowhere?
The Shi'ites are on our side?  I didn't know that.
So good bye, Shi'ites.  Thanks for playing.  We have some lovely parting gifts for you as you go.
I hope it means something, otherwise...
Just stay down.
We're not going to do anything.
I feel air.  Probably opens up outside somewhere.  That's where the light comes from.  Couldn't see it with the lanternon.
Someone's got to send the gold up.  It can't get on the line by itself.
It stays as it is.  We're halfway home now.  Let's not blow it by people getting ideas.
Northeast?  That's away from the Hummer; further into Iraqi.
We'll find our way.
We'll find our way!  We'll...
Forget Wes.
Wes is dead!
What do you mean no?  They can fly us home.
If we can find the Hummer, or some friendlies by sundown we might be okay. We've got enough water for that.  But we won't make another day otherwise.
It's a desert.  That's what deserts do at night; they get cold.
Well, we should identify ourselves.
They must have thought we were Iraqi when you yelled to them.  They couldn't tell in the dark.
I don't have a weapon.
I just said I would.  I don't think I--
We can't stay here.  Even if that wasn't an Iraqi soldier it's only a matter of time before some show up.  Get all the water you can carry, and we'll head out on foot.
We keep going, that's what we do.  We ignore them, maybe they ignore us.
What if it hadn't been Wes?  What if...I mean, accidently, what if I had...
Somebody has to.
Yeah.
Thanks.
What?
I don't know.
I could use some recon photos too.
The photos.
They're all good ones.  Satellites we've got can snap a shot of the boil on Saddam's ass.
I thought it would be good to know.
What!?
What?
It's about a hundred miles from where we are now.  How long do you think it would take us to--
It's real.  I'm telling you, it's real.
Hell, we'll just buy our way out.
A car is not just a car where I come from.  I had this friend, had this wicked candy apple red Sixty-four and a half Mustang--
Oh, Jesus!
Probably would've too if Epps wasn't around to stop you.
All last night he could have been--
Probably shot a few.  Scattered the rest. Murderers.
triple three, triple three! easy.....
What?...Oh, no, THX.  That's not true.  Not satisfied?  THX, I need you so much.
But it's so hopeless...you're so beautiful.
No!  Don't go.
But...you...
You don't know.  You don't....
We could leave, and live in the superstructure....
No one can see us now we're alone.
It seems I am destined to endure many frustrations....but at the same time I am secure in the knowledge that the thrust of my studies has been in the right direction, and that even if it remains incomplete, my search has not been in vain.
We're leaving.
THX and me.
Impossible!
I wonder how far he went.  He's gathered invaluable information out there.
Ask him about the air.  He looks out of breath.
You have nothing to fear.  You're safe again.
Where is LUH?
Don't say that.  You look...  You're not well.
You know I have a way with the computers.  I can clear myself for any area.....almost.
I'm all right THX rises and they begin to walk along the passageway. At the end of the hall is a small metal door, a sign read "Level 842CON G, Division of Plastic, Vendable manufacturing stations" the door is jammed and it is difficult to open.  Finally the latch snaps and the door swings open.
Soon he'll be a plastic cube.
Where's LUH?
I did not accept any.  I...  I wanted... to.  But I didn't. You know I didn't.  Don't you?
My mate has been acting very strange.  I can't explain it.....but.  I haven't been feeling very well myself.  I don't know, maybe it's me.  I needed an SP9 last night.  I feel as if something odd were happening to me. Something....
Yes...
I'm looking for the Bomb Squad.
Officer Reilly, vice.
-Where?
Thanks.
Go ahead.
What do you mean?
Thanks.
We can start in the area where the robbery occurred.
That cop who bought it... you didn't tell us he was your partner.
This isn't bumper cars, it's brain surgery. You wanna work with us, you do it our way, understand?
Be cool around my men, they don't trust strangers. And try not to swear so much, it's unattractive.
Mike Reilly.
Then let's go see what they missed.
I don't know. You tell me?
Just how easy is it to build a... device?
Yep.
We've gotta be. In this business, you don't exactly make alot of outside commitments.
What?
Congratulations, you just built your first ticker.
He has a timer going as back-up, in case we got a hold of the remote.  Okay... first, run your fingers along the edges, feel for a sensor.
Don't touch that.
Stay to your left.
Okay, one of the caps turns it on, the other shuts it down.
When in doubt, pull the yellow wire.
Easy, guys.  
Call upstairs, see what you can find out.
T.J., run a trace on this, see if you can pin down where it came from. Whoever these people are, let's hope they're all talk.
Hope you don't mind, Captain, might help us catch these guys that much sooner.  Coming?
Let's get something straight. We're doing you a favor. You're not exactly a guy we want around explosives.
Helluva fuck factor.
Let's face it, we all knew it would happen sooner or later. The guy who can build a mousetrap that's better than we are ...
Nothing... just tired.
We're moving' on. I have to pick up the supplies. Just two little boxes.
Can it, Pluchinsky. And shove some cotton up your nose.
Look, it's important.
What kind of bomb was it?
Time for bed, kiddos. Say goodnight.
That'd be some explosive pussy he's got his hands on.
I don't know...
One of these days you're gonna get tired of fighting the shit. When that happens, you'll wish you had family.
She didn't work out, had to cut her loose.
Don't talk.
What?
Reilly, what the hell happened out there? Why didn't you call for back-up?
I thought I told you--
She's refused to say a word to anyone. What made you think you could get her to talk?
We'll keep him pinned in, you guys hurry up!
Diamonds all over.
A man in love, completely shaken. He sits on bed, thinks, then takes telephone slowly, decisively.
No!
About tonsils.
Goodbye, M'sieu Filiba. 
Constantinople?
You've never been in Constantinople?
But you <u>have</u> been in Venice?
Funny--the first time I saw him I thought he was a doctor!
Oh, yes ... Well, that's not so easy.  Beginnings are always difficult.
Yes, Baron.
But please, Baron. We're not supposed to breathe a word of it. You won't tell anybody I told you?
Just a second.
Um-hum!
M'sieu ...
M'sieu Monescu!
Now just a minute, Major--
No--no.
Someone from another world--so entirely different. One gets so tired of one's own class--princes and counts and dukes and kings--ah! And everybody talking shop--always trying to sell jewelry ... And then I heard your name and found you were just one of us.
No, thank you.
Not at all, Countess ... There's one very good stone in it.
And her <u>jewelry</u> is worth a fortune!
Beautiful. And what of it?  Let me tell you something: so far as I'm concerned, her whole sex appeal is in that safe!
Yes--Filiba! Venice--Grand Hotel-- room two fifty-three--
Spanish passports?
<u>Grossartig</u>--<u>kolossal</u>!
That's what I'm here for--to get out! I want to get away from here, from you--as fast as I can and as far as a hundred thousand francs will take me.  Sixty-five, ninety-four--
Thirty-five to the left--sixty- three, eight ... I wouldn't fall for another man if he were the biggest crook on earth ... Seventy-six, eighty-four, fifty-five--  What has she got that I haven't got?
Lily-- 
Well--I am Madame Colet.
The pleasure is mine, madame.
M'sieu Laval!
What's wrong now?
No, no, no!  I disagree with you completely! I tried it once--
It <u>is</u> beautiful. But I got a little tired of sleeping in antiques, so I gave it to my secretary.
What would you do if you were my <u>secretary</u>?
And so will M'sieu Giron.
Um-hum ...
Um-hum ...
Hair?
Lipstick?
<u>Now</u>, <u>let</u> <u>me</u> <u>tell</u> <u>you</u>--
I <u>must</u> go.
Um-<u>hum</u> ...
Please!  Thank you.
I'll do my best, madame, even if I have to work every night.
Ever had a romance with a crook?
I don't want your money!
Because I hate him--because I love you!
The pumps --
The ship will sink.
I'm sorry that I didn't build you a stronger ship, young Rose.
Rose Calvert.
This is ridiculous, Lovejoy. Find her.
Honestly, Cal, if you weren't forever booking everything at the last instant, we could have gone through the terminal instead of running along the dock like some squalid immigrant family.
She knows.
You're wrong. They're fascinating. Like in a dream... there's truth without logic. What's his name again...?  Picasso.
You wanted to see the propellers?
Rose is displeased. Mmm... what to do?
I was tired.
I see you had that undertaker of a manservant follow me.
That's right. Two things dear to me have disappeared this evening. Now that one is back...  ...I have a pretty good idea where to find the other.  Search him.
Not the better half.
Rose... your mother and I have been looking for you --
What do I tell your mother?
Almost as good as you.
Porca Madonna!! YEEAAAAA!!!
Bollocks.
We got room for lots more. I say we go back.
I prefer not to push the engines until they've been properly run in.
Excuse me.
Well, here you are.
Is he your boyfriend?
I see you.
You wouldn'ta jumped.
Well, then logging got to be too much like work, so I went down to Los Angeles to the pier in Santa Monica. That's a swell place, they even have a rollercoaster. I sketched portraits there for ten cents a piece.
Time for my coach to turn back into a pumpkin.
I like that. Aren't we supposed to wish on it?
Sssshh. Come here.
Should I be expecting him anytime soon?
He's an ex-Pinkerton. Cal's father hired him to keep Cal out of trouble... to make sure he always got back to the hotel with his wallet and watch, after some crawl through the less reputable parts of town...
I didn't.  I just realized I already knew.
Get in the boat, Rose.
It's so cold.
It was a dreadful, heavy thing.  I only wore it this once.
I'm afraid I'm feeling a little tired, Mr. Lovett.
You had it the entire time?!
How can you put this on my shoulders?
Don't be crazy--I'm tickled to death to see you.
I'll join you later.
You mind your own business! She's an old friend of mine and I like her--what're you going to do about it?
Thanks, no. I despise any form of exercise.  Don't forget we have an engagement for cocktails and cards.
Montana?
<U>Gladly</U>.
No!--Did <U>you</U> take that bracelet?
We'll be expecting you.
Sure!  Excuse me.
Oh, no--I played with <U>your</U> cards--in <U>your</U> cabin--at <U>your</U> suggestion--If you've got a kick coming, make it to the Purser.
So you washed it off!
Good-by.
You're not very ambitious, are you?
You <U>are</U> a lunatic!
Keep your eyes on the ball, Mister.
At seven-thirty?
Wrong again--  But I dislike possessive women.
I think we'll live in Europe after we're married?
I'll be waiting on deck.
We didn't have enough dough for two tickets, did we?
Shortie, look!
How're the tips?
Why <U>didn't</U> I think of that?--I am going to scout around and see if I can find her.
You take some awful chances.
Thank you.  I owe you a dollar forty--here--keep the change.
I'll take one. 
Get it!
Don't worry about that.  We'll settle after the hand. Out in Montana where I come from a man's word is all that's necessary. What have you got?
Yours, too. Are you the McKinney, the dentist on Calumet Avenue in Chicago?
Sorry--but I'm on a vacation--
No, thanks--I'll take a walk around the deck and then turn in--
Why?
Sure, I'll go.
How about trying your fine Italian hand?
Hey!--you're tickling me.
You keep out of this--  You admit you thought of killing him--how were you going to do it?
Why, I--
Now that that's settled, why not make the game a foursome?
Tell you what I'll do.  I'll toss you for her--heads she plays with me.
Wait a minute--let's match for it.
I would--but our rehearsal starts right away.  Before I go I want to ask you a little favor. Sally is an important part of my show. Some day--not now--when you get a chance--let her come to just one rehearsal. I'll appreciate it.
What's that?
That's right. I owe you a dollar sixty.
Back is in New York.
June? That's my wife's name.
O.K.! Send that!
So what?
I thought I put you to bed.
Miss Marsh.
It must be the sea air--it gets everybody.
Yes, a bracelet's been lost, but I'm still on my vacation.
Are you happy?
Everything O.K.?
Like it?
Yep--spending lots of time aboard--you see, Sally, I sold this Transatlantic idea to the shipping company.
No--not much--excepting-- 
Do what--
I get it--Lee Lother have a hand in that, too?
I'll never love anybody else.
I just wrote a poem about the Atlantic Ocean--
Somebody's got to do it--
Oh, you dear Atlantic Ocean--how you spread across the sea--From New York to dear old Europe--just for boats to ride on thee--
Mr. Denby--What do you think I ought to do with that part?
Mary--fall off the boat and turn to the left--
So what?
Don't blame it on the ocean!--All right, you'll get the raise!
Eh?... Oh.
The country boy's about due.
Well, I helped my hand so I'll have to see you.
Thanks to me.
A tipoff in the right quarter to take his fingerprints and--
Don't kid yourself--you know how I stand back there.
Let's see if I can bring it back to life.
Thank you.
"Smooth's" the word.
Ed Bailey, you look like you're Just ready to burst.  Well call me A fool but I guess I'll just have To call.  Cover your ears, darling.
Isn't that a daisy?
Does it hurt?  A lot?  Good.
Just this minute.  I'm Wyatt Earp, These're my brothers-
Nice voice.
Beauty, ain't he?
Where do you think?  I stole him.
And how come you call yourselves Cowboys?  Cowhands ride for the brand.
This brand.
No...
All right, lunger.  Have at it.
Here it come: one-two-
My fight's not with you, Holliday.
Enough?  Never.
What's that mean, Doc?  You know I Don't understand when you talk up High like that.  You mean you Don't want to be my lovin' man no more?
Perfect, Wyatt.  Simply perfect.
Forgive me if I don't shake hands.
You will or you won't.  Don't look To me.  I'm going to sleep.
I don't know.  It all happened so Fast.  If I'd had a chance to Think about it I guess I probably Would've been scared but... Swear To God, Doc, I just don't know.
How you feelin', Doc?
Hurts.  Hurts pretty bad.
All right, Doc...
All right.  Then what?
I see, well this happens to be a Nocturne.
Awful lot of money.
Wyatt, are you crazy?
Not so sure.  Somethin' tells me It gets harder from here in.  Should've held out for more money.
He's right, Wyatt.  Ringo could Put five into you before you Could even get one into him.
How would you know?
You mean Behan?  Then why are you with him?
Well you're different, no arguing That.  But you're a lady all right. I'll take my oath on it.
I don't know, doesn't make any Sense.  I almost can't look at You.  Like it hurts.
Wait!
Drop his horse.
But this time they'll be ready.
We'll go around that way, come up on foot.
I'm the one made a mess.  Made a Right fair mess of the whole thing.
You're on.
Listen Mister, I'm getting' tired-
Jack...
But she doted on the frowner
Just like any other hard cases. Gotta know how to handle 'em.
Better go with 'em, honey.  Here's Where I leave you.
Bring up the tracking satellite. And get 007 out of there.
Excuse me, but -  I must formally protest this meeting. Given the nature of what's occurred - and the need for secrecy - I see no reason to involve the air force, the army, or MI-6.  This is an internal affair that should be handled strictly by the officers of her Majesty's Royal Navy.
We'll see about that.
I can feel your pain.
Sightseeing.
And still not a thing to watch.
Fantastic idea Mr. Bond! Perhaps I should buy it for a book! It's totally preposterous, but -  You amuse me. ...And now perhaps I can amuse you.
Sidney, perhaps we should leave this to -
My guards are from South Africa, Mr. Bond. This is their chance to get even with the formerly 'Great' Britain.  Now both of you. Put your hands on your heads, and step forward.
I know. Pirates from Sumatra want the cargo; smugglers from Thailand and Burma want the ships.
Did you test the auto-pilots? The satellite positioning receiver?
I appreciate your time -
Moneypenny... Here I was, finally getting a feel for a new tongue -
Moneypenny! How indiscreet! Have you ever known me to kiss and tell?
No, 007. It's just that I've learned from personal experience - that when we get what we want -  Somehow the reality is never as... Satisfying as the fantasy.
I don't care who you dial, so long as it's not me. Next -
Get them out of here. If he says one word, shoot him.
I've got half the British government breathing down my neck. I don't have time for your nonsense.
No! He's crazy - he's insane. He hates everybody. He's got these plans -  You've got to help me, James. I'm sorry. I'm sorry for everything. I know I was wrong - but you've got to protect me. I know you still love -
Do you?
Shhhhh...
Leave me alone! He's going to kill me!!
Occasionally, yes.  British media mogul. Born in Hong Kong; controls newspapers, TV, radio, cable, satellites; books, magazines, movies, computer software. Theme parks.
Perhaps. But it does explain how an ex-KGB agent turned illegal-arms dealer is suddenly portrayed as a long-time friend of the people.  If you believe what you read in the papers.
I see...
Who knows? Fog, night...
Wait a minute -  I've got it. There! Off the port bow!
That's reassuring.
Jack Wade. Citibank. Commercial loan division. If you're ever lookin' for a sweet refinance on the boat -
Depends what number you write.
Happily.
I didn't think so.
Thanks.  Take care -
And exactly what business are you in, Mr. Bond?
I hope so.
Think about mom.
What?
He was my father's best friend!
...You know, that's another reason you're probably not in a successful relationship.
You insist on calling all the shots.  And by the way: I am not a helpless girl.
If not?
Next time, I do the driving.
Now.
We serve the interests of the British people, 007. No matter who we may be foolish enough to elect.
Sabotage?
Fifteen seconds. Perhaps you should consider hiring an attorney.
Send him a $10,000 campaign contribution, and explain I have no control over what my journalists write -
Approaching the first gate.
You come with me -  You stay here.
Yes. Shall we kill them?
Who is it?
I hadn't forgotten. I ordered some cloth but it didn't come in and I felt so bad if I would have come to her birthday without that, I just stayed at home.
Why are you always afraid to get somewhere?
This is what it is all about, trying to keep from being out on the street.
Maybe I can get down there next week.
I told you about calling me boy. I ain't no boy. See, you and Dad got a bad habit of calling me boy. You call me boy in front of my wife. You think I'm going to fix the roof? I hope the wind blows the whole damn thing off and it pours down rain.
You dumb ass, it's Babe Brother.
We will take her. You all stay here and watch Dad.
He is just being like all parents, concerned about the ones they love.
Why in the h...
You were in hell?
Babe Brother.
Have you lost your mind? Have you thought about your wife and child, not to mention your sick father? And I need your help to move his bed from under the leak in the ceiling.
Now how far would further out be?
Look! Don't try to get ahead by riding our backs.
You and Babe Brother are so much alike...
Hush.
Hush.
It would be nice.
You stay inside. I will see to them.
Why didn't you catch a plane?
Everything these days is made overseas.
Let me get you a cup?
Good afternoon to you.
Strange as it may seem, it might have cleared the waters. Sometimes the right action comes from the wrong reason.
Chick was outright killed by a mob. He killed a white man that owed him some money and when they caught up with him, they tied him behind a car and dragged him from out of the hills back to town.
Girl, do you still sing and dance?
Oh, I'm more modern in my ways. I don't believe in sin, though there is good and evil.  And evil is a thing you work at.
Junior's wife kept her afterbirth' in the refrigerator. That's why I do not eat over there now.
He's just raffish. Harry put him up to it. Before evening sun sets, I would have his belongings back on Route 55, that old fox.
If it was left up to me, I would poison him.
Whether the boy hears it or not, the man is still a jackass. Everyone should have some mother wit.
He is in his pigeon cage.
You know the man next door is near death.
Tolerably well. I brought you some more rabbit manure for your roses.
Now go get Molly.  Your friends are going to be here any minute.
But what if we leave them behind?
I wanted to thank you, Woody, for saving my flock.
Rocky!  The ramp!
I need to repair my turbo boosters. Do you people still use fossil fuels, or have you discovered crystalic fusion?
You can't!
Are you saying you want to lodge a complaint with Star Command? WOODY Oh okay, so you want to do it the hard way, huh?
You're mocking me, aren't you?
Where?
But we're not on my planet, are we?
Oh, yeah?  Well, if YOU hadn't shown up in your stupid little cardboard spaceship and taken away everything that was important to me --
WHAT?!!  What are you talking about?!
Go away.
Negative.  There are no restraining harnesses in the cargo area.  We'll be much safer in the cockpit.
Where is it?  I don't see the --
Alright Buzz, get ready...
One minute you're defending the whole galaxy...  ...and suddenly you find yourself suckin' down Darjeeling with Marie Antoinette and her little sisters.
Years of Academy training...wasted!!
I can't help.  I can't help anyone.
No, Woody, for the first time I am thinking clearly.  You were right all along.  I'm not a Space Ranger.  I'm just a toy.  A stupid little insignificant toy.
Come on, Sheriff.  There's a kid over in that house who needs us. Now let's get you out of this thing.
We've got to get out of here...NOW.
Hold still, Buzz!
Pardon me.  I hate to break up the staff meeting, but THEY'RE HERE! Birthday guests at three o'clock!
What's with him?
I got dibs on his hat!
She's sick!
I'll have to perform one of my...operations!
Outta my way!  Here I come, here I come --
And I'm from Mattel.  Well, I'm not actually  from Mattel, I'm actually from a smaller company that was purchased in a leveraged buy-out. Well, I don't really understand the financials, but...
Will you quit moving around?!
I can't tell.  Hey, where's Lenny?
Wait!  Wait!  I got a better idea! How about we DON'T?!
I was close to being scared that time.
But what if Andy gets another dinosaur?  A mean one?  I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection.
Hey look!  It's Buzz!
Yes SIR!
This is it!  This is it!  Quiet, quiet, quiet!
So did I tell ya?  Huh?  Nothing to worry about.
Sh-h-h-h-h!!
We're gonna get outta here, Buzz -- Buzz?
Speed up!
Do you know you've lovely hair, even if you torment it in those braids.
Home is where the heart is.
You're not so old yourself!
Almighty Jove in the shape of a swan.
H'm?
All the time.
So did I.
Sixteen. Well, nearly sixteen.
Of course he is.  I've known him for twenty years and he doesn't jaywalk...
I know I made things worse.  I know that and I'm sorry, but Arnie I need something from you.  Something only you can help me with.
What are you thinking, calling me at home with a message like that?  You've compromised me and our relationship --
I just didn't want to take a chance. I didn't want to risk it.  It could have been frozen along with everything else.
Carl, that's insane.
Carl --
Drugs begin pouring out of America into every other country in the world. Canada is completely overwhelmed.
The first thing we have to do is present a unified front.
Look, I'm as worried as you are --
You can't make me.
Yes.
Yeah.
Just watch.
Then here's a little bump.
I think so.  If she didn't she should have.  I've only got maybe an hour.  Then volleyball practice is over and I have to be home.
We got you on tape making the deal. We got you bragging about the quality. We got you bragging about your business.  We got you.
She ain't in on it.
I love my job.  I love it.  The next time I'm having a bad day you gotta remind me of right now and I'll get over it.
I don't know.
Depends on the state.
Medicinal marijuana initiative.  Or am I being cynical?
We're playing!
You're kidding.  Can't you shoot him or something?
I am a legitimate business.  Fishing boats.  Tuna.  Check it out.  Tax records, everything --
You can't visit me here.  I want my lawyer.
When the DEA gets into the narcotics business, then we'll stay at the Four Seasons.
That thought makes me feel awful.
You're breaking my heart.
So go shower already.
That is not true, Mrs. Ayala.  Your route is compromised.  Perhaps it is time for me to deal with other distributors in California.
You don't?  Listen to this woman in a man's world, a very violent world.
You want to smuggle narcotics in Mr. Espastico Jacobo.  That's nothing new.
That's crazy.  My husband is on trial for smuggling.
Your new friends.
Not this time.
We thought maybe you'd have that kind of information for us.
Javier Rodriguez.
An informant.
It was an anonymous tip.
Any way we can do it better?
I have money --
I'll pay you a thousand dollars.  I have it in my wallet.
We sometimes went downtown to score.
Yes, I am confident that Juan Obregon will be taken into custody before the end of the year.  But, you must understand that it is very difficult because of corruption in the police force.  We get a tip that he is one place, then we get there and he is already gone, having been warned by someone on our side.
Like you protected Landry?
Agents who died in the field.
Right.  Now it's used by somebody from the Juarez Cartel, one of his lieutenants...  Who knows?  Every damn day there's birthday party. At first I thought they must have three hundred children, then I realized they're taunting us.  Three miles away and we can't touch them. Ha, ha, ha.
What do you mean?
What kind of research?
Because I fucking told you to do that, you doss cunt.
But it's not worth more than fifteen.
Sorry, mate, I'll get you another.
Too right it is. Now look, have you got anything to eat, 'cos I'm fucking Lee Marvin, by the way.
Let's face it, it could have been wonderful.
Diane.
What?
Too young for what?
Unless you get caught.
What do you think -- I should be carrying a torch for you?
He forgot. Useless motherfucker.
What was it, pneumonia or cancer?
Exactly. I'm not wanting a cat, she says. Get to fuck, right. So there's Tommy stuck with this kitten. You can imagine what happened. The thing was neglected, pissing and shitting all over the place. Tommy was lying around fucked out of his eyeballs on smack or downers. He didn't know you could get toxoplasmosis from cat shit.
Exactly. Those very words have been my guiding light in what is, after all, a dark and often hostile world.
Sorry about last night -
It's no problem.
No.
No, I'm clean.
My problem is that I tend to clam up. I go dumb and I can't answer any questions at all. Nerves on the big occasion, like a footballer.
Another dab?
Goldfinger's better than Dr. No. Both of them are a lot better than Diamonds are Forever a judgement reflected in its relative poor showing at the box office, in which field, of course, Thunderball was a notable success.
Eh - Ian Fleming?
What do you mean?
It wasn't that bad.
What?
You're all hear.
I got a good price for it. Rents, I need the money.
Yeah, well, it surely worked for him.
Your usual table, sir?
As you wish.
Yeah.
Such as?
Are you serious?
It's a nightmare. She told me she didn't want our relationship to start on a physical basis as that is how it would be principally defined from then on in.
She read it in Cosmopolitan.
I've got balls like watermelons, I'm telling you.
But where?
I don't know, Tommy. I don't know if it's... normal.
No, not homeless people. Beggars, Francis Begbie -- one of my mates. I wouldn't say my best mate, I mean, sometimes the boy goes over the score, like one time when we -- me and him -- were having a laugh and all of a sudden he's fucking gubbed me in the face, right --
It is I.  The journey you undertook to reach me could not have been an easy one.
He doubts me.
Bring it closer so that I might join with it. Do it, or watch these puny things die horribly.
Rescued at last.
Is there a problem, gentlemen?
Sulu! Look! The sun's come out! It's a miracle!
And we can't see a thing. Request you direct us to the coordinates.
Plotting our new course.
But, Captain, we're firing directly on your position.
I don't have a clue.
Your threats amuse me, Captain Chekov. What consequences did you have in mind?
I apologize for canceling shore leave, but look, we have a dangerous situation out on Nimbus III.
I think you gave me too much time, Captain.
I'm flattered. Twelve hundred points of interest in Yosemite and you pick me.
Are we leaving, Captain?
Yes, Spock?
I cannot be certain.
He reminds me of someone I knew in my youth.
Who is it he reminds you of?
Yes, Captain?
If I had pulled the trigger, Sybok would be dead.
The only problem is, it's up there. We're down here.
Hmmm?
If I activate them now, Captain, we will be propelled upward at an unbelievable rate.
The emergency channel, open.
Welcome aboard, Captain.
I was thinking of Sybok. I've lost a brother.
"Let's see what she's got," said the Captain. And then we found out, didn't we?
Starfleet, are you aware of our currant status?
Of course. Of course. Then I'll take the ship without your help.
I cannot go with you.
This is my doing. This is my arrogance... my vanity...
No. You must save yourselves. Forgive me, brother. Forgive me.
Yeah. Tryin' to find the file and erase it. Once that's gone, ain't nothin' can stop him. Just Eddie and his Master Control Program, runnin' things from on high..
Hi, Flynn.
Frustrating. I had Tron almost ready to run, and Dillinger cut everybody with Group 7 access out of the system.
Hello, Alan.
No, nyet, negatory, not on your tintype, no way.
For sure...
No...
There's a 68.71 percent chance you're right.
What do you want with the Pentagon?
Walter, I sympathize, but I have data coming out of the Master Control Program saying there is something screwy --
It can be arranged...
I'm sorry, Walt. So much pressure lately... you feel like going for a drink?
Oh, you want to -- hah. I could get myself de-rezzed just-for letting you in here. They hate this tower. They'd close it down if they dared to but they keep me around, in case one of them wants to deal with the other world once in a while. And you should hear the way they commune! Sounds like they were routing a payroll, for all the heart they put in it. No, I don't think you
Alan-One. He calls me... may I pass?
No... Tron ... must... destroy MCP... first...
No good...they might block off the old chip.  This way.
Greetings, program...
Wrote the...?
Look, you guys know how it is. You just keep doin' what it looks like you're supposed to, even if it seems crazy, and you hope to hell your User knows what's goin' on.
How about you?
Let's get some power here.
Oh, I was an actuarial program... worked at a big insurance company. It really gives you a great feeling, helping folks plan for their future needs -- and of course, if you look at the payments as an annuity, over the years, the cost is really
How 'bout yourself?
Tron...?
Not much chance of that now. The MCP can just slip it into another system as soon as it locates it...
You're getting out of the business?
We might be capturing some military programs soon... that interest you?
He's not any kind of program, Sark. He's a User.
Now get this straight, pal -- no one User wrote me. I'm worth a couple million of their man-years! I'm bigger than all those little wimps put together!  Humans they can't even keen their social order in one piece
You rather take your chances with me? Want me to slow down your power cycles for you?
We have to.
That's all going to change, Yori...
Don't know yet... I have to get in touch with Alan. He was going to tell me how to
As long as it gets us out of here
I can't. There's no junction due for at least 7 or 8 nanoseconds!
I'm shocked.
Mom, wake up!  Dad barely knows we exist.
Where are you going?
Great!  You're going to believe that fat dweeb Mr. Hardy over your own daughter.
I'm not a pumpkin!  Okay?!!  Do I look even remotely like a pumpkin?! I'm not a muffin, or a cupcake or a honeybear either! And you don't understand anything Dad...
Dad.  You just think you know everything, don't you?
Roger, One.  Rolling.
Why?
What?
In her dreams.
Nope.  The art buys are in a separate ledger.
She could be moving money, guns. Anything.
That's it.  Get 'im Harry  We'll teach that little puke not to signal.
Son of a bitch!
It can't be.
Helen's phone.  Her office line and the line at my house.
What are you talking about?
You tell on me, I tell on you.
Get 'em.  I'll brief them on the way in.
It's show time.  Don't look at					* the flash.  Do not look at the flash.
Sorry.
No!  Never!
Very good.  It's sixth century B.C.  Do you like the period?
Is that why you got into this business?
You're damaged goods, lady.
Fine, honey.  Stay asleep.
Yeah.  It was great.
I'll just be a second.  So what happened tonight at the office?
Yeah.  It was a rush thing.  They needed some documents down at the court house.  I barely made it.
I don't know anything about a faction.  I just met Simon...  or whatever his name is...  a couple of weeks ago.  I barely know him.
Well, maybe a little.
Harry?  What can I say about Harry?  He's a sales rep for a computer company.
Yeah.  I suppose he is.
You're in a lot of trouble, Mrs. Tasker, so I suggest you cooperate.  If we want to know the most intimate details of your life, you'd better tell us.
You will be contacted with the assignment.
No.  Doris.
Sure, hon.
I'm not wearing any.
Sodium amytal, maybe some other truth agent.
Ask me a question I would normally lie to.
I told the guy---  I told the guy, this isn't even my order.
So what's your angle?
Some kinda legal secretary of something.  Married to some boring jerk.
What is it you need me to do?
I don't know.  I have to think...
He wants to speak with you.
Yeah. I got elbowed right in the eye. And if that wasn't enough, I got hurled the ball when I'm not looking. Wam! Right in my face.
Ya looked through it?
I thought Sonny was the good guy.
What time is it?
Would you like to get some pie?
I'm sure there must be something, but I don't really remember. The only thing that comes to mind are Persians.
And in a theater full of empty seats, why did you sit by me?
That's a "Rookies" doll. George Sanford Brown. We gotta lotta dolls. They're real cool. Did you know they came out with dolls for all the actors in "The Black Hole"? I always found it funny somewhere there's a kid playin' with a little figure of Earnest Borgnine.
That's what happened. In fact, when she died, it was considered to be the happiest time of her life. She'd been fucked over so much by men she didn't trust them. She was havin' this relationship with this guy and he asked her to marry him. Now, other people had asked to marry her before, but she couldn't be sure whether they really loved her or were just after her money. So, she said no. And the guy says, "Look, I really love you, and I wanna prove it. So have your lawyers draw up a paper that says no matter what happens, I can never get any of your money, and I'll sign it." So she did, and he asked her, and she said yes. And once they were engaged he told her a secret about himself that she never knew: he was a millionaire.
I'm a call girl. There's a difference, ya know.  I don't know. Maybe there's not. That place you took me to last night, that comic book place.
Uh-huh.
He thinks he is. He says his mother was Apache, but I suspect he's lying.
Well, I wouldn't go so far as to call him nice, but he's treated me pretty decent. But I've only been there about four days. He got a little rough with Arlene the other day.
Slapped her around a little. Punched her in the stomch. It was pretty scary.
You will?
Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes...
No, Clarence. Just forget it, babe. I just wanna disappear from there.
What?
That rhymes.
Nigger, back off, you ain't beatin' shit. Now what would you do.
Take that shit somewhere else.
Can you live with it?
I don't blame you.
Can you develop an ulcer in two minutes? Being cool is hard on your body.
Are you kiddin'? He loves you.
That's why it doesn't come across as ass-kissin', because it's genuine, and he can see that.
Get the fuck outta here!
Ask him if he got the letter.
Did you meet Captain Kirk?
Drexl's dead. This is Clarence's coke and Clarence can do whatever he wants with it. And what Clarence wants to do is sell it. Then me and Bama are gonna leave on a jet plane and spend the rest of our lives spendin'. So, you got my letter, have you lined up any buyers?
Yeah, they do. And maybe when I start being a successful actor I'll know those guys. But most of the people I know are like me. They ain't got a pot to piss in or a window to throw it out of. Now, if you want to sell a little bit at a time -
Two guys.
No shit? Dick, that's great!
No, I don't really mean it. Well, I mean, this is our last chance to think about it. How 'bout you, Bama?
No thanks, my stomach's a little upset. I ate somethin' at a restaurant that made me a little sick.
Ha ha ha. No really, where does it come from?
Mr. Donowitz?  I told you, through Dick.  He's in my acting class.  About a year.  Yeah, he's good.  They grew up together.  Sure thing.
No. No you're not.
I can see what you mean.
The biggest. The biggest movie you've ever dealt with, Lee. We're talkin' a lot of film. A man'd have ta be an idiot not to be a little cautious about a movie like that. And Lee, you're no idiot.
I don't think that'll be necessary. Let's all have a seat. Boris, why don't you be nice and get coffee for everybody.
Don't worry, I'll desire. Boris, could I have some more coffee.
We grew up together.
Actually, they can count it. I'd like to use the little boy's room.
That's about all I ever eat.
You know what would taste good? Chicken. I haven't had chicken in a while. Chicken would really hit the spot about now. Chicken and beer, definitly, absolutely, without a doubt.  Where's a good chicken place around here?
She seems very nice.
Clarence, just shut up, you're giving me a headache! I can't believe how much like your mother you are. You're your fuckin' mother through and through. I haven't heard from ya in three years. Then ya show up all of a sudden at eight o'clock in the morning. You walk in like a goddamn bulldozer... don't get me wrong, I'm happy to see you... just slow it down. Now, when did you get married?
Do you still have friends on the force?
Could you find out if they know anythin'? I don't know they know shit about us. But I don't wanna think, I wanna know. You could find out for sure what's goin' on.  Daddy?
Who is he?
Now I can't be sure of how much of what he told you. So in the chance you're in the dark about some of this, let me shed some light. That whore your boy hangs around with, her pimp is an associate of mine, and I don't just mean pimpin', in other affairs he works for me in a courier capacity. Well, apparently, that dirty little whore found out when we're gonna do some business, 'cause your son, the cowboy and his flame, came in the room blastin' and didn't stop till they were pretty sure everybody was dead.
That's of minor importance. But what's of major fuckin' importance is that I believe you. Where did they go?
Shit, are you behind. Me and Robin got a divorce six months ago. Got myself a new place - mirrors all over the bedroom, ceiling fans above the bed. Guy'd have to look as ugly as King Kong not to get laid in this place. I'm serious, a guy'd have to look like a gorilla.
Step inside.
Where'd you come from?
You're no longer an extra -
But there is a bright side though. If you ever have to play a part of a guy who gets fucked in the ass on a daily basis by throat-slitting niggers, you'll have so much experience to draw on -
Naw man, I don't be eatin' that shit.
What can I do?
I'm not gonna put that shit in my purse.
I'm not wearing a bra.
Do you know where we can find him?
I went to the surface and I collected specimens like I was told.
Uh, what?
Uh, I think so.  In the mental hospital.
You don't want to jeopardize that reduction, do you, Cole?  Have it taken away?
Forced you!  Why would someone force you to take drugs?
It was released in Philadelphia, probably on June 14, 1995.
Meaning...???
I need to go now.
It won't help you.  You can't do anything about it.  You can't change anything.
Because I'm a good observer.  Because I have a tough mind.
You wouldn't understand.
Underground.
I love this air.  This is wonderful air.
1995?
No, 1995 is the past.
1989.  Six years for you.  There's the sign!  Right here!
You told me you'd help me.  I know this isn't what you meant, but...I was desperate... no money...bum leg... sleeping on the streets. I probably smell bad.  Sorry about that. But then I saw your book in a store window with a notice about your lecture.  I can read, remember?
What?
It wasn't me before, James.  It's become me now because of...what's happening.  Please untie me.
I'm not going to "do" anything, I promise.  But you need help, James. None of this is what you think it is.
Yeah, sort of, I guess.  I...I'm sorry I locked you up.  I thought...I thought... I think maybe I am crazy!
Jeffrey Mason said it was my idea about the virus.  And suddenly, I wasn't sure.  We talked when I was in the institution, and it was all...fuzzy. The drugs and stuff.  You think maybe I'm the one who wiped out the human race?  It was my idea?
Give me the gun.
Well, you look pretty different, too.
I was here...as a kid.  I think you were here, too.  But you...looked just like you look now.
Scientists.  I'm supposed to report in to them.  They'll want to know they sent me to the wrong time.
In the 18th century there was no such thing!  Nobody'd ever imagined such a thing -- no sane person anyway.  Along comes this doctor...Semmelweiss, I think.  He tries to convince people... other doctors mostly...that there are these teeny tiny invisible "bad things" called germs that get into your body and make you...sick!  He's trying to get doctors to wash their hands.  What is this guy...crazy?  Teeny tiny invisible whaddayou call 'em?..."germs"!
If you know how to escape, why don't you...?
Not as bad as what they're doing to kitty.
Pulling out the tooth, man, that was nuts!  Here, take this.
It's a digital reconstruction of a message, Cole, from a weak signal on our contact number.  Did you make that call?
Please tell me, Jeffrey, what exactly are you going to do?  I don't have to tell you I'm afraid.
Then how come she knows what's going on?
Were you listening?  We got two officers in the hospital.  Yeah, he's in restraints, plus the medic gave him enough stellazine to kill a horse.  Look at him!  Still on his feet.
Twelve Monkeys, honey.  Guess you folks didn't turn on your radio this morning.
I can see just fine.  For example: You're a young man who thinks he's got someplace to be.
Think you'll live that long?
We all got plans.  I planned on seeing all my life.  I know you didn't plan on straying into town.
Well, a man with some gumption.  How much money you got?
You want to make a kiddies bet?
I got more brains than you've got teeth.
How much.
The ticket is thirty dollars.
'Cause Harlin used to own it.
If I could do you think I'd be standing here wasting my time.  Can you fix it, or do I have to go somewhere else?
Okay, I'm stuck.  You happy?  Now can you fix it, or not?
Don't look like nothing.
A God damn radiator hose in a sixty- four-and-a-half Mustang.  You know how long it took me to find that hose?
I don't know, but it's the reason I'm living here and you're just passing through.  Now you owe me a hundred-fifty dollars.
Listen, Darrell, about that hundred- fifty bucks for the car, as soon as I get where I'm going I swear I'll--
I didn't tell you to do it!  You can't just do unauthorized work.
What reputation?  You're nothing but an ignorant, inbred, tumble weed hick.
What's the matter?  The fight gone out of you?  I'm just gonna smash a headlight.  Maybe two.
Honest like Al Capone on tax day. Where are my keys?
Yes.  Yes it is.
I know.  I was here when your apprentice was helping you. Remember?
They look nice.
I picked them out for you, Jake.  I thought you would like the colors.
You didn't hear something?
The wind isn't blowing.
What are you afraid of?  I'm the one's got the gun.  Stay here.
Maybe, but if you didn't I think you would have kept on walking.
What happened to your hand?
You should be more careful.
If you're going to gamble, might as well play for high stakes.
I pack up and go somewhere else.
Thank you.
Like you.
Nothing like a little liveliness.
Really?  And what game did you want to play?  You carry my box for me, and I fall into bed with you?
You just walk away.
You need a meal ticket is what you mean.  Some guy you can latch onto just long enough for him to get you out of here.
Beautiful.  Beautiful beaches.  Blue water and clear skies as far as you can see.
From?
Kill someone.  I can't do it.
Is that what changed your mind?  The money?
You're calling Jake stupid?  You!?
We're going all the way.  Together.
Never needed one.  I've never been anywhere.  I've got a backpack.
Wait.  What about . . . him?
Give him the money.
And you're not one to lie, are you?
Yeah, they'll find you.  Dried up and twice dead.
Didn't much look like you were hanging drapes.
Yeah, I know.  More careful.
Jake McKenna.  That's a solid name.
My car overheated.  I pulled in to have it fixed.
Got work.  I know a man who's got a boat.  Wants me to sail it for him.
That's the sweat of a man who hasn't an honest bone in his body.  Don't be offended, lad.  A man who's got no ethics is a free man.  I envy you that.  Beside, I can hardly blame you.  That Grace has a mind of her own, and a body to match, don't she? Eh?
Like you don't know.
How do you know if you've never tried?
I had a problem getting my car back.
I do all right.  Real estate isn't a bad game such as it is around here. The trick is to underestimate the price when you buy it, and overvalue when you sell.  You can turn a few dollars that way.
I do.
Make it twenty.
How much could you get?
Do we shake hands?
And tell her what?
Is the job done?
I know all right.  I know you're just enough of a shit to have a go at bedding a man's wife.  You've probably bagged a few at that. You'd probably lie, cheat and steal without thinking twice.  From that you'd just turn and walk away.  But to kill; to get that blood on your hands.  You can't wash that off. You'd be a marked man for life. Just like Cain.  And you're a sinner who wants to walk with the saints. Ain't that right, boy?
I hate loving her.  I hate the kind of her person she is.  I hate having to tolerate the little games she plays.  I hate letting her use me. But I love her too much to do otherwise.  And I certainly love her too much to kill her.  I couldn't stand to watch her eyes roll back in her head as she sucks her last breath, or to see her pretty pink brains spill from her skull.  But you?  You got the killing in you, boy.
Came close this time and it scares you.
No.
Maybe you heard old Jake's got some money stashed away and you thought you'd help yourself to a little.
And then with Jake out of the way you could borrow two-hundred dollars.  Or maybe two-thousand.  Or twenty-thousand.  Who's to stop you? Not Jake McKenna, 'cause old Jake would be dead.
There's another reason?  It better be good.
Wh . . . what are you talking about?
You're not talking sense.
Think about it.  How do you think I got in here?  Did you hear any glass break?  Did you hear a door splinter?  How did the evening end? After you went to bed did she linger a bit?  Maybe just long enough to leave the back door unlocked?  Is that what happened?
You know what kind of woman Grace is.  You know how badly she wants to get the fuck out of Sierra.  What makes you think when you were planning on killing her she wasn't doing the same for you?  What's she to you, Jake; a woman who would have you dead?  Let me kill her.  All I want is two-hundred dollars to get out of here with.
I said come on!
What?
That country shit all sounds the same to me.
She's dead.
I've had time to get over it.
How old are you?
Will you shut up!
Mister, I'm calling you out.
You know who I am?  Toby N. Tyler. My friends call me TNT. You know why?
Give it to me!
No.  He gets shot by the old lady.
Hello?  Hello!?  Operator, I got disconnected.  Hello . . .
Yeah.  What are you going to do? That Toby's a hot head.
No, sir.  And I'm not going to be around long if that's what you're worried about.
Not as bad as it looks.
Shut up!  The both of you.  Ain't neither one of you too smart. Especially you, boy.  Don't you think I had my eye on you since first you rolled into town?  You smell like trouble.  Stink of it like a ripe cesspool.
Eh?
You want something?
I'm sorry, I didn't--
I don't know.  I thought you were keeping the sun out of your eyes.
That's 'cause he's dead.
He's only just dead.  What was I supposed to do with him?  I can't take him away anywhere.  And nobody wants to take him for me.  Do you?
What do you want for free?
So now you're going to tell me where I lost my eyes. You don't think I know where I lost my eyes? I was there when I lost them. I lost them in the war. The war in the joint. There's always wars in the joint. Cause I was a code talker in the joint and in the war too. Mmmm, nothing like the smell of a naked lady. Be careful, boy.
Well, people gotta get by somehow. That's the curse. The mines done it. All that uranium, plutonium, fuffonium, fuckononium, assononium, all that "om"! Everybody's got a mother. You don't rip up your mother. You don't rip up the Earth and take everything out. It's like the Cracker Jack box says, "the more you eat, the more you want...."...
I'm a little short Pops. I'll catch you next time.
No and I don't plan on sticking around either.
Mister, I'm calling you out.
Not before I settle with you, chickenshit!
Easy, chief. I... I was helping your wife. I met her in town.  She needed a hand with her drapes.  That's all.
Grace, tell him.
Yeah...
Accident.
That's a solid name.
Bobby Cooper.
It wouldn't have made a difference to you, now would it?  Not a wit.  Do you know why? Because you're a man without scruples.
Ah, I can smell it on you.
Can't live with them, and you can't shoot 'em.
About what you said this morning.
Boy I think this heat's getting to you the way you're rambling on.
Oh, that was just loose talk. Husband gettin' pissed off.  I don't want anybody dead.
A man doesn't always mean the things he says.
Maybe ... ten-thousand.  And that's a maybe.
I like Darrell.  He may be an idiot, but he's my half brother. We own Harlin's together, yeah, that little redneck manages to get paid no matter how things work out.
It's not what you think, Jake.
You know what kind of woman Grace is, Jake. You know how badly she wants to get the fuck out of Superior.  What's she to you, Jake; a woman who wants you dead?  Let me kill her.  All I want is two-hundred dollars to get out of here with.
For what?
Doubt it.  He's dead.  The Look Out's a cemetery.
Yep.
Time.
Jesus.  Twenty-after-ten and it must be ninety already.
You got to be more careful. Hands is important.  Let me show you something. When I was a kid, now I don't know if you can still see it, but I gashed my fingers in a lawnmower.
Don't look like nothing.
About an hour and a half, because that's all the longer I've been gone.
You said this morning the hose was going to run me one-fifty.
What reputation?  You're nothing but an ignorant, inbred, tumbleweed hick.
What's the matter?  The fight gone out of you?  I'm just gonna smash a headlight. Maybe two.
Darrell.
Open up!
I want my car.
No! No police.
I'm just going to my car?
My mother told me never to accept offers from strangers.
I just drove in this morning.
I guess I've got wander in my blood.
Thank you.
It tells me what every face tells me. Everybody has a past, they have a pain, and they have something they want.  What is it you want?
What?
You know what I want.
They hear you comin'.  They won't bother you. Just don't sneak up on 'em.
Depends on what you call love. I grew up on a reservation. A patch of desert in the middle of nowhere. That's where they stick Indians, Bobby. That's where they leave us to die. My brother killed himself when he was 19 cause he couldn't take it anymore. There's no hope there... Jake was my ticket out. Mom and me.
Nothing.
He <u>was</u> a Shaman...in the mine. We had nothin' after he died. Jake took us in, gave us a little money. He used to call me his "little halfbreed"... He kept Mom on the side y'know, cause he was married someplace else. He had kids in Phoenix I think, no one knew him around here...but the thing was...you see...  ...he was raping me the whole time...for years. He loved to do things to me. Believe it or not, he used to say he was in love with my ass. Y'ever been in love with a woman's ass?
Oh yeah. There's nothing else with Jake. He don't trust banks. He keeps the money in the floor right under the bed. He loves it so much, he wouldn't think of spending any of it on me. I never seen it but I know he's got more than a hunnert thousand at least...
I don't think we have anything to talk about.
Stop it.
Because I know you're full of shit.
What are you talking about?
Ask you what? You mean what kind of horrifying sick shit is coming next?
Can you make it back up?
Son.  Little excitement out at the reservation this morning. Wayne and Dale Elkhart were up drinking all night and then Wayne starts chasing Dale around the desert with his shotgun. BIA handled it. I went by for backup.
With a <u>shotgun</u>!  She kills <u>both</u> of 'em, and... and the money in my bag gets all shredded to bloody pieces. Not one bill is left alive.  I mean, what are the odds?
But, in particular?
No, we ain't got no Heineken.  We got Miller.
More like Jenny is after every man she sees.
Virgil!  Now look at what you done!  Are you all right?
No baby, you got it wrong.
I know.  I was here when your apprentice was helping you.  Remember?
They look nice.
Yes, yes, hit me...beat me, please.
Oh no! Oh please forgive me, Papa!
I want my lawyer!
I haven't been sick this year. I know that.
Do you remember me getting sick?
That's strange isn't it? Not remembering one fever... Or a cold... Or a sore throat. What do you think that means?
Yes.
Think carefully?
In college. A car accident.
The life of an idea that has lived too long in my head.
You're skill.
It's an exaggeration of the truth. Maybe it's based on something as simple as instinct. Like being able to touch someone and tell whether they've done something wrong... Or the level of what they've done wrong.
Or he might have been carrying a silver handled gun tucked in his pants.
I never said you couldn't be killed. I never said that.
There's a message for you at the office. Your kid was hurt.
Just play one set of downs. I told them you were great.
I'll help you.
No.
All of it.
That's great.
Jeremy listen to what--
That's what I said to my son. He said, there's always two kinds. The soldier villain who fights the hero with his hands, and then there's the real threat. The brilliant and evil arch enemy who fights the hero with his mind.
No.
How long have you been married?
And what was that explanation?
Asked what they looked like, that's all. Christ, maybe he's tough but he sure ain't no carpenter.
Alice an' Silky gave them... free ones.
Your wife?
Be careful with those, sonny.
Enemies, Bob? You been talking about the Queen again? On Independence Day?
You figure nobody'll want to fuck her.
Huh? Hullo, Skinny. Snuck up on me.  How do you like her?
N-no. I wr-wr-wr-write... I wr- wrwrite...
Meaning the duck himself, I guess.
Duck, I says.  "You have insulted the honor of this beautiful woman, Corcoran," said the duck. "You must apologize." But Two Gun Corcoran would have none of it and, cursing, he reached for his pistols and would have killed them but The Duck was faster and hot lead blazed from his smoking sixguns." 
Is... is it... loaded?
Uh... Sheriff... Uh...
Uh... hang the... uh... carpenter. I...
Nobody didn't kill Ned, he went South yesterday. He didn't even kill nobody. Why would anybody kill Ned?
I could of... easy.
Well, Uncle Pete said you was the goddamndest meanest sonofabitch ever lived an' if I ever wanted a partner for a killin', you was the worst one. Meanin' the best. On account of you're cold as snow an' don't have no weak nerve nor fear.
Huh?
I don't never see nobody anyhow.
I was gonna kill them two by myself. It don't take three.
Well... I don't recollect.
Maybe, maybe not. Got him in the gut, I think.
After a ways.
Yeah.
Shit... I thought they was gonna get us. I was even... scared a little... just for a minute.  Was you ever scared in them days?
Yeah.
Well, you don't wanna trust me too much. We'll take Ned his share together so you don't figure I run off with it.
Huh?
I didn't see nothin' planted.
Why would the Kid shoot at us?
How far kin you see?
I know it's rainin',  Give the Kid a drink, why dontcha?
What he was talkin' about... how them deputies had the drop on you an' Pete...
He's dead, Bill.
The angel... the angel of death. I'm scared, Ned. Ned, I'm gonna die.
We got to kill this other one first.  Shit, Ned, if we're lucky, we could kill him by nightfall... or maybe tomorrow morning. Then we could head back, all three of us, with the money.
I ain't waitin', Bill.  I'll look in on your youngsters when I get back.
Best we move that pig.
Did I what?
Nothin's bent.
He's blind, for Chri...
Yeah.
Three days? We could kill 'em tomorrow.
All of it. About him, an' you an' Uncle Pete... about robbin' the Rock Island Pacific... an' about them Missouri Banks.
There's more.
Do your friend a favor, Fenster, keep him quiet .
This whole thing was a shakedown.
What do you care what he says?
Can we stealth these guys?
Hockney was just a bad bastard. Good with explosives. Mean as a snake when it mattered .
I can run. I got no problem with that.
Did you hear what he just said?
Hurt you, you sonofabitch? I could kill you.
Don't do this. Send her a card - something.
I want you to find Edie. Both of you find some place safe. Tell her what happened - Everything. She knows people. She'll know what to do. If we can't get Kobayashi my way, she'll get him her way.
What time is it?
This I had to see myself.
Mr. Redfoot knew nothing. Mr. Soze rarely                 t works with the same people for very long, and they never know who they're working for. One cannot be betrayed if one has no people.
A strange threat. I can only assume you're here to kill me anyway. Pity about Mr. Redfoot.
We'll see.
I've got a ton of work and no good people.
Two hours, tops.
Which is shit.
Waste of time.
What?
I know he was good.
Keaton was a piece of shit.
I just want to hear your story.
He loved her.
I don't think you do. But you say you saw Keaton die. I think you're covering his ass and he's still out there somewhere. I think he was behind that whole circus in the harbor. My bet is he's using you because you're stupid and you think he's your friend. You tell me he's dead, so be it. I want to make sure he's dead before I go back to New York.
The D.A. gave me immunity.
And this is why you never told the D.A.
Edie.
It was all Keaton. We followed him from the beginning.
Maybe so, but I'm no rat, Agent Kujan. You tricked me, that's all. I won't keep my mouth shut 'cause I'm scared. I'11 keep it shut 'cause I let Keaton down by getting caught - Edie Finneran too. And if they kill me, it's
Then prosecute. I will be very impressed to see if the District Attorney manages to bring in twenty-seven simultaneous counts of murder against one man with cerebral palsy. I would think a man with your job would agree with these alleged &quot;faceless people in City Hall&quot; you mention.
Mr. Kint will plead guilty to weapons possession.
Weapons. Misdemeanor one.
Abrams...
Yes.
She's the only nurse who isn't testifying for the Doctors.
Accused.  Not indicted.  He resigned the firm.  Divorced nineteen seventy.  Galvin worked with Michael Morrissey until Morrissey retired in 'seventy-eight.  Since then he's been on his own.  Four cases before the Circuit Court.  He lost them all.  He drinks.
All right.  But let's keep the price down.  I've called Ed Concannon.  He recommends that we continue to respond as if we're going to trial.
And no one will know the truth.
It looks that way.
... a Mrs. Doneghy called ... I told you that.
Does that mean I'm back for awhile?
Don't equivocate.  Be positive. Just tell the truth.
...I was one of a group of...
Yes.
When she...
`Code Blue,' what does that mean...?
Tell me one?
Well, we...
Yes.
I doubt we'll have to go to trial ...
You ruined my life, Mister...Me and my wife...and I am going to ruin yours...  You don't have to go out there to see that girl.  We been going four years.    Four years...my wife's been crying herself to sleep what they, what, what they did to her sister.
What you thought!?  What you thought...I'm a workingman, I'm trying to get my wife out of town, we hired you, we're paying you, I got to find out from the other side they offered two hundred...
What qualifies you as an expert in anesthetics?
That's what I'd planned to...
Negligent.  Yes...it would have been criminal.  But that was not the case.
Right.  Who called?
You're going to settle out of court?
Why?
And ask me what?
Who says that I'm protecting anyone?
...things change.
That happens.
Thank you, your Honor, I'll continue.  Dr. Thompson.  Did you examine Deborah Ann Kaye last night at The Northern Chronic Care Facility?
Overruled...
...Would you, would you call him up.  I'll give you my number, and ask him...
I understand.  Thank you, my name is Galvin.  I'll be at the following number in a half an hour.  It's urgent.
Let me talk to Mickey.
If you're selling something, I'm late for work...
My subscription lapsed three years ago...
Still looking.
The TV didn't work.
Yes.  It was, actually.
And is that what you're going to do?    Is that what you're going to do...?
You're talking like a drunk.
I have to talk to you.
He's...you can't reach him, Sir. He's in the, on some island in the Caribbean, they don't have a phone.   He'll be back in a week...  If you'd like Dr. Halpern's number...
I'm going to help her.
They killed her.  And they're trying to buy it...
I know what I said but not now. You won it.  Franky.  You won it. When they give you the money, that means that you won.  We don't want to go to court -- is this getting to you...?  You know who the attorney is for the Archdiocese, Eddie Concannon.
You got the admittance form says patient ate nine hours prior to admittance.
Yeah?  And what are you going to do tonight?
So what do you want me to do? Concannon's going to try the case his way, I'm going to try it mine. You want me to go wee wee wee all the time because he's got some flack, got stories in the newspaper. I'm going to win this case.
I'm swell.
You use their witness.
I think we tried that.  The case is over.
Yeah.  I'm awake.
All right.  Who wasn't in the O.R.?
What did she do?
The 'History'...?
Come on, we'll get a cup of coffee...
But what can we do?  She don't know who's visiting her ...
... But Dick, he's looking for two years in Tucson ... and they called him  up and said to come out. He's a good man.  He's only trying to do what's right.
... and I have inquiries out to doctors, experts in the field ... there is, of course, a problem getting a doctor to testify that another doctor's negligent ...
I'm going to see you get that chance.
She did?
Mrs...
Yes.
She said she had a full meal one hour before coming to the hospital.
That's for sure, Frank.
We'd gone to 'Code Blue,' we were administering electro...
How'm I doing so far?
The Big Boy did...?
I married into it.
Almost a year.
San Francisco's changed. The things a that spell San Francisco to me are disappearing fast.
I'd like to have lived here then. The color and excitement... the power...  the freedom.
No... no, thanks. A bit early in the day for spirits.  Well, I guess that about covers everything, doesn't it? I never married; I don't see much of the "old college gang"; I'm a retired detective -- and you're in the shipbuilding business.  What's on your mind, Gavin?
From whom?
No.
It's not my line.
That's Carlotta Valdes.
Well, that explains it. Anyone could develop an obsession for the past, with a background like that.
Knows nothing of a grave out at Mission Dolores, or an old house an Eddy Street, or a portrait at the Palace of the Legion of Honor?
Her mother told me most of then before she died. I dug out the rest for myself, here.
Natural fear. Her grandmother went insane and took her own life. And the blood is in Madeleine.  Scottie, I ask you to watch her closely.
What for? Who are you?
Is this some kind of Gallup Poll, or something?
Why?
You're not far wrong.
Who you are --
No, a year ago! Where did you live a year ago!!?
I want to know who you are.
Why?
Honest?
Yes. Yes, I do.
Ah, no!
It should be back from your face -- with a bun at the neck. I told them. I told you.
I feel like driving. Are you terrible hungry?
Take me away...
No!
Took no chances, did he?  And when you got there, he pushed her off the tower, was that it? But you were the one who screamed. Why did you scream?
Oh, of course I remember that!  But then I must have had a dizzy spell, and fainted!
This afternoon.
I will. You're terribly direct in your questions.
Oh! Yes! Here!
John. Old friends. Acquaintances call me Scottie.
No, I wouldn't like that. And after what happened today I should think you could call me Scottie. Or even John.
Wander about.
Some people prefer it.
No... this is the first time for me, too.
Good morning. I worried about you, last night. You shouldn't have run like that.
Shopping?
Ah.  That's what I was going to do.
Wander separately? Ah, but only one is a wanderer. Two, together, are always going somewhere.
Of course not! I'm a wanderer!  I'd like to go somewhere I've never been!
I didn't jump, I fell! You told me I fell!
A room... there is a room, and I sit there alone... always alone...
A grave...
This part is dream, I think. There is a tower and a bell and... a garden below... but it seems to be in Spain... a village in Spain. And then it clicks off, and is gone.
I'm here, I've got you...
All the time.
I didn't wake him. I don't want him to know...
At the end of the green there was a whitewashed stone house with a lovely pepper tree at the corner --
No, never!
Not merely as it was a hundred years ago. As it was a year ago, or six months ago, whenever you were here to see it.  Madeleine, think of when you were here!
I love you too... too late... too late...
You can't.
Let me go.
Please let me go.
How long has she had the room?
Does she sleep here? Ever?
No three-way stretch? How very un- chic.
No, it's your life. But you were the bright young lawyer who decided he was going to be chief of police some day.
Why?
It's where you belong.
Uh-huh!
Gavin? Gavin Elster? You'd think I'd would. No.
What.
Okay.
Well, who? Come on, you know everybody.
Yeah.
Who?
Nothing to tell.
You haven't told me everything.
Since I stopped being able to get them on the phone. For a man who has nothing to do, you're certainly a busy little bee. Where do you go, these days?
Thank you, Mr. Leibel. Thank you very much.
Yes, it is. Now, I want to look at an evening dress, a dinner dress, black -- short -- long sleeves -- with a neck cut this...  ...and the skirt out. 
Excellent.
That's a horrible ugly comment. "Dead whore?" She's a person!
I didn't hear you.
You're interrupting a personal conversation.
You're an asshole.
She's dead.
You're pathetic.
You have acquaintances - business friends and superficial golf buddies. You have always been a fringe player. You have some serious male on male intimacy problems.
You go home!
You want to hear me out?
You don't know what you're doing.
Just giving the facts.
We can do this. We can get her out of here.
Nobody knows she's here. I called her personally. Nobody knows.
What?
No we're not. The bodies are all mixed up. We can't do this to them.
That is absolutely not true.
Watch the tone fella.
Adam! Calm down.
They won't figure it out.
What?
They've all been real times. And as you prepare to enter into a new phase of life, as you prepare for new roles; father, husband, teacher, you will, as I have, come to except the letting go of of old ways. Soon, the mellowing will begin...
I know and I'm honored...
What happened? Oh my God...
Tomorrow.  We are getting married tomorrow.
Ah, yeah, hi. Is Tina there?
Doing the bachelor party thing?
Sweet deal.
Great. Fine. Perfect.
I'm just gonna let her know I'm here.
We can take her out to Red Rock. Find some quiet place...and put her in the ground.
Here's his head.
Who's up for making some real money?
Shut up.
I'm calling the police.
I think we should say some words over the grave.
I'm talking about prayer.
No, the problem, as I recall, was the lack of blocking...
What you just said. Say it again.
I don't think that's such a good idea.
I'm getting really tired of your bullshit.
You're sick.
The hell you didn't!
What?
Ball park sausages.
We're not goosed.
Goosed!
I love you.
All right then. It's refreshing to see two young people not afraid of real commitment. Will you have friends or family saying words - singing or anything?
I do.
We missed the deadline.
Sent it.
Because you wanted to. You wanted this to be your wedding not your parent's.
It amazes me how organized you and your little fun bunch can be when it comes time to mobilize to Vegas.
He's quiet.
Why? What's his problem?
You're going to be hungover for three days. Like those guys on "Oprah" that get drunk and have disgusting sex with prostitutes and then say their vows with the stench of cheap hotel whore sex all over them.
Go down where?
More than I ever imagined being able to love anyone ever.
I will.
I'm mad at you.
After the wedding, which we're paying for ourselves, and this house...
We're not canceling.
Yeah. You.
No it's not okay. It's not.
Oh Liz. We. God. We, in Vegas. Micheal crushed her skull. She was dead. There was nothing else to do. It was an accident.
The prostitute.
What does that mean?
Do you love me? DO YOU LOVE ME?!
I don't know. She's really been stressing out.
How do you know she's dead.
You can tell when people believe you. It's obvious.
Downstairs in the closet.
Where?
I want a black one. A little black brother. That's a big problem it seems to me. Lack of racial integration. That's a big one. You think?
That's what I'm thinking.
I do.
The stone age.
Drum banging real times.
No, the children sleep with me.
You'd like me to kill them?
What about them?
That one.
Oh, some years ago I heard my mother talking about it. But is it true?
How could anybody behave like that?
And this innocent child.
Today I can refuse you nothing.
It's up to you entirely. Don't leave, then ...
No, it's true.  Last night when you were sleeping, I had you all to myself.
What's the matter?
Just say the word, sir, and I'll do anything.
And in the vegetable plot?
Nothing.
What are you going to do?
That your cousin is more to your taste.
That will teach you not to bother me any more, you son of a bitch.
Why?
Are you Jorge?
I'm not like you, you have your wife.
Leave him alone.
I'll be ready.
I'll take him to the doctor tomorrow. Come on now, sit down and go on eating. And you, look after him as if he were a sick brother. Be understanding. Now finish eating and then go to bed. Everyone in bed by eight o'clock!
Why not?
A black bull came.
Very, very?
You little liar! Get out of here!
Don Jaime loved to watch me skip.
He has paid for your studies and your maintenance, and he has just sent your dowry. Does that mean so little to you, Viridiana?
The retreat will start soon. You can leave tomorrow morning.
Don't pay any attention to him. It's very good.
Hello.
Today, a good girl.
I've discovered something about Lindenmeyer'5 Maestro teaching tool I thought you should know...  The harm done to the music students who used the device -- it was not by accident. The machine was designed explicitly for that purpose. Lindenmeyer intended to hurt the kids using it.
If you try to run, I'll hunt you down and kill you myself.
But only you will know he's not human.
Madison lives two blocks from their present location.
If you can catch him.
What she's going to do is get in my way.
She wasn't part of the deal, Cox.
Their weapons missing?
Where's my gun?
Then I guess we're even.
Until we know what new influences are affecting him, we can't be sure.
The man played judge, jury, and executioner with eight people's lives. He lost control and is capable of doing it again.
If I were you, I'd get every demolition team in the city searching in and around the Biltmore Hotel.
You're the highest law enforcement official in the country. Use the fucking army if you need to.
I'M WHAT?!
Do I get to see it or not?
It's nano-technology, isn't it? Machines the size of molecules...
Show me his physical sensory level.
Think hard -- it'll come to you...
True genius is rarely rewarded within its lifetime.
Of course you are.
In other words, par for the course.  How do you feel about the simulation you participated in yesterday?
Charlie? You say that like you're close, personal friends.
He had a twin brother who was a musical child prodigy who died in an electrical accident at age eight. Lindenmeyer went into an emotional shell until was 17. All he did day and night was play the violin.
For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak with most miraculous organ.
Creating a whole far more dangerous than the sum of its parts.
As a matter of fact, it is.
Thank-you.  Her name is Karin.
Nothing.
Both.
If you're gonna do it, better do it now.
Lindenmeyer?
Who else do you know who touches the world with synthetic hands?
Why's that?
My...secret.
BARNES, YOU'RE DEAD!
<u>Hello</u>.  What?
I could tell you stories:  Cecil B. Demille:  Alright? The Greatest Show on Earth:  He needs an elephant,
Okay.  Okay.  The <u>Suitcase</u> Bomb...
I don't think you're gonna need it.
All we have to do now is sell it to the President.
Come on.
Who's got the story? 
They caught him in the closet with a Girlscout.  Side- effects of a pill ain't gone trump that.  You have to keep'em guessing for  Two weeks.  You  don't have to Cure Cancer, Pal, you just have to give them something more interesting than...
One day, Two days?  <u>Course</u> it's gonna hhhh....
Yeah, I'm gonna have to go to L.A.
....we landing?
We aren't going to have a war.  We're going to have the "appearance" of a war.
Well, I'm <u>working</u> on it....
Tonight.  Well, you've started a Tempest in a Teapot.
Eight Days To Go 
<u>I</u> dunno.... Ambassador to <u>Togo</u>, somethin', <u>I</u> dunno... he...
You missed your <u>plane</u>?  My <u>life</u> is over.  My <u>life</u> is over.  What have you <u>done</u> to me?  What have I done?  Fourteen years of Public Service...
First of all, we're locked <u>in</u> to it, <u>secondly</u>:
No.  No...Pentagon says, Army's got'em, they got'm in ..."Custody"... 
Fine. 
It's the Pride of a Job Well Done, Stanley, yes, but it's <u>more</u> than that.
THE GROUP WATCHING TELEVISION.
...we own it?
Does it <u>have</u> to be Albania?  Because, lookit:  I can get my hands on a lot of walking-around-cash, I think, if it's <u>Italy</u>...Look at the tie-in here:  <u>The</u> <u>Boot</u>, "Givvem the <u>Boot</u>,"... If we were to go Wide with a <u>shoe</u> as the fad.  A "Shoe-fad"...  Here's what it offers us...
Could if we had to.  Rather not.  Rough weather.
Who're you working for?
I have a question for you.
I'll play your silly game.
This ain't the illegal immigrant Nanny.
Where'd you go to school, Kid.  Wellesly?
I'm here, Mr. Moss, because you've shown yourself a great supporter of the Party.
...holding action.  THEY'RE GOING TO TEAR THIS GUY TO <u>Shreds</u>.
Have him say, 'I know we're all concerned for the President, there will he an update at 5:45.'
I'm gonna <u>tell</u> you why...
The... 
Is that true?
...going to War...
And <u>if</u> you never won an Oscar, How'd you like an ambassadorship... 
Well, no, well, you couldn't <u>tell</u> any...
Because.
Oh, he's gonna be Aces.
Some, military... Special Program, Oklahoma somewhere...
Oh, you're gonna love this:
Get it in the stacks at the Library of Congress, Now.  Who's seeing the guy at C.B.S.?
What do you mean he won't do it?  He won't do <u>what</u>?  He won't do the sp...  It's what?  It's <u>corny</u>?  <u>Corny</u>?  Is that the word?  Of <u>course</u> it's corny.  We wouldn't have him <u>say</u> the flippin' thing it wasn't corny.  Put... listen, it's not a question, we're locked <u>in</u> to this speech.  NO We're, Are You Listening?  LOCKED IN.  We're, we're playing way <u>past</u> it, we're <u>past</u> it -- it's the set-up for...he has <u>got</u> to say the speech.  Tell Ames to meet me at the West Gate in... 
Yes, but I, well, <u>you</u> know...
Well, yes, but the guy <u>did</u> bring Peace.
Hey, lemme close out the thing in style.
Big mistake.
They insist they wanna go with meeting him at the airport.  I told'em they're wrong, I can't convince'em. They're concerned that the last kid had the <u>Wheat</u>. Variations include, the kid is a <u>boy</u>, the kid is <u>twins</u>, it's a little <u>dog</u> ... they rub meat on Schumann's cuff, the dog runs to him...
Speaking of that...  We're gonna need a whole lot <u>more</u> of this....
Cause I don't think <u>this</u> dog is gonna hunt....
Yeah, well, perhaps...  Speaking of which:  I have a <u>prescription</u> here, I'm going to give you the <u>number</u>, I need you standing by with a <u>crate</u> of the stuff.... it's ... what is it?
It's an anti-psychotic, the num...  the number...hello...hello...
Is he dead?
Come on, Pal, come on Willie, come on, Old Shoe...
Take ten.
It's too clean.
Why are they ...
Military Special Programs... <u>Programs</u>... No, I am not Shouting at you, I'm... I'm sorry.  Anyone named <u>Shoe</u> Schumann?  <u>Schuster</u>... uh
He ain't seen <u>nothin'</u> yet.
Well, you  said it yourself, earlier, and if I may rephrase, that the success of the President, in the Polls...
Eighty-<u>nine</u> percent favorable, is based not on <u>events</u>...
By the  media, by, yes, by, in this case, our organization.
I'm just talking about the Hats.
...'bout ready to Mix it Up...?
Susie?  Susie.  Are you alright...?  <u>Susie</u>...
SUSIE...?  Are you alright...?
No, I think it's ... can we see the calico <u>kitten</u>...?
What about tipping off Yurovich?
Tell those spineless toads we'll self-insure if they don't write it... You fire 33 vice presidents and nothing changes...  You eating twinkies today, Bud, or are you schtupping some stewardess...
They don't know what's going on!
Give me that phone.  Yes, sir, this is the manager. What seems to be the problem?
I'd love to, Mr. Lynch, thank you.
Yeah, where's your machine gun.
Ah, I had a tough day. Some jerk D.K'd me and I gotta cover his loss.
Coulda been a contender.
50 K don't get you to first base in the Big Apple, Dad, not any more. I pay 40% in taxes, I got a rent of 15,000, I got school loans, car loans, food, park my car costs me 3 bills a month, I need good suits, that's $500 a pop, shoes...
Can you spare three hundred? Pay you back next month, promise.
Not in here Dad... please. Later.
How's Mom?
Damn right, it gets us out from under suspension. We'll get those new routes to Pittsburgh and Boston and the equipment we need. We're gonna compete with the big boys now.
Client. Got a private jet over at Butler Aviation... Dad, you always gotta light up when you see me, it's the...
... Dad, you should've been a CEO. How about dinner?
...gotta run Dad. You stop smoking, you hear?
Maybe that's the price, Bud, maybe so. It's gonna be rough on you but maybe in some screwed up way, that's the best thing that can happen to you...stop trading for the quick buck and go produce something with your life, create, don't live off the buying and selling of others...
...have a nice day Mr. Stone.  ... Mr. Gekko, the conference call is ready. Mr. Sugarman and Mr. Lorenzo in Delaware. Mr. Bernard in Los Angeles. Mr. Jackson and Ms. Rosco in London. They're all on.
Look Dixon, calm down! It's not illegal to buy stock or to be right. And it's not all that unusual to be spot checked on a big buy. Tell him you did your homework and you thought the stock was a sound investment.
Good. Then call him back. And call me back. Don't worry.
Who's listening? It's just one college buddy talking to another.
Too much to do...but I'll walk you out.
...got a strange call from the SEC. They asked to see my records... Bud, this is a heavy...
Can't tell you that, Mr. Gekko.
I know...the decision'll clear the way for new planes and route contracts. There's only a small float out there, so you should grab it. Good for a five point pop.
Bluestar was at 21 and an eighth when I left the office. It might spin up to 25 by the bell...
...put the rest of it in a money market account for now. I want to see what you know before I invest it...and save the cheap salesman talk, it's obvious.
Mr. Gekko, I don't think I can...go on.
What? How do you know about my father?
I remember that deal. You were involved?
Mr. Gekko, I'm there for you 110%.
...Gordon.
I think I got some friends that won't mind making some easy money...
Yeah aren't you forgetting something Gordon: rule one, capital reserves. This company has $75 million cash in an overfunded pension. That buys us a lot of credibility...  ...and the beauty is you already own close to two percent of this sucker...
I'm talking to a stockbroker who wants to run an airline. It's gonna take me two years and 2000 headaches to turn Teldar Paper around, what do I need this dink airline for? I'm up to my ass in more nuts than a fruitcake.
What does that mean?
Sure. What's worth doing is worth doing for money. It's a bad bargain where nobody gains. And if this deal goes through, we all gain.
Dump it.
Aha. Poet or philosopher?
You're not trouble by any chance. Are you?
I'm kidding, I'm kidding, we're still young, Darien. So what's money anyway when everybody's making it, it's all relative. After all, this is not the house in Connecticut, this is just a crash pad good for a couple of years...before we slip our two lovely kids, Yuppie and Fruppie into the Lycee Francaise.
You're so naive Bud, you don't even know. Your dad took care of you. I might've been rich when I was a kid...but my father lost all his money...in the seventies, in the stock market, at the track. He was a lousy gambler...
Get the hell out!
Any better and I'd be guilty.
Jesus, can't make a buck in this market, country's going to hell faster than when that sonofabitch Roosevelt was around... too much cheap money sloshing around the world. The biggest mistake we ever made was letting Nixon get off the gold standard. Putney Drug--you boys might want to have a look at it.
Now that's a crap company, sure you'll make money on the takeover rumor, but what's being created. Nothing. No substance behind it.
No such thing Bud - 'cept death and taxes. Not a good company anymore, no fundamentals. What's going on Bud? Do you know something?  Remember there're no short cuts son, quick buck artists come and go with every bull market but the steady players make it through the bear markets.  You're part of something here, Bud. The money you make for people creates science and research jobs. Don't sell that out.
...just kickin' ass and taking names, Mr. Mannheim.
Harold, you don't mind strolling around the block a couple hundred times, do you?
There came into Egypt a Pharoah who did not know.
Now tell me, why would I want to do that?
Come on, we both like Buddy. But this bleeding heart puppy love act is over the top... It doesn't fit.
I could break you, mate, in two pieces over my knees, you know it, I know it, I could buy you six times ever, I could dump the stock just to burn your ass but I happen to want the company and I want your block of shares. I'm announcing a tender offer at 65 tomorrow, and I'm expecting your commitment.
Yes, I'm sure.  What I need is an older man, something with class, a  little style. Someone who knows how to treat a lady.
It's eleven forty-five let's go
Right. CHINA I need a taking care of,  not `hey how bout a pizza after class babe'.  I'm looking  for something just a little more in a man.  A little `je nes se qua'.
China.  What happened? CHINA Shhh.  It's ok.  I missed you so much.
It's all rather morbid though isn't it?
Thank you Jenkins
Uh, not today Jenkins, I need the fresh air
Too late for that sir.  Give my love to the misses.  Get those bastards!
I don't know.  I really like you and I think you're very attractive.
A little?
Listen Sarah, I think I know what's going on ok.  I went to the waxwork today.I met this man.
Come on Mark MARK Ah hell, why not.  I'll get the maid to write the essays
Hey.
I'll come back all the time.
Mom, I'm sorry.  I wanted to tell you. But it never felt right.
No, he wouldn't.
So much.
No.  But once I heard...
Then why did you?
Well, that's what we're here for.
What do you think?  Guess.
Have you been hurt?
Just fine.  It's a lovely party.
Ohhh yes.  No, no.  Just a little, you know...We're fine.
Who's that?
I don't know.
That I'll just...that one day I'll just...disappear.
Wait!  Don't go...
Very much.
What?
Um...sure.
Yeah.
You must have been very proud.
Listen, I've gotta run.  I just thought I'd stop by and see if you want to take the boat out, say Thursday morning?
I don't...
It's alright.
Nothing.  It wasn't anything.  I've been on edge lately.  Maybe since the accident. And I'd prefer, I really would, to just--
Why?
Relieved?
No.
If she was dangerous before--
I know.
Like what?
Did he say that?
He's trying to put it behind him, Claire. You should too.
I think three...
Norman Spencer.
Yep.
You are...
I know.
Yup.
Tomorrow.
I'd never be able to live with mysel--
Huh?  Absolutely.  Take your time.
There were some noises.  I didn't want to disturb you.
No.  Can you drive me home?  I'll bring you back in the morning.
What kind of whispering?
I do, I do.  I'm sure I'm just...how was your day?
Madame Curie, Jonas Salk, Norman Spencer...
That's...
That's just mean.  Oh.  Jody wanted to know if I could get her some.
Did you call about the Feurs?
What's going on, Claire?
And that means he murdered his wife? This is getting ridic--
What am I looking at?
What do you mean?  Claire, we talked about it.  You didn't want Japanese, I said, Our first date since...
...Don't get all...
...and I don't think I'm some lonely, middle-aged woman cracking up.
Ever since the accident I've been worried that you'd been unhappy, or...
But then you've been so much better...
I will NOT.
Yep.
Are you glad?  I'm glad.
I felt you...looking through me...
I...
In the living room...
But I don't remember.
Not personally.
Stop...
...Oh BULLSHIT.  You had to topple perfect Daddy and that meant perfect wife, perfect family...
How did she know where it was?
Don't think so.
Nothing.
Fine.  I'll do the shopping.
IT'S TRUE.  That's...you have to believe me!  Oh God, I'm telling you the truth!  I did what I had to, Claire.  She was gone.  There was nothing I could do for her.  I did...I put her in the lake.  I rolled the car in...and I watched it sink.  And I've lived with that image ever since.  I couldn't just stand there while everything-- my career, us, everything, just washed away.  Don't you see, Claire?  She's doing this!  This is exactly what she wants you to think!
You've been shadowing the family for thirty years.  It's only fitting you give one af us away.
But why would they do that...?
Rowan's already called the hotel, Michael.  At the cemetery by now, I would guess.
With her family.  Rowan's mother died yesterday.
Every day  twice.
Yes.    Listen carefully, Rowan. Have your attorney contact me at once. There are matters of immediate -
I had you sent away.
A very tired one.  I've been up all night - and I would .like to rest before the funeral.     Have your lawyer -
I want to see my mother.  Where is she...?
And this - if you decide to take the rest.
She didn't feel them
It wes a dream...!
I'm NOT like you!  I'm NOT! You're cruel -
Wind - I love you with that which is endless within me.  Bring me your eyes - your touch - your voice...
Michael...  Help us...  The door!
Explain this to me --- violated...?
Wrong...?  Science is not magic.
Tell me what I am, Rowan.
They want to come back.    We have a pact - of mutual desire and  consent.  The Mayfairs ar. a beautiful tapestry.  I have weaved you all together - from the start.   I brought Petyr Van Abel to Suzanne.  He had genius in him.  Scientific, precise.  It was a perfect start. And on  it has gone - father to mother... sister to brother... father to daughter...
Ju1ien was your father   Your great-grandfather - your grandfather - and your father. All one in the same...  That is why he fought carlotta for your life.
'Kill you...?'  You are my mother.  Do you think I would hurt you...?
Rowan...
Really...?  Your family there...?
Captain's orders.
You stop it.  you're loving, and gentel..  You're the most remarkable woman I've ever met --- so stop telling me I don't know what I feel just cause you're scared.  Cause it won't work.
Listen.  Last night - oh Christ, this'1l take forever to explain. God, Michael...
Wait a minute.  Rowan - what is going on...?
Michael - I saw him!  Twice!  Carlotta said I  ---  killed Graham - with - with my anger.
Is it more or less crazy than dying and coming back to life with hands that can see...?  God, Michael --- what am I...?
Rowan...   Think of what's in that book.  Think of last night!
I'm soon to be a very wealthy witch.
Let's see.
Hello..
Than letts get rnarried, Michael.  I could put a spell on you - and make you say yes.
And I thought I was the mindreader.
That's GREAT!
Their what...?
A little wine...?
Dropped it.
Gotcha.
It's not true.  You have to believe me.
I just - hate it when they're - finished.
You can't just -
Just nervous.  Getting married, you know.     Got the rings...?
Just don't fall off any ladders.
Papers...?
As long as you get the HACKSAW piece done by FRIDAY... FRIDAY?
You know that circulation is down for three months in a row.
Don't mention it - now can I get back to my accounts, or do you want to fillet me?
BRIAN...
Then we would have to call in our locksmith to break the lock
No - not all the time - I mean
It says in the contract I can have a lock fitted - is there a problem ANGELA?
I think I will pass...
my car  I stopped working from my car.  She could have stopped me you know - If she really wanted too. That is the difference between the confusion of humanity and the purity of the beast - If a dog attacked you - you could easily kill it without any damage to yourself - Why then do people get bitten by dogs - savaged? Why?
I don't want to talk about it -
I hated being treated like a failure - looked down on - my sister used to do that - I hated it - I should have known, when we got married - in a registry office of course - she wore maroon - I just wanted a white wedding  I think she thought I was a ticket to the good life. I had a good job, prospects. And she was a slut - I didn't know until too late. One day, I came
STEPHANIE?
I know this sounds insane ELLEN, but... Telling you all of this, writing the book... It feels good. Don't get me wrong - I feel like a weight is being lifted from my shoulders... When I tell you what I have done - I can't believe it is me...Yet I know it was. This is like a purging for me...
Demons... This wouldn't have been possible without you... You have given me incentive ELLEN - I can see clearer now...
Out - I may be some time
I am sorry...
Yes - I suppose so...
No thanks - 
What was I supposed to do?
Nothing LESLIE - I just think we should wait...
You killed my friend!
No - I'll have you after
I think he's fine - I don't know why you have this thing about men - it would be nice to have a guy in the house for a change - I don't think he would hurt a fly.
Yes I can...
What's this all about?
Oh...
Yes - one please.
She smiles at everyone, Ted.  She's like a newborn with gas.
Nobody knows about your mental retardation.
Perv.
Not ever. Never.
Yeah, whatever.
Then there must be a whole room, made completely of chocolate.
Sorry. Ginger got a little, you know, enthusiastic.
With a refrigerated cargo bed full of sirloin tip.
We wanted to challenge the notions of classic beauty. We wanted to showcase women throughout the world.
Except the girl. The only one that really mattered.
God, I love being dead.
From your lips, to God's ears.
Do it?
We want you to go to college, find a career you love, marry a nice girl from a nice family, and live happily ever after.
It was the year of the rhizopus rot. Grandpa almost lost the farm. You sacrificed your dream to go to the prize hog festival. And in the end you saved the peaches and you didn't have to slaughter your sow.
Just say it, Dad.
You ordered a Winnebago?
I don't have much experience with a...uh...stick.
I don't even know if I should be doing this. It's a very expensive car.
I know.  I'm Ginger. Miss April.
What do you mean? I'm Ted Nelson.
Whatever you want.
What do you want me to do?
Hang in there, I'll think of something.
I guess...I don't know...I guess we should leave if we're not wanted.
If you're anything like yours truly, then you probably figure we didn't want you when you were born, so who cares if we're dead? Am I right?
We had no idea the nudie magazine we started in the garage would turn into all this.
What about the future? You planning to rock the boat at all? Stir things up in "Heaven?"
I see, so you'd be open to little ladies from Pasadena, who want to show you their knickers?
She knew exactly where you were staying, which you neglected to tell me, your own brother.
So, what brings you here at his hour?
My room?
You want it in writing?
Aside from the fact that Mom's eyes are nearly swollen shut from crying and Dad spends all his time under the car trying to fix stuff that isn't broken, things couldn't be better.
It's so nice to have FRIENDS like you, Christy.
Then I'll write about YOU.
Different how? Different like a dwarf at a basketball game? Or different like a lesbian in pumps?
And this is not my first time on a private jet, so quit acting like I'm Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm.
Well? Where the hell are you?
You expected whips, chains, Merk being cattle-prodded by some dominatrix in a leather hood?
My desire betrays me, like goosebumps on my flesh.
Wearing them?  Or humping them?
Sounds, voices, music, humming. All of it can turn me on, or off, like a switch.
The thing is, I made a commitment. I said I'd do it and I have to keep my word.
I graduated from college. Did great, summa cum laude and all. And I'm about to launch a brand new magazine called "EXPOSED!"  An homage to Miss Julie Conroy of Xenia, Ohio.
Yellow pages?
No cursing in this house, young man. Use the strong vocabulary God gave you.
What? Having spring break ruined by will readings?
Charlie, at a will reading? What did I do to deserve this?
What is all this? When are you coming home?
I'll make you very proud.
But how would we pay our bills?
I guess you won't be wanting that Rolex I sent you, then?
A new pediatric wing at the hospital? A presidential campaign? Name it. Anything.
Mr. Nelson, you disappoint me. First you break our school board rules. Then you break the law.
Me? The King of Coitus?
My parents always say hard work builds character.
That's perfect.
I'm Ted Nelson. I guess you already know that part.  For two years I've been the editor of the high school paper in Xenia, Ohio. I've won some awards, made a difference. I've always had journalism in my soul. Now I know why.
I can't wait to see the pictures.
We've got a huge problem with the magazine, Ted-baby. Our readers hate it. HATE IT. We need to talk.
My job. Back off, Benedict.
People pay good money for that?
I'm terrible at this. I blurt. I'm a blurter. Your parents...They ...well...they exist no further.  Skinny-dipping. The Amazon. Piranhas. It wasn't pretty.
It's spring break. I don't want to go to a will reading.
I'm seventeen. I know it like the back of my hand.
Kelly Van Ryan...
Second you get something on those teeth, I want it
Take your time.
Was there penetration?  Did he put himself inside you?
He was large?
I... he had my wrists pinned behind me. I remember my hands were cold.'
He kept saying, "Let it happen, let it happen."  Then he just stopped.
I know one thing he said.  It was when... when he took himself out and was standing up.  He said, "Don't worry, I didn't come." I can't forget that.  He said, "No little girl can ever make me come."
I'd like that.
Again.  I think we covered this.  I told her I was going to call a cab.
Suzie Toller is missing.
Hunter's making it our job because Sandra Van Ryan's got a bug up his ass. You know that as well as I do.  We're gonna trash this guy's life and I keep asking myself if it's really necessary.
It's a shithole.  But she was dirty, what was I gonna do?
I mean something bad, Gloria, something bad you saw coning, and you didn't do anything, and then it happened.  I did that once.  I don't want to do it again.
The blood type on the rocks matches Suzie's.
We need to tape the interview, Suzie. No one will see it but us.  Now when was this, that Mr. Lombardo gave you the ride?
And when he arrived at your house, was anyone there?
You know what that will mean for Lombardo.
You think this is just about money, about us looking foolish?  Question him. You're gonna find a stone cold manipulative psychopath.  And those girls are going to wind up dead...
Bit, scratched.  But I had her pinned. She calmed down.  I was going to cuff her... She said she thought she was going to be sick.  She asked to use the bathroom.
Hey, you're working for it.  Least you're supposed to be.
You and Suzie used to come out here together?
Lombardo ever come out here?
No.  But I mean... just the idea that Mr. Lombardo would...
Are you retarded, or just brain dead from whiffin' fumes out there in the swamp...
Nothing.
Curiosity, I guess.
You all gonna go down to the Caribbean together?
I'm not on your property!
Whichever one I want.
Deal.  You know, I just looked out front.  My ride wasn't there.  You suppose you could give me one?
Hey, come on... We've got to have at least one victory party.
Stick?
Yes.
Why can't you come...
You know what it takes.
And you believe her?
That's not your line.
Sound nice?  It's a fucking drug rehab farm.  It's where Kelly Van Ryan went when her morn fished her out of the swamp.  Meanwhile, you get educator of the year I mean there's no way they can put this thing in front of a jury.  Shit, they haven't even taken your statement yet.  Reason?  They're still shoveling dirt and my guess is, they're coming up empty.  Now tell me I'm right.
You can't...
Then he'll be back at Blue Balls?
I don't have to listen to this.  And you can't shove me around.  I have friends now...
In cutoffs, a wet T-shirt.
But you can't tell us what she wanted to talk about.
Yes, we call it a winch.  And these are shrouds, and these are stays.
Come on, man.  I'll make a sailor out of you yet.
Are you mad at me?
The guy was history when he killed Kelly.  You knew that.
That was the same thing Ray said.
We?
Walter.  He's been aimin' that Brownie through knotholes for years.  I saw these, I knew he'd finally struck gold.  I can't decide which came out better, that little straw Kelly's got up her nose, or that vibrator you've got up her ass.  What do you think, Mr. Lombardo?
What?  Running over alligators with that silly swamp jalopy when you could be sailing a real boat...
Your train?  Listen, friend, you're obviously lost.  ... I've got orders here to take possession of this train and to investigate a certain crime.
You need that real often?
I'll work on it.
Aha?
Prepare what?
Whoa, Jim.  Maybe.  But we can't arrest this little pillar of society on maybe.
Then we've got our proof. Excellent.  And where do we find this fortunate scientist?
Hey, I tried the board.
Nothing much to it really.  When I was younger I got into a pretty bad run-in with the Wyler Boys.  I saw them coming.  But I didn't act fast enough.  Second-guessed myself. And it cost me... cost me dearly.
It's not a guy...
You said it popped out too easily. Nothing's ever good enough for you, is it?
Oh, thank you.
I'd love to stop him, but have you noticed the hundred armed men?
Like hell!  I'll see it through! Ram the bastard!
We'll see.
Here.  Mr. Tyler.  He claims a certain skill at handling firearms.
My... the wild west.
Your guests, ma'am?
Well, I owe you one, don't I?
I don't like to lose, either.
Well, Captain, then the answer is your train is still here.
On my way to Denver...
Talk?  About what...?  Oh!  About who you are and all that?
Has it penetrated that adrenaline- addled skull that you are surrounded by seventy-eight of my loyal followers?  You are in my domain!
Who was this partner of his?
It's a smelting retort.
You don't know what he's built?! Surely you don't think he kidnapped all those geniuses to have them make something as rudimentary as this.
They're coming.
You're not going to use it, are you?
Nothing you wouldn't have done it my place!
Least I'm not down there herding sheep!
You managed alright.
They're not after me.  They want the baby.
She belongs to all of us.  She is the future queen and ruler of all kingdoms on earth.
Me?
What is Tir Asleen?
My prsence cannot extend beyond this forest.  But I can give you these...
No.  I mean yes.
My step-father's going to tear you apart.
Madmartigan.
Why.
These burns.  My arms.  Ouch...
Friend of yours?
Absolutely!
Don't worry, Willow.  She's in good hands.  You haven't made a mistake.
Yes it does.  The Fairy Queen told me.
She can't be wrong.  She's a very very very powerful sorceress.
No, it's too big to be a Nelwyn baby.  It looks like a daikini...
Daikinis are giant people who live far far away.
What a great son you are, Ranon.  I wish I could take you with me.  Now go to sleep...
I can't remember all these things. What am I learning?
That's the life spark.  Exxence of magic and sorcery!
No!  Change me back into a sor- ceress, Willow.
He never misses.
Me neither!
Us??  We'll never catch them.  Any- way, we're all done, Teemo.  Let's go home.
I know she's hungry.  I tried to feed her but she wouldn't eat a thing.  I'm not a wet nurse.
Who??
I can't see anything--she's too bright!
How do these work I wonder?  I got- ta save one to show the High Aldwin.
Not one this big.
Sorry. It's important.
That's none of your goddamn business! So keep your goddamn holier-than- thou mouth shut!  Anyway, they like Fred.
John, I don't understand any of this.
It's been a while.
Pretty much.
Yes, sir.
Pick up the hat.
No... I saw the man who killed him.
You don't say.
It's them, Sam.  Now, Sam, listen to me and listen to me carefully. Listen to me as you never listened before.
Zenovitch was about to deliver a list of names tonight - street chemists... the guys processing this P2P into speed.
Maybe.
The Amish boy saw him, Paul. I'll make it, but Set Donahue and the Homicide Department off my back or they'll blow the whole thing.
Tell you what... why don't you and that blonde - what's-her-name - come over for dinner Sunday. How 'bout that.
Well, anyway, don't get crazy.  I'll do something for Zenovich's wife.
I hope you don't have any doubts about that.
A hot shower... I haven't changed clothes in two days.
How bad did Mac get you? We figured pretty bad.
Johnny -
Listen to me, Johnny. Come in! You're out there all alone... We're getting close... real close... Maybe if you listen to me for a minute we can work something out so you can come in -
No you're not -  You're glad, because now you've got a witness.  I heard the other police talking last night.  They don't seem to like you very much.
Listen, I'm the cop that polices the police. I'm not in the business of protecting crooked cops.  I'll make an arrest when I know everybody involved.
Because - somehow - they knew I was getting close.  Look, it's narcotics... They make dope out of chemicals... they sell it on the street for millions of dollars. They'll do anything.  And they can get away with it because they're cops.
I can whack people. I'm hell at whacking.
Now hold on. There's a lot of people who think being a cop is a legitimate job.
I see.  But I hope you have a lot of sugar.  Eli is ready to go to Zook's.
I'm leaving tonight.  I'm going to need my clothes. And my gun.
Aren't you? After today?
Land! Are you crazy? I'm no Amishman and I'm no farmer! I'm a cop. That's what I know and that's what I do!
Let's just find Coalmine.  Listen, Zenovich made a mistake. You didn't let anybody down. It happens -
I hear you.
I hear you. I'll stay in touch.
Say again?
Probably.
He's got my number.
He accused John of taking kickbacks. And you know - anybody who knows John - knows that's a goddamn lie!
At home you'd never hear a woman scream at a man that way.
We'll pray that he doesn't die! But if he does, then we'll find a way so no one knows!
I know God help me, I know that, Eli.  But I tell you that if he's found here, the people who did this to him will come for Samuel.
Eh? Well then, maybe he can go to Zook's barn-raising, eh? See how good a carpenter.
All right, where is he?
If she...
You'll be hist...
Please, sir.  We've done what you told us. We've brought you the broomstick of the Wicked Witch of the West.  We melted her.
All in good time, my little pretty -- all in good time.
Well, I'm a little muddled.  The Munchkins called me because a new witch has just dropped a house on the Wicked Witch of the East.  And there's the house, and here you are, and that's all...
Then close your eyes, and tap your heels together three times.
Please, Professor, why can't we go along with you?
Nobody cares about me at home. They wouldn't even miss me.
No, they won't - honestly.
Has it poppies on the wall....
Oh, no -- no!
I'm afraid I'm a little rusty yet.
Oh, goodness! Did any of them sting you?
Oh, dear. I don't know what I'd do if a whole swarm kept -- Oh! Oh! Oh, there's one on me!
Oh! Oh!
I'm sure he could give you some courage.
Oh!  Oh, Tin Man!   Oh!
Look -- it ticks!
Lions and tigers and bears!
The nerve.
Look!  He's rusted again.  Oh, give me the oil can -- quick!  Oh-oh, quick!
And -- and I got a permanent just for the occasion.
Not nobody, not nohow!
Oh, well, then -- we'll ask him for you.
Oh, come on.
Oh, Hunk, you just won't listen, that's all.
Where's Kansas?
Witch?  Huh!  I'm not afraid of a witch! I'm not afraid of anything --- except a lighted match.
Yes --- there.
Oh, you don't think we're going to stand by and let her get away with fireballs and bees, do you?
Of course, I don't know, but I think it'll get darker before it gets lighter.
Oh, no -- please.  I have to rest for just a minute.  Toto!
Oh, he's been crying! Why have you been --
Ohh!  OHH!  OHH!
You do? boys, you're aiming low. You not only surprise, but you grieve me.
I'd show him who was King of the Fores'!
Somebody pulled my tail.
I -- Oh --
Don't stand there talking!  Put me together! We've got to find Dorothy!
Imposserous!
It's a whatzis?
Yeah --
Don't push!
Ohhhhhh!
We do.
Some -- but mostly lions, and tigers, and bears.
A heart --
Hurry -- hurry --
Don't cry -- you'll rust yourself again!
It's the Wicked Witch!  What'll we do? Help!  HELP!
Oh - look out.
It's a whozis?
Well, that's you all over.
You put up a great fight, Lion.
Well, I --
Yes. Viktor Davidov, Miss...?
Elektra King.
Elektra would control it all.
Just wanted to put him on edge...
We can't.
I need you to pass me fit now, Molly.
Caviar capital of the world. Matchless beluga. Firm, yet subtle.  Largest landlocked body of water on Earth.  Oil-rich.  Hitler wanted it. Stalin beat him to it.
Renard.
He's not through yet. Renard doesn't blow up five million dollars unless he knows there's more coming in. He's working for someone. Someone who wants to stop the pipeline.  And they hired the perfect killer. One with a vendetta against King...and you.
The inside man?
Your last chance. Give me the name.
Yes.
Funerals aren't exactly memorable.
That's every man within a five mile radius.  Including you.  That's why you're here, isn't it? You think I can't do it. You think I'm going to screw up. Or get myself killed.
I have to go.
You had your chance, James. Now I'm looking for a bigger thrill.
Really?
I used my body on the guards.  It gave me control. I got to a gun and I took my chance.  I've never told anyone that.
Oh James.
You are out of your league.  She's working with Renard.
This is a family matter! If my nephew is in danger, we do it my way, or nothing! Now get me out!
To haul some cargo. My nephew, he is Captain of a sub in the Black Sea Fleet.
It's heading for the oil terminal.
Still no contact yet.
Don't call me that.
Why, doctor.  I did.  He was a bad dog.
God isn't there to do it.
Oh?  The CTU suspects a Libyan hit squad.
Life and death are unquantifiable abstracts.  They don't concern me.
You mean Afghanistan?  It won't require my attention.  What I'm doing here is far more interesting.
Collect me?
Jesus, Jon, I nearly choked to -- where are we --
Please, Laurie.  Not yet.  I've got eons stretching before me, a universe to explore.  I'll be alone.  You're the last human being I'll ever see.
I won't do that.
I see what the watchmaker made.  I see the universe!
My God.  Murdered?  -- What's this have to do with Rorschach?
If he comes here, I'll handle him.  Remember -- I've always protected you.  Haven't I?  Do you need money?
I don't know, but . . . in the wake of all that's happened, I'm starting to think Rorschach may have been right.  Is Laurie okay?
The missing scientists.
Now wait.  We all had the same option as Blake.  It was work for the government or do time.
Well, that was Adrian's idea.  I know he's the smartest man in the world and all that, but -- talk about publicity hounds . . .
Maybe not, but why take chances?
I'm gonna take a warm bath and sack out.  -- You've been really sweet.  Sleep tight, okay?
His . . . whatever.
Are you kidding?  If they put him in jail he's dead.  He'll never get to trial.
I know what you're thinking.  You'd be a lot safer if I weren't around.
Long as we're on the subject of perverts . . .  I miss Rorschach.  Let's spring him.
Wherever we are, it's better than what we left.  Backs together --
Rorschach, that was a long time ago.  I mean, that -- that's just paranoia.
Adrian.  It's too late.  The world is blowing up as we stand here.
With lots of ketchup?
We should get back to the lab.  You okay, Jon?
Oh sweetheart, just a quick one.
Then why don't you ask him?!?
What are you saying?  That Jon is radioactive?
That's it.  This is all a trick, isn't it?  Some kind of horrible joke to make me --
I'll take a raincheck, Laurie.
I know.  I shouldn't be saying this.  He's happy, he's content, he's doing his work --
I suppose I'm serving my purpose, aren't I.  I'll ring for the guards.
Dr. Manhattan, right.  Now if you boys care to join me, we'll go save the world.
The name's Gibbons. You were saying?
Good for you. Now why don't you stop wasting my time and tell me what you want. You didn't go through all this for my benefit.
A Fed, I shoulda known. Who else would have this kind of budget? Now you're gonna hit me with the sales pitch.
You're a cold piece of work. You almost got three people killed out there.
I'm not interested. I've already got a job.
There's some folks I want to keep tabs on. Dirty, tattooed, uncivilized. Your kind of people.
Fine, but I'm not gonna be no Bulldog Omega 5.
Crude and defiant as always, Triple X. It fits so well because you're obscene.
Just remember, I'll be watching.
If you're trying to push my buttons, you're on the right track. Don't make me question my own judgment, X.
Hey, one miracle at a time. They're on to me now, remember?
You're a grungy little phoenix, you know that? Keep up the good work.
Silent Night is the name of a top secret binary nerve agent. The glass canister is shot into the air and detonated. The black and white chemicals mix, forming a toxic cloud. When it settles down to Earth, it'll kill everything in the vicinity.
You're a jerk-off, you know that?
That's exactly why we need them.
We're anti-social. We don't have any friends.
You saving me? You talking pretty tough for a guy got himself chained to the ceiling.
You wanna check it out? Come here.
Kirill, the sniper. Looks like a bookworm, but he had 72 confirmed kills in Chechnya, they called him the "Finger of God". Assassination and weapons.
I have Japanese buyers who are looking to move a fleet, if you have the quality of merchandise they're after. And it's a mil two, max.
Why are you still hanging around? Your business is finished, you should go home.
I don't know who you are or where you come from, but I don't like you. You ask too many questions.
The eyes don't lie. All this has gotten to you, hasn't it, Petra? You came in as Yorgi's girlfriend and you stayed because it was fun. Now you don't like it so much, but you're in so deep you can't get out anymore. Tell me if I'm wrong, Petra.
Don't judge a comic book by it's cover.
We could work together. Then maybe we could both get the hell out of here. There's a beach in Bora Bora with my name on it.
There's something I didn't have time to tell you before.
A long time ago I learned how to put fear away in a little place in my head. Maybe that's my problem. If you don't feel fear you can do some amazing things, but you can also screw your life up in ways you can't imagine.
You don't have to do that.
Aren't they gonna wonder were you've been?
Let me guess, they had a big white torpedo with them.
A piece of shrapnel hit me.
Perhaps he is not all he says he is.
Why don't we go below decks and work off some of this adrenaline.
They come in any other styles or colors?
That one I'm real familiar with.
I'm through, Xander.
Of course I'm serious. I bought it, didn't I?
Here we go again.
Ferrari's, Lamborghini's... high end pasta rockets. Ten to start.
That's what I'm talking about, man! That's why Anarchy 99 was born.
It's a beautiful town, Prague. It's been good to me.
Don't forget goatee boy. I greased him up on the diamond run.
Oh just shoot us already. I'm sorry I asked.
... until he found tungsten.
I don't like him being here.
His vital signs are weak and getting weaker.
No.  I'm...  I don't know if we can do this without Charles.
Into the Hudson?
It's too far.
I wanted to talk to you.
What if they're naughty?
I can assure you, there is no such creature in my genes.
What do you want?
In the road to survival, there is always sacrifice Logan.  We are the future... not them.  We must protect ourselves.  After tonight, when the leaders of the world return home -- They will return as brothers, as mutants... and our cause will be theirs.  This is survival, I know you understand that, Logan... or is it Wolverine?
To find Rogue.
Actually, Magneto helped me put it together.
I'll go.
The sun is setting, Logan.  You've been asleep for nineteen hours.
Enough for a test.
ALIVE.
Let's just say that I am out to make some radical changes.  Now come on Charles.  For old times sake, for your sake...  Leave him to me.
What do you mean to do?
I know.
Victor Frankenstein.
Probably just some nearby cottage. Nothing to worry about.
MMmmm.
Hello...?
Yes.
Very....very!
You're incorrigible!
Goodbye, darling!
Love you! ...Well, why don't we turn in?
Yes.  I am a bit tired, after all.
Does that include the key to the laboratory?
This is the only library I know of.
I put her in the guest room, just down the hall.
This wire came while you were gone. Your fiancee will be arriving any moment.
A week.  Ten days at most.
Saturday night then!  I'll take the train to New York and fly from there.
Well sir... I'm not sure I understand the distinction between 'Reflexive' and 'Voluntary' nerve impulses.
You are talking about the gibberish ravings of a lunatic mind.
Nineteen!  My dear young man... once the human organism has ceased to function, nature has deemed that creature to be dead.
I am a scientist...!  not a philosopher.
But your grandfather's work, sir...
Fron kon steen!
No, it's pronounced Fron kon steen.
What hump?
I wonder what's got into them?
'How I Did It.'  Good title!
Could be raining!
Yes.  Dr. H. Delbruck.
Tonight?
Wait till he sees the bill.
Ayegor!  Find out where that music is coming from as quietly and as blindingly fast as you can.
What did you find out?
I'll bet it's a doozy.
It's alive!
For  God's sake -- go on!  Are you trying to make me look like a fool. Sing, you amateur!  Sing!!
Yes, you may... but don't make any noise.
All right then, quietly!  Close your robe and stay right behind me. Don't make a sound!
Well, this explains the music.
Yes!
I think you've done it, master.
Me?  Sing?
Wonderful?  It's terrible! Terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible!
What's wrong, Doctor?  You seem... lonely.
Not fooling around.
And I have mine.
It wouldn't be fair to her.
His schwanzstucker.
You can't expect to iron out all the kinks in one night.
Four
Sounds like visitors.  It's all right -- Frau Blucher will show them in.
Igor -- the clock!  Hurry!
Food!
So, you got it in the line of dooty.. ... point taken.
Could be.  Across the river into Zululand. . They might just be waiting there for us to show up... .them stabbing assegais pointing right at our bellies!....
So attack is your defence. Well let's hope Cetshwayo will offer his Impis full destruction.
Eleven o'clock, My LorJ 42
And the threat of counter invasion no longer exists? 40
Certainly, Sin
Well, my horses are feeding, as you may observe, Mr Coghill. It'll take a little while.
Which one?
