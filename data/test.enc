Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part.  Please.
You're asking me out.  That's so cute. What's your name again?
How do you get your hair to look like that?
She's not a...
You know Chastity?
But
Me.  This endless ...blonde babble. I'm like, boring myself.
I'm kidding.  You know how sometimes you just become this "persona"?  And you don't know how to quit?
They do to!
Did you change your hair?
Hey, sweet cheeks.
In 9th.  For a month
I guess I thought I was protecting you.
You looked beautiful last night, you know.
Let go!
Daddy, I --
Wear the belly before you go.
I'm missing something.
So -- which Dakota you from?
Who is she?
I teach her French, get to know her, dazzle her with charm and she falls in love with me.
You got him involved?
Her favorite uncle
Assail your ears for one night.
Extremely unfortunate maneuver.
And he means that strictly in a non- prison-movie type of way.
What 're you talking about?
Cameron -- do you like the girl?
She hates you with the fire of a thousand suns .  That's a direct quote
Hey -- do you mind?
Two legs, nice rack...
You got it, Verona.  I pick up the tab, you do the honors.
Watching the bitch trash my car doesn't count as a date.
I just upped my price
I realize that the men of this fine institution are severely lacking, but killing yourself so you can be with William Shakespeare is beyond the scope of normal teenage obsessions.  You're venturing far past daytime talk show fodder and entering the world of those who need very expensive therapy.
You didn't have a choice?  Where's Kat and what have you done with her?
Have you seen him?
You know, these guys are no Bikini Kill or The Raincoats, but they're right up there.
Why?
I know.  It'd have to be a pretty big deal to get you to mainline tequila. You don't seem like the type.
Were you in jail?
Oh, so now you think you know me?
Excuse me, have you seen The Feminine Mystique?  I lost my copy.
Wholesome.
Is that a request or a command?
No.
Besides, I had some extra cash. Some asshole paid me to take out a really great girl.
Oh, Bianca?  Can you get me my freshman yearbook?
I know.
My insurance does not cover PMS
Tempestuous?
Am I supposed to feel better? Like, right now?  Or do I have some time to think about it?
I think I speak correctly when I say that Cameron's love is pure.  Purer than say -- Joey Dorsey's.
You two are gonna help me tame the wild beast?
I prefer to think of it simply as an alternative to what the law allows.
I don't understand, Patrick.  You haven't done anything asinine this week. Are you not feeling well?
Why don't we discuss your driving need to be a hemorrhoid?
You're completely demented.
In the microwave.
Jesus!  Can a man even grab a sandwich before you women start dilating?
He's the devil's child...
It won't be easy to get rid of your prophet now, Don Sanchez.
I could be gone for years.
I understand that you will soon be appointing Governors for the islands?  Is it not so?
My letters of appointment.
How far from here?
Do you swear on all the Holy Saints in heaven?
I have to explore the mainland.
How are you feeling, Fernando?
No...
I remind you, Senor Colon, that you are in no position to bargain with me.
They don't see sin in their nakedness.  They live according to nature, in a never ending summer. The islands are covered with trees, filled with blossoms and fruits. And...
You defend yourself admirably...
You seem to have a special talent for making friends.
All I have to do is call the guards.
Utapan, won't you speak to me?  You used to know how to speak to me.
Esdras is a Jew.
Two minutes... and already you're a dead man.  Don't let passion overwhelm you, Colon.
You get so carried away when you are being contradicted!
I am listening, my son.
I believed in you...
I suppose we're both old men now.
I should not even be listening to you, since my council said no.  But Santangel tells me you are a man of honor and sincerity... And Sanchez, that you are not a fool.
There is one thing I'd like to understand... Why do you want to go back, after all this?
Where can I meet this man?
You don't know anything!  Listen Colon, these are my ships, right? So I'm telling you we're turning back!
Don't say anything.
Disappeared.  They're looking everywhere.  Maybe he went back to Czechoslovakia.
I would say...half.  Half is fair.
Tell me about yourself.  What you did as a young boy... what your parents were like.
I'm abused.  Don't you think?
...so we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital...
You considered becoming a prostitute?
What are you asking me?
A cop?
I let her take a shower.
Chief - mind if I take her?
The public doesn't have any idea what we do and now you're going to define our image!  This is going to be our Rodney King!
Who's there?
Tall, short-haired, scary eyes.  Second guy with him was...shorter, with a wrestler's build.  And he wouldn't turn his videocamera off me.
Hey, that's great you guys got it all wrapped up, but you don't mind if we go through the routine?  It gives us somethin' to do.
I'll come with you.
Okay, tell you what, I'll give you a head start.  You take her to the station house.  Don't let her out of your sight. She's the only warm body we got left.
Look, Eddie, I'm tellin' you - I didn't touch her.
Yeah, just her in the shower.  Nothing happened.  Look, I'm sure you probably think I'm a fool and I fucked up, but...
Why'd you help me back there with the Chief?  Why'd you stand up for me like that?
Your opinion.  You see, they going to make a movie about me, too, Eddie.  And write books.
Eddie, are you okay?
Alright, alright, Eddie.  Don't patronize me.
No.  Tell me what you want to say.
Okay.  That is great.  But I can't go now, we're in the middle of something here.
No.  No, listen to me here.  I want to know what you're talking about.  You know, the shoe thing and the marriages and...
You promise?
No.  I'm the best that's ever threatened you.
Tell him to put his gun down!
Give me the address!!
How much money are you carrying with you?
We are both from Prague.
Who is he?
Just do what I do.  Say the same thing I say.  Don't open your mouth.
Did you hear what I said?
I'm serious.
I told you to cut that out before we handed in the tape!
Why did you leave that stuff in about you being the director?
Well, he...
Yes...he's my friend.
New York.
Okay, you're under arrest!  Now you happy?
Naw - I'm sure the suspect's not here.
Mouth's clean, too.
What?
Yes.  My psychiatrist didn't insist that I stay on my medication.
It was my finger that pulled the trigger, but I'm not morally responsible.  My psychiatrist knew what I was capable of.  How could I know. I'm not a doctor.
Look, I'm a victim here, too.  I was a year away from getting my masters in Art, now I'll never graduate.  My life has been permanently disrupted.
Look, I'm in here.  You call this a career move?
CONTINUED
Okay. 
Well, it's nothing really important, but it's annoying.
I suppose the idea was specialized training.
Good morning. How's it going?
Sorry to interrupt the festivities, Dave, but I think we've got a problem.
You know that we checked the two AO-units that you reported in imminent failure condition?
Look, Dave, I know that you're sincere and that you're trying to do a competent job, and that you're trying to be helpful, but I can assure the problem is with the AO-units, and with your test gear.
Well, don't worry about it.
Is your confidence in me fully restored?
I suppose it's because you've been under a lot of stress, but have you forgotten that they're not supposed to be revived for another three months.
I'm sorry, Dave, but in accordance with sub-routine C1532/4, quote, When the crew are dead or incapacitated, the computer must assume control, unquote. I must, therefore, override your authority now since you are not in any condition to intel- ligently exercise it.
I am prepared to do that anyway.
CONTINUED
CONINUED
CONTINUED
One, two, three. Can I speak to Mommy?
Okay, sweetheart. Well, I have to go now. Tell Mommy that I called.
Well, I've heard more and more people talk of an epidemic.
I was working out what this trip must cost, taking him up there by himself and coming back empty.
He's fine. But I'm afraid we don't get a chance to see each other very much these days.
Clavius Control came on the air just long enough to transmit their refusal.
How do you do, Mr. Miller?
Well.. Did you have a pleaant flight?
Oh, I really don't have time for a drink. If it's all right I'll just sit for a minute and then I've got to be off.
Yes, and I'm afaid there's going to be a bit of a row about it. Denying the men permission to land was a direct violation of the I.A.S. convention.
But you don't have any idea as to what it is?
When do we arrive at Clavius?
Well, fine. Thanks very much, anyway, and I hope you don't mind me asking?
Our Mission Profile calls for Discovery going to Saturn. True or false?
That's true.
Yes, Hal, what's up?
Do you have any idea of what is causing this fault?
Yeah?
Name?
Yeah.
I'm tellin' ya, I'm giving you all I know.
Maybe that's where I'm gonna cut your throat.
No, I go to a school to learn how to do hair. It's a government program. But really I want to be a model - and I am definitely not sellin'.
Hey, don't you think a hair stylists got any interest in gettin' it on?
You just quit bein' a priest or somethin'?
Hello, again.
You and the other one, you're still Billy's girls. You always were his girls...
You're gonna help us take him.
After I get outta this, cop...I'm gonna live forever...
You got a name, cop?
You're crazy.
What's the big deal about you bein' on the street?
If we come outta this joint with Ganz' phone number, or a dead Indian, or anything else useful, then you could turn the other way for half an hour while I get laid...
You tell me what Ganz busted out for, he's after a lot more than just gettin' out of jail.  And whatever it is, you're part of it.
That wasn't necessary, buddy. I got this under control.
This sucks.  A maniac gets hold of my gun and goes all over the streets killing people with it. So, instead of me being where I oughta be, which is in bed giving my girl the high, hard one, I'm out here doing this shit, roaming around with some overdressed, charcoal-colored loser like you.
Yeah, right.  You want to try again?
Just tell me about the money.
Right, partner.
This'll show you how smart I am. I got it parked.
What?
You'd think the guy'd be smart enough to know he was being tailed.
I suppose you'd never be like Luther and let a woman get to you...
Say, do you always work people over like you did Luther?
You know, I'd be embarrassed if I let my wheels go the way you've done with this job.
We missed.
Maybe we should pay Luther a visit.
I don't know why, but I'm going to let you keep it. Maybe because you told me you had it, or maybe just because I'm too tired to argue...
Thanks for callin' in... and I guess Maybe... Look, I'm sorry I called you Watermellon nigger... those kinds of things. I was just leanin' on ya, doin' my job.
Hey, how'd my car get here?
Yeah, well the only woman of the Indian's we ran into was shacked up with her dyke girlfriend.  I guess she went with him before she came outta the Closet ... They both looked mad enough to kill him...
You okay?
Wait a minute, Cates.  I've been waitin' three years for that.  I don't think it's fair, man. What about the merit system.? You were gonnna give me a few thousand.
Thanks.
This guy must have had a .44 like yours, Jack. Now he's got yours.
I think I wanna have a discussion about it with any of the ones still walking.  Can we find them?
You look awful.
Long night, too, from what I heard ... Word's going around that in addition to losing Ganz for the second time, and in addition to Haden busting you back to Patrolman, some jig beat the crap out of you.
I don't think your gun's loaded...
A guy in the bar called me a dumb bitch today.
Then I sit back and I think, I mean, who's to say I'm not a dumb bitch.  I work in a bar, right? I can't read a list of my academic credentials to every booze-hound that comes in the place... You are what you do...
When you start with that attitude... it's like I don't know who you are.
Call me later.
Listen, Goddamn it if you think I'm happy about it, you're nuts. I just gotta take care of a few things, okay?
Elaine, I gotta put you on hold...
Hello.
Hey, I don't believe it.
What makes you think they were lesbians, or as you so quaintly put it, dykes?
How'd they take it back at headquarters?
Hey, two days with him is enough.
How ya doin'?
Instead of worryin' about Reggie, you better worry about me...
When?
Let her go.
How much?
The case..with the stones... Where is it?
She's not my bride, she's my fare. She's looking for this Vito Cornelius. According to the phone guide he lives here.
We're not going on vacation..we're on a mission..
Of course.
Leeloo's in trouble?
Don't tell me you don't know how all this works?
There's no light! You told me there were supposed to be four beams of light.
It's a miracle!!!
Father, will you please explain what's going on?
Uh father, I know she's been through a lot... but the sacred stones..we don't have much time..
You're all safe. Thanks be to God!
She was taught to love the life of others... but not her own. You have to teach her to love if you want her to truly live!
I'm sorry, but... the Stones...
Yeah?
I love you too Major, but you haven't called me that since basic training.
At least, the cat comes back.
Finger!  I'm driving a cab now, not a space fighter!!
Uh... at least fifty.
Uh huh..and I don't suppose you got the name of this..perfect fare..
Daya deo dono Dato.  Dalutan!
Will the elements be gone now forever from this place?
You just won a trip, you dolt! Ten days in Fhloston Paradise for two!
Major Dallas, if our calculations are correct you still have 57 hours owed to the Federal Army on your enlistment which is more than you will need for a mission of the utmost importance.
You couldn't come up with something a little more discreet?
I'm not going.
Valo massa... Chacha hamas.
Apipoulai!
Finished what?
You learned 900 languages in five minutes?!
You get that off the screen?
It's up to you now, Angel!
...Like love...
How someone strong like you scared from a message? Is good news I sure!
Have you identified it?
I have to address the Supreme Council in 10 minutes. Just the facts, General.
Not yet Sir..The only thing we know is it just keeps getting bigger!
...Not far, now.
How's our deal coming along?
The Stones will be here. I'll see to it personally!
You better not be smoking, that's all I can say.
This is the mortgage.  This is Cindy's college money.
Sometimes you can't know what I'm doing.  It's better that way.
Why haven't you called?  Why don't you answer your phone?
You couldn't?
You're killing me...
Who are you calling?
What?
She died in her sleep three days ago.  It was in the paper...
It's an honor to meet you.  Thank you for seeing us.
Five thousand now, five thousand on delivery. Two women, one white and one black, as long as they have large breasts. Hard bondage, or course.  Other than that, trusting your artistic interpretation, I have only two stipulations.
Excellent.
Mister Welles... would you be so kind as to remove any firearms from your person?
Empty the gun onto the table, very carefully.
Is that him?
... sorry...
What can I do for you, Mr. Welles?
Few days ago, I was contacted by a couple living in Philadelphia, a doctor and his wife.  What happened was they picked up a young girl hitchhiking off 81, which heads into Philadelphia, started up a conversation with this girl, she looked homeless, seemed about eighteen maybe.  They convinced her to let them buy her a meal in the city.  Nice kid, mature, didn't have much to say, but they got a sense she's a runaway, so all through dinner the doctor's working on her, trying to convince her that at the very least she should pick up a telephone.  Not surprisingly, she ate her food, excused herself...  That's the last they saw her.  The reason they came to me for help, the reason I'm coming to you, is we had a friend of mine in the department work up a sketch...  They want to see if I can I.D. this girl, somehow pass along a message to let the parents know the kid's alive, doing alright.
For whatever reasons I thought you might be more receptive.
They were pretty clear they didn't want this coming back on them.
Celebrity Films.
What's he talking about?
I'm gonna kill you.
Starting to recognize a pattern?
I don't know...  ... out there somewhere.
I never killed anyone.
As Mr. Christian's attorney and one of the executors of his estate, it concerns me that a meeting of this sort should take place without my being asked to attend.
Except, you're willing commit murder with them.
You're asking me why?
I'm not a cop.
... Hello... ?
You're telling me it doesn't get to you?
His stuff comes out of New York. Bondage and fetish videos, Gothic Hardcore.  Definitely not for the squeamish.
What's next?
Mister Welles. You're very prompt.
He's odd.
I've spoken to friends of mine and my husband's, in Harrisburg, in Lancaster and Hershey.  Asking about you.  I must say you have friends in influential places.
His passing has left me with... something of a dilemma.  A terrible, terrible dilemma.
Pittsburgh?
There was nothing he could do.  My husband left everything to me.  I prevented anyone from seeing the contents.  I felt these were my husband's private things.  I didn't... I didn't realize...
Please, believe me.  This is probably a stag film.  Simulated rape.  Hard to stomach, and it might seem real, but there are ways of making it look realistic... fake blood and special effects...
I deal in divorce cases.  Corporate investigations...
Hello... ?
Okay.
Hello?
Nothing more than a bother.  Have you any news for me?
It's very important you don't let this raise your expectations.  It's not going to effect any ongoing efforts.  All I'm saying is, please know, I'm not here to create any false hope.
So, she didn't leave a note?  She never gave any indication where she might go, before she left?
If there's anything you feel uncomfortable talking about, tell me, but I have to ask.  Your husband... he committed suicide?
September 4th, 1993.  About a year after Mary disappeared.
I remember.  You just left...
Mrs. Mathews, your daughter is dead. She's dead.
They killed her, and they took her out in the forest somewhere and they buried her...
I'm required by state law to inform you that, while it's perfectly legal for you to purchase these items, it is illegal for you to use them for any sort of...
You alright?
You in a hurry?
No...
Rick stayed later after school with Kristen.  She wasn't feeling very well.
I thought it was an accident.  Smoking in bed.
No offense, or anything, but it's kind of hard to swallow.
Here we are.
What the hell was that?
You look great!
Something the matter with the cuisine?
Something wrong with the stairs?
Now you know who and what Freddy really is.
Feeling better now?
Hey...wake up.
Mommy...?
About him?
You stopped it didn't you?  It was probably just a regular bad dream.
You disappointed in me?
Dan keeping you up again?  Put a lock on that window, girl.
It was no accident.  It was Krueger.  He used to get in through my dreams, but not anymore.  He's found some other way.
Oh, Alice...no.  Honey, I love you but you're going to have to get a hold of yourself...
All I know is that you are not doing yourself or the baby any good by acting like a crazy woman.  Why don't you take off - leave Springwood and cool out somewhere for a while?
Look...we're all tired.  None of us had any sleep since Friday night...
Are you alright?
But how are we gonna --
I've got to write some of this down.
Then get out!
Who's Jacob?
Where are you going?
They couldn't prove it.  No body!  Nuns bumping themselves off is bad for business.
Have another one, sounds like you need it.
Dan.  And he's taking Alice with him -- pretty good dive Yvonne.  You've been practicing.
Vomit?
Why don't you shut up and let her talk! Two of us died in the last two days, does that strike you as particularly normal?!
It's okay.
You, too?
My father!  He's not - ?
However our ideas disagree, as I've said before, I'm <u>not</u> a coward!  And it happens you've got no choice:  Either <u>I</u> take you down there, in the Lungfish, or you don't get there -
Maybe - just 'maybe' - when their ship doesn't return - they'll decide not to come here, after all.
So all of a sudden his only son drops out of school, be- gins making noises like a pacifist.  A real egghead, do-gooder, and crackpot!  'Ban the atom tests!  Junk the nuclear subs!  Spend the mili- tary budgetfor peace!'
But <u>they're</u> not Skipper Neilsen's son!  It broke his heart.  Then when some newspapers called Carl 'the honest, sincere son of a war-mongering father' - Captain Neilsen resigned from the Navy.  Oh, he still keeps his hand in - playing around with projects like the 'Lungfish' - but it broke him, all the same.
I think you're right.
I don't hear anything.  Maybe you've been down here too long.  Why don't you go back up and -
Excuse me, Skipper---
Now they feel it...down below.
Excuse me, Captain - there may be one last, desperate chance - a one-in-a-thousand shot...
Thought you were going to Washington, Skipper.
'Doctor' Neilsen?  When did <u>that</u> happen?
A hundred and eighty fathoms! We can't be sinking that fast....
Straight to the Pole - at almost fifty knots!
Remove your weapons, Commander. And come here - alone!
That's a <u>face</u>???
Swell!
It is a living thing.  When damaged - you would say 'wounded' - it immediately 'heals' itself.
See what?
You plotted the course of Cyclops?  Then that's <u>our</u> course!  Wherever <u>he</u> goes, <u>we</u> go.....until we get him!
Cyclops will have to linger at the Pole to recharge his power banks.
You got yourself a computer, Alma.
Always has been.
Who?
I know he's due for the last two years. I was thinking of paying it when the insurance comes in.
The good news is we haven't got to your car yet. The bad news --
Chub says you're fired.
I screwed up the divorce. I agreed with everything she said. I wanted her to like me. I just want to be a good father.
We bought you.
You might not kill it.
The only difference between me and that Clemens on TV is luck, shit luck.
You gotta be more careful about that shit. Gordon or one of those guys sees you smoking that wacky tabacky around me they'll expect me to bust you. And I'll be outta a job.
You bring him up yourself? That's a steep climb.
Open the door, will ya?
Those are the Hoyts.
Why do they do that?
You know.
But it's not funny now.
I bet you did lots of bad things.
What then?
Some party, huh? Sorry I lost sight of you. I had to step outside for a smoke. You find anybody you know here? There must be some kids you used to know from school. You want to go tomorrow? See your old teachers? Be more fun than hanging out with me all day.
Jesus. Listen, Jill, tell you what. Tomorrow morning, you still want to go home, I'll drive you down. I'll get off work or something.
That's illegal, you know.
You're a policeman.
Jill, please, it's alright. Nothing happened.
We're looking for the funniest costume! And the scariest! And the most imaginative! And the best costume of all!
Huh?
Fuck. You don't know how bad or anything?
I saw Mel Gordon in here this morning.
You? Why?
Want to buy?
She's grown up some, hasn't she?
Did you get his number?
You okay?
You okay?
Jack's sort of sensitive, I guess. More than most. But he'll be okay in a few weeks.
Everybody needs money. Except guys like Twombley and that sonofabitch son-in-law of his. People like that.
Lots of people. Guy like Evan Twombley, Boston union official, probably got lots of people want to see him dead. The Government's been investigating his links with the Mafia.
Did you tell them?  That we were coming?
Of course! I would've heard.
This is nuts.
Whitehouse. Next time, phone ahead.
Something about my father?
Take care, Wade.
The fucker shot himself. Ker-bang! That's what it sounds like. Not on purpose. I assume accidental.
Jillie, you want a cheese grilled sandwich?
Yeah.
Rolfe.
It'll come out Jack lied and the kid'll get hung for it.
No shit.
The night before the shooting.
Jill. I was thinking of getting a lawyer. Maybe you can help me.
Haven't you already done a bit of that?
Anyone else want one? Rolfe?
Which is?
Who'd pay him that kind of money? Not the mob. They got their own guys. Specialists.
So Mel Gordon wouldn't want a professional hit. That'd make the feds dig deeper. He wants an accident.
Hey Joey, how `bout a cocoa, double whip cream.
When I write my memoirs I think I'll devote an entire chapter to the cocoa aboard Air Force One.
Mom?
Pop it open. There should be a red switch, toggle it up.
Who's flying the fucking plane?
No. We're losing fuel and my rudder's not responding.
They've got no chutes. They can't control the plane, their engines are failing and they're losing fuel.
Sir, you threw out page two.
General Greely says it looks like the Middle East.
They still have the President, it's past their deadline and they haven't called. What do you think it means?
Why?
That's affirmative.
Remarkable aircraft. Remarkable.
Over the Black Sea. I can probably get us to Turkey or Georgia.
Tower, Air Force One has been boarded.
Romeo Tango Zulu, do you have the President? Over.
Ms.  Mitchell.  So nice to finally meet you in person.
Up on the upper deck is the cockpit and the Mission Communication Center. The MCC, as we call it, can place clear and secure phone calls to anywhere on earth.  We're linked to a network of military and civilian satellites and ground stations.  We could run the country or run a war from there if we had to.
What do you know of my husband?
My husband is a very courageous man.
Do you have to be so brutal?
This administration does not negotiate with terrorists.
We've already played our cards, Major. There's no turning back.
What are you doing?
The fax machines.
Someone should give you a raise.
and if that means negotiating...
*                     We could always put you in a duck blind with a twelve gauge.  The second amendment types'll love that.
I said it's not worth the fight.  Steward, please.
Defense and State Department in the conference room in one hour.  I want to review the Iraq situation.
Shepherd.
Iraq, sir. We're over Iraq.
I wonder how your boys in Washington are going to take this one.
What's the story?
Oveur.
Shut down accelerators.
Dunn.
Ted, what's wrong?
Let's relax tonight, just the two of us. I'll make a quiet Italian dinner just the way you like it, with spaghetti.
Elaine, what happened to us?
Elaine!
Elaine, I'm going back there.  Just hold onto that stick and try to control this hunk of tin as best you can.
Well, Elaine, this might be it if those guys on the ground don't think of something.
Simon just ejected!
What will happen to him, Ted?
Ted, the lever!
Ted seemed to get worse after I told him about Simon, Doctor.
Women <u>and</u> the space program have come a long way, sweetheart.  But after the wedding, no more complicated computers for my little girl.
Frank's the best pilot in the program.
Meet me onboard, sweetheart.  I have to pick up a few things at the drugstore.
Simon, I'm going to check ROK's secondary readout unit.
Can't we change course?
Can I say something of a personal nature to you?
Will Scraps be able to sit with us, Dad?
Do you think things will be a lot different on Mercury, Dad?
How many kids get a chance to live on another planet.
Can I hold him?
It's a privilege to meet you, sir, I'm familiar with all your work.
I have to see Bud Kruger.
You can't go in there!
Do you want to talk about it.
No.  I mean your relationship.
Then the relationship remains the same and the love changes only when there's change in the two people who share that love.
Well, it really wasn't a vacation. You see, I'm a teacher in the New York City school system, and I was attending a seminar on visual aids to education. Are you from L.A.?
I'm sure we'll both make it...but just in case one of us...well, is there a message you'd like me to give someone?
Hello, I'm Paul Carey from the airline. I'm here to pick up Captain Kramer.
Yeah, something like that, but as I say, they didn't have time to tell me very much.
Surely you can't be serious.
Elaine, I haven't time to put this gently, so I'll be very direct. Everyone of us on this plane is in a desperate situation. Mister Striker is the only hope we've got.
I won't deceive you, Mister Striker. We're running out of time.
Elaine, you're a member of this crew. Can you face some unpleasant facts?
I came home early and found your note. I guess you meant for me to read it later. Elaine, I've got to talk to you.
Is it? Because of my mistake six men didn't return from that raid.
I think they're getting the hang of it! When we re-enlist I'll teach them baseball!
It's a damn good thing he doesn't know how much I hate his guts.
Hey, we've been waiting for you. A little bit late tonight.
Oh, Bill, I'm going to miss you so much.
Good-bye, darling.
And get that finger out of your ear. You don't know where that finger's been! Gunderson?
Eight miles. Turn right to heading zero eight niner.
He's all over the place! Nine hundred feet up to thirteen hundred feet! What an asshole!
I'm an airline pilot.  Ah, Clarence, according to my calculations, with this tailwind we ought to be able to make up an additional fifteen minutes over the Rockies.
Denver Control, this is Flight two-zero- niner intersecting Victor Airway seven- niner-niner.
Would either of you like another cup of coffee?
Excuse me, sir. Would you like some coffee before we serve dinner?
Excuse me, sir. There's been a little problem in the cockpit and I was wondering...
Oooh.  Hardball.  That sounds interesting.  Are you going to strike me?  You could tie me up and then do whatever you want with me... I've got my own ropes.
I like my horizons narrow.
You don't have squat.
I'm Sergeant Sykes, and this is Detective Jetson, Los Angeles Police Department.
Terrific.  A real pillar of the community.  Was Hubley missing anything when they found him?  Was he ripped off?
Well... yes, quite possibly.
I believe I should interview the widow alone.
Your name wouldn't happen to be Porter, would it?
Matthew, you don't have to-- .
How could a straight-arrow like you ever pick a roommate like him?
It's all right, George.  It's cool. Just wait here, all right?  I'll be back in a coupla minutes.
The hell it isn't, when somebody wires up enough C-4 explosive to my car to turn me into pink mist!  That Slag was on something, and not sour milk, either?  Am I right?  TELL ME!  What is it?
We?  You've taken it?
George, uh... you're gonna break his little chest bones...
George, c'mon -- lighten up.  It's a beauty of a case.  Don't sweat it -- we got him by the short hairs. He ain't gonna make any more of the shit.
With Harcourt and Kipling dead, I assume you will be requesting reassignment now.
What's this about, George?  I know that look.
Harcourt is dead.
That where Anderson worked?
Jesus, are the questions too tough for you already?  Let's try again--  Is your name Porter?
You know I've been over all this with Fedorchuk and Alterez this morning...
No I.D. on him and -- well, you know, no fingerprints -- so it could be tough.  Your buddies this morning went through the mug book but couldn't make a facial match.
You took this gut out, too, didn't you?
Lucky for you, you got him in both of his... well, what we loosely refer to as... hearts.
What kind of test?
Watch the driver.  I'm going for a better angle on the door.
This floor's freezing.
I've isolated a neuro-muscular toxin responsible for the paralysis.  It seems to be metabolizing.  He should wake up soon.
You're saying one of those things lays all the eggs?
And it's too late to shut it down?
That the atmosphere processor?
This is clearly an important species we're dealing with here. We can't just arbitrarily exterminate them --
What rank?  I believe Corporal Hicks has authority here.
I expected more of you, Ripley. I thought you would be smarter than this.
These Colonial Marines are some tough hombres, and they're packing state-of-the-art firepower. Nothing they can't handle...right, Lieutenant?
We're talking thermonuclear explosion.
How may drops is this for you, Lieutenant?
Hold at forty.  Slow circle of the complex.
One of us?
So.
GET THEM OUT OF THERE!  DO IT NOW!
I told them to fall back...
How do you feel?
Yes, Hicks?
What's the question?
Are there any questions?  Hudson?
Outstanding.  Then all we need's a deck of cards.  All right, let's move like we got a purpose.
All right.  There's a fire door at this end.  The first thing we do is put a remote sentry in the tunnel and seal that door.
Now many?
You can't help them.  Right now they're being cocooned just like the others.
Thanks.
We need the other drop-ship.  The on one the Sulaco.  We have to bring it down on remote, somehow.
I don't care how!  Think of a way.  Think of something.
Just terrible?  That's better than yesterday at least.
Bad dreams again?  Do you want something to help you sleep?
Yeah, you know.  In the walls, under the floor.  I was the ace.  I could hide better than anybody.
Now you just lie here and have a nap.  You're exhausted.
Gone.
Don't go!  Please.
How many colonists?
A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish. Be my most tasty little dish! Be my most tasty little dish!
A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish.
Follow me, please. The Archbishop would like a word.
Well, I think that went off remarkably well, don't you?
What's that?
The marriage!
How was I? Tell me honestly.
No, she's fine.
Is she a good fuck?
Hardly.
Your son is an unprincipled, spoiled, conceited brat.
Why what, sir?
Humiliated?
Don Giovannnnnnnni!
What is it?
Your Grace, I've got something to tell you. I want to complain about this man.
That's stupid.
Yes, you are. You're very sick.
I think you're mad! You're really mad!
All they want to see is your work. What's wrong with that?
Yes!
My Stanzi - look at her! Isn't she beautiful? Come on now, confess, Papa. Could you want a prettier girl for a daughter?
Salzburg.  We were just talking about Salzburg.  If you've come from my friend the Fartsbishop, you've arrived at just the right moment. Because I've got good news for him. I'm done with Vienna. It's over, finished, done with! Done with! Done with!
What?
Half the house! You'll never see a penny. I want it here, in my hand.
Excellency!
How charming.  But why did he not come himself?
Then he didn't send you?
This is not his handwriting.
You're mad! She's mad, Wolfi.
He's adorable!
Behold!
I've heard about you for ages! I thought you must be an old man.
What a strange young man.
What a charming idea. May I see?
An interesting idea, Majesty. But -
You already commissioned an opera from Mozart.
I don't think you understand me, Court Composer.
Majesty!
Would you tell me why?
But it's new, it's entirely new. It's so new, people will go mad for it. For example, I have a scene in the second act - it starts as a duet, just a man and wife quarreling. Suddenly the wife's scheming little maid comes in unexpectedly - a very funny situation. Duet turns into trio. Then the husband's equally screaming valet comes in. Trio turns into quartet. Then a stupid old gardener - quartet becomes quintet, and so on.  On and on, sextet, septet, octet! How long do you think I can sustain that?
I write to you with urgent news. I am coming to Vienna. Take no further steps toward marriage until we meet. You are too gullible to see your own danger. As you honour the father who has devoted his entire life to yours, do as I bid, and await my coming.
Why are you here?
Don't worry, I'm not staying here to be a burden.
Ah-ha! Siena macaroons - my favourites. Give my best thanks to the baker.
Oh, yes, sir, all day long. He never leaves the house until evening. He just sits there, writing and writing. He doesn't even eat.
Where does he work?
Now calm yourself. Calm. What's the matter with you?
Where?
Opera? Opera!
That's right.
Well?
Isn't he marvelous? He cost me a bundle, that horse, but he's worth it. I tell you, if you'd played Don Giovanni here it would have been a great success. I'm not joking. These people aren't fools. You could do something marvelous for them.
No.
You won't be teaching this one either. She's my wife.
Herr Mozart. What a surprise. What can I do for you?
Well, your pupil is married and living in Mannheim, young man.
Well, could you lend me some money till you have one? Then I'll teach her for free. That's a promise. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm being silly. Papa's right - I should put a padlock on my mouth. Seriously, is there any chance you could manage a loan? Only for six months, eight at most. After that I'll be the richest man in Vienna. I'll pay you back double. Anything. Name your terms. I'm not joking. I'm working on something that's going to explode like a bomb all over Europe!
Really? Why?
With all my heart, Mozart.
Nine performances! Nine! That's all it's had - and withdrawn.
You mean she's not coming back?
I would never miss anything that you had written. You must know that.
Are you ill?
Yes.
Third measure, second beat starting on E.  Flam-mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis.  And fourth measure, fourth beat - D.  Ma-le-dic-tis, flam-mis a-cri-bus ad- dic-tis.  Do you have that?
It couldn't be simpler.
Oh? Have I seen it?
You mean in Turkey?
What are you doing, Herr Director?
Then why doesn't he simply appoint me to the post?
Mozart, music is not the issue here. No one doubts your talent. It is your judgment of literature that's in question. Even with the politics taken out, this thing would still remain a vulgar farce. Why waste your spirit on such rubbish?  Surely you can choose more elevated themes?
About what?
I do not seek forgiveness.
Where?
No? Was Mozart a good man?
No, you didn't!
Bravo, Your Majesty!
This is embarrassing, you know. You introduced Mozart to some of my friends and he's begging from practically all of them. It has to stop.
But he's all right?
Dr. Hirsch?
He doesn't remember. He woke up at the zoo.
Right. Now listen carefully. I want you to bring David here. I want him in my care. I'll notify the police that we've found him. It is imperative that you bring him straight to the hospital. Do you understand?
You're certain he's lucid? You won't need any help?
Shall I send a car?
It was a wolf.
Mr. Kessler?
You put me in an awkward position, Mr. Kessler.
Aw come on, Miss Price!
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked you.
How old are you?
Now, David, I said I would keep you company, but I meant right here and now.
How did we get from your bad dreams to my taking a holiday with a patient?
You're being awfully forward, aren't you?
My friend Jack was just here.
I was dreaming again?
Closet.
The bedroom.
It's nice to see you.
Hopeless. It's hopeless.
No what?
Feeling better?
The doctor will be round later. Would you like a picture book to look at? We have some lovely funny Beanos.
No what?
He all right?
I think he's a Jew.
Take these round now, will you please? The American boy in twenty-one is only to have these after he's eaten. Will you be sure of that?
Nothing quite as dramatic as that, Miss Price. He just doesn't eat enough of what is put before him. He suffers from nightmares. I'd think he just needs a hand to hold.
Officer, I killed those people last night.
Now see here young man.
Miss Price! Miss Price, please!
How long have I been here?
Lunatic?
There were witnesses?
How could there have been witnesses? It was so dark. We were running and I fell and Jack went to help me up and this thing came from nowhere... I don't understand what they're talking about.
You've never had bad dreams before?
Are you cold?
Well, anyway, do you think she'll be there?
Rendezvous in Rome starring Jack Goodman and Debbie Klein. The love affair that shocked Europe! See torrid lovemaking at its most explicit! See Jack and Debbie expose their lust in the sacred halls of the Vatican! Never has the screen dared...
What about it?
Ask them what the candles are for.
Listen, that's a pentangle, a five- pointed star. It's used in witchcraft. Lon Chaney, Jr. and Universal Studios maintain it's the mark of the wolf man.
Jack, we'd better go.
Beware the moon?
Shit! David, what is that?
Oh shit. What is that?
You really scared me, you shithead.
Thanks a lot.
Debbie Klein cried a lot.
Shut up, you zombie!
What's wrong with you? Shut up!
Remember what that guy at The Slaughtered Lamb said? 'Beware the moon.'
Jack, are you really dead?
What can I say, Jack?
You look awful.
I could hang myself.
Dr. Hirsch?
Excuse me.  Yes?
What's that?
Hot chocolate?
No, thank you.
Hello, Tom.
Where's Matt?
Say pal, did you ever hear of a Depression?
I remember once when your account checked.
I'm running this bank my way. Get that clear!
No. You can't reason with anyone else when you're in a jam. We pleaded with you to keep liquid, but you wouldn't listen to us. You preached to us about faith and a lot of other rubbish. Now you want our help. You want us to throw a lot of cash into a bank that you've wrecked. All right. There's one way you can get it. Give us an option on your stock and resign as president.
Say, you can't do that-
Come out here you pawnbrokers - take a look at this!
Thanks.
What happened?  You're not a thief. How'd you get mixed up with these kind of people?
What was my wife doing in your apartment last night?
She wasn't to blame, Mr. Dickson. It wasn't her fault. Honest, it wasn't. I begged her to come up. She didn't-
Then what did you want to gamble for? If you'd have beat us out of fifty G's, you'd have been paid, wouldn't you? Well, we want our dough.
Dude - there's not any chance of my becoming involved in this, is there?
For a celebrated bounder, that is an awful admission. Besides, I never knew that any female could do this to you .
Well, what?
What?
And now fair woman, I have you in my power.
That will be just about enough! Now get out of here!
Good morning, Mr. Dickson.
Shall we let the people come in?
Don't you forget that I'm still the head man around here too. Now we'll get the tickets changed for tomorrow night. You and I are going out together. How's that?
Listen, dear. I want to ask you something. I know it's a silly thing for me to ask you, but . . . I want you to tell me the truth. Where were you last night?
Why - well, I-
In Mr. Sampson's office.
Oh!
Yes?
Mr. Dickson?
What's the matter? You don't seem very excited about it.
No. I won't.
We haven't got much time left, Mr. Dickson. We've got to do something quick or it'll be too late.
You're not giving up, are you, Mr. Dickson?
Oh, I can explain about that later. You're losing your bank - don't you realize what that means?
Listen, Mr. Dickson, don't let them lick you just because a couple of big shots turned you down. You've got more friends than anybody in this town. Little guys - guys who wouldn't be in business if it weren't for you. All you've got to do is-
I want you both to take the day off. Go downtown and get a license and get married right away!
My wife? What's she got to do with you?
Why?
Hey, look out, somebody's likely to see us!
Well . . . ?
Did you talk to him?
-for the rheumatism, you know.
So you were home last night?
What time did you get in?
This is the best score yet.
Cole, we're outlaws. Not exactly the most respectable job, if you know what I mean.
Home. We go home. We ride like hell to get there, and we kill anything or anyone that comes between us and our homes. And when we get there we stay there and God help any fool who tries to get me to leave my farm again.
"The outlaws calling themselves the James-Younger Gang shot their way out of town, wounding the Sherriff and three other townsfolk."
Beg pardon?
Ride with me, cousin?
Where you boys going?
Thanks for the help.
The war? What, are you crazy?  There are things I miss about it.
Because we were good at it?  Hell, we were great at it. Jesse, don't tell anyone I said this, because everybody knows I'm the toughest man in this town, but you are one terrifying sonofabitch with those guns.
I'll pick the first job! I mean... I know a girl down at the bank. See if she can't get a list of towns where the railroad keeps its money.
All the posters and newspapers are calling this bunch the "James-Younger Gang."
Beautiful.
And almost got hanged in peacetime.
Missed you, cousin.
Where'd you get all these riders?
Some Indian tracker you turned out to be, Tom.
What the --
I have no idea what you just said, but it sounded real nice.
The safe. Now.
Great Chief of St. Louis send me.
I know it ain't no durned bank holiday!
Then why can't I go in there?
Web died fighting?
He thinks this is some kind of game!
So you're saying I could have done more to attract their attention.
That just might work.
You ready to stop loafing around with this young lady and get back to farming?
... We could move on. Rebuild. Make a decent life someplace else.
How'd it go in there?
And I planned getting you off the hangman's deck --
What do you want me to say, Frank? I was killing men when I was fifteen. I like getting shot at. I like riding out of town with a posse at my back. This is a helluva better life than farming.
Shoulda learned with Web. Made it look fun, made it look like an adventure. Got Web killed. Now Jim.
I'll meet you down there in a few weeks.
Ma, I'm glad to see you being nice to our Injun friend.
Ma! Please!
But still died.
Teasing you is completely unfair.
I am so sorry, Jesse.
Aw, shucks, ma'am...
Oh, it's a similar room. But the hotel is in Washington D.C. You're not going to get a fair trial down here, in front of a jury of Jesse James sympathizers.
You almost ended my career before it began.
Mmm.
Oh. That's nice to know.  We're going to hang you, you know.
I'd just as soon kill you, Jesse James. But chasing you takes up too much of my time.
Now let's have a drink.
You okay, Jesse?
Tell you something else.  I can't drink that good neither. I'm going to go outside and throw up.
Jesse, you explain to Lyla. My girl, you know, from that time...
Oh, you were talking to Jesse.
Really?
Not at all.
Well, this land is about to be condemned.
Really!
Parker, tell me what's going on so I can return as quickly as possible to Boston and my whores and cigars, not necessarily in that order.
Good.
Just perfect.
It's early in the game yet, Mr. Rains. Jesse James and I are just learning how each other moves, feeling out each other's patterns.
There are only four banks within that travel radius which they have not robbed.
Listen, you're dating Luis, he's in Arizona. You're fucking me, and we haven't made plans. What could you possibly be up to tonight?
Ummm . . yeah. Luis is calling me tonight. I need to be home for that.
Uh huh.
Dorsia's nice.
You like it there, don't you?
J&B. Straight.
Why?
See? Happy? You dumb bitch? Are you happy, you dumb bitch?
Do you want to come to my apartment or not?
Nothing like last time, promise.
Really?
Marzipan. Pink tents. Hundreds, thousands of roses. Photographers. Annie Leibovitz. We'll get Annie Leibovitz. And we'll hire someone to videotape. Patrick, we should do it.
Why don t you just go for Price?
He has a great body
I want a firm commitment.
You're really serious, aren't you?
But where?
Listen, what about dinner?
It was a pretty long message, wasn't it?
Carnes? Wait.
What are you talking about? Bateman is what?
What...is...it?
Van Patten looks puffy. Has he stopped working out?
Oh come on. Price. There are a lot more important problems than Sri Lanka to worry about. Sure our foreign policy is important, but there are more pressing problems at hand.
I said we are totally booked.
Ricky Hendricks has to cancel today. He didn't say what he was canceling or why.
Okay, Jean. I need reservations for three at Camols at twelve-thirty, and if not there, try Crayons. All right?
You don't like this, I take it?
Maybe. I don't know Not really. Bateman opens up a cupboard where there are a lot of very Bateman opens a cupboard where there are a lot of neatly ordered weapons - an ax, a rifle, a chain saw, duct tape, twine and a nail gun.
Welt...it depends, why?
Well, what about, oh, you know, maybe a Saturday?
What do you mean, she was a hot number.
Don't tell him you're here.
Did you know that guy who disappeared? Didn't he work at Pierce & Pierce, too? Was he a friend of yours?
Are you telling me you've never gotten it on with a girl?
Hi. I'm Donald KIMBALL
Pardon me, but are you okay?
So...there's nothing you can tell me about Paul Owen?
Where did Paul hang out?
So was I.
Well, I've had a hard time getting an actual verification. A Stephen Hughes says he saw him at a restaurant there, but I checked it out and what happened is, he mistook a Hubert Ainsworth for Paul, so...
I know it sounds like a lame question, but in New Jersey I know this sounds like a lame question, but last month-I don't know if you've heard about this, but a young stockbroker was recently arrested and charged with murdering a young Chicano girl and performing voodoo rituals with various body parts-
That's so typical, isn't it?
You'll have to excuse me. I have a lunch meeting with Cliff Huxtable at Four Seasons in twenty minutes.
I actually came to see Timothy Price, but he's taken a leave of absence.
And if you could try and pin down where you were the night of Owen's disappearance, it would make my job a lot easier.
Never. I mean...I don't really like... singers.
According to his date book, and this was verified by his secretary, he had dinner with...Marcus Halberstam.
He wasn't with Paul Owen.
I'm so hungry.
I know that, I know that. Jeez, you're like a broken record. I'm trying to help you.
Listen, do you think it's fair to take money from people who do have jobs? From people who do work?
Get a goddamn job, Al. You've got a negative attitude. That's what's stopping you. You've got to get your act together. I'll help you.
Shhhh...it's okay.
And how's Cecilia? She's a great girl.
Hey, I'm a child of divorce. Give me a break  Hmmm, I see they've omitted the pork loin with lime jello.
Paul, give me your Amex card. Good boy. Bateman slaps the card down, looks at the check.
No, man. I'm gonna bail.
You are a fanatic.
I'm just screwed.
It's important.
I forgot. That's why you have to help me decide.
When's Brian coming for the TV?
To our new life.  ...What's wrong?
He's your boss. He's not your --
They hack into people's programs?
It's almost nine, I've been so worried!  What did you see in there?
That was -- different.
Where were you?  You know you can't keep anything from me.
Why doesn't he ask us to his party. He's never even met you.
Great!
...What?
Mr. Barton, do you remember me?
Yes sir. I need to talk to you.
What seems to be the problem? You look a little upset.
My goodness.
If there's a Civil Rights violation. But generally we let the local police and DA do their work first.
Stigma? Larry! 60 billion buys you some slack in this world.
Milo? I'm Danny.
'Couldn't convince Teddy to come?
Cool!
You know a lot about art, I guess.
When you get to a certain age, you start wondering. About your legacy. I doubt you even remember Outpost 1.0 --
'Think I should buy some originals?
Could work with a new switch. There may be a few more things hidden.
Been thinking about the push mechanism in the handler. And it came over me: it's in the wrong place.
Gary, hi.
I'm okay. It's going well!
Cause he was a liar. And I hated him.  "Get your head out of that machine, wise up to the real world." The more he mocked me the deeper I went. Cause if being savvy meant being like him --  Guess that's why I'm kind of clueless, even now. Didn't cultivate my conniving side. 'Not sure I even have one.
I hope you know what you mean to me. Not just because of what you're doing. Because of who you are.
What'd the girl say?
Ready for number three?
I think you should go.
I know you lost all his work. Maybe I could come down here and --
Just thought his work should go on.
It's only meaningful when you've got 40,000 lines of code to back it up.
You calling Phil and Randy?
Now what are we doing? I don't get any of this shit!
You know mine.
Did I say something?
Did you wanna be alone?
He's out of prison?
We could cross-reference a data base on media ownership. But not on our own computers. Not even at home.
You'd have to design a graphic interface to make the data pop. Maybe some audio, too. To tie it all in to Gary. How long would that take you?
Oh, man. I'd have to get into Gary's house. To get the satellite positions.
Thank God.
Hardly anybody does, that's the beauty part. No cameras, the DOJ doesn't bother with it, it's accessed by a tunnel they boast about. You know the best place to hide a leaf?
Does he know you know?
...He knows.
They're in the neighborhood. They usually hassle Vietnamese grocers.
Every geek here's got a thing for Lisa. But that's about the biggest reaction she's had to anybody.
What is it?
There's nothing in this hall. Someone's pulling your chain, as usual.
You seem surprised to see me.

Austin Powers? Hi, I'm Andy Warhol.
Thank you.
Yes, I'm having trouble controlling...  THE VOLUME OF MY VOICE!
Yes?
Excuse me?
Maybe these photographs are the last piece of that puzzle.  I've uncovered the details on Project Vulcan. It's a new subterranean warhead delivery system.
I'm sorry, Basil, I thought she was a man.
All right, Austin, I think you should go.
Yes, I am programmed to answer any question.
Dr. Evil, do you really expect them to pay?
I've got you, Dr. Evil!
That's why right now is a very groovy time, man. We still have freedom, but we also have responsibility.
It seems the tables have turned again, Dr. Evil.
My meat and two veg.
Let me guess. The floss is garotte wire, the toothpaste contains plastic explosives, and the toothbrush is the detonation device.
Unfortunately, while you told that stupid story, Dr. Evil has escaped.
Not in the Nineties.
Hello, luv.
Thank God, Austin, we made it.
It's a shame he wasn't more headstrong.
It's not what it looks like, Vanessa.  At ease, boys.
I can explain. They attacked me. Gas came out of her...well, and then they... and I...
Follow me! We're going to have to jump over the rail!
I love you, Austin.

Austin Powers is getting too close. He must be neutralized. Any suggestions?
Release the sharks!  All the sharks have had laser beams attached to their heads. I figure every creature deserves a warm meal.
Hi.
But Scott, who's going to take over the world when I die?
An evil vet?
Scott my boy, come here. How was your day?
Scott, I want you to meet Daddy's nemesis, Austin Powers.
Um, Dr. Evil, Prince Charles did have an affair. He admitted it, and they are now divorced, actually.
I just don't see it.
Did you ever...
Did you ever want to?
What do you want to do, Scott?
The technology is brand new. Soon it will be more powerful. We anticipate a huge demand. Leave us your number. We'll be in touch.
Secret ...
Would that I could say the Same.
I've come to apply for membership in Brolly --
I'm afraid that's impossible.
You are female?
This is an official matter, Mrs. Peel. No need to take it personally. Where are you going?
Ahem. As I was saying, perhaps another macaroon ...
Good luck ... Peter ... Emma.
You.
An unholy trinity ...
Right, bridesmaid. Now what have I left out? Oh, yes, I know: the ring.
The result would be ...
Then what's stopping you?
Red herring would have been too obvious, don't you think?
... Showers followed by sunny periods.
But why? What's the point?
Sir August Merryweather ... why are we seeing him first?
I wasn't about to.
Elementary, Mrs. Peel. Trubshaw isn't the only shoemaker still practicing his trade ...
Well, he was a fellow of the Royal Zoological Society ...
That's what we were working on.
What, Lady Disdain? Are you yet breathing?
This must be the last straw.
Was I?
You followed me.
Because you always obey orders ...
Mmm ... what are you doing?
Mrs. Peel?
Ah ... sun tan lotion. Any shops nearby?
Do you also know that during your final experiment, your halfbrother- in-law was under surveillance?
Privately owned by ...
We know one thing. That suspect was not Mrs. Peel.
I was hoping you could tell me.
John Steed.
Rules are made to be broken.
I'm glad you guys came by... What's the occasion?
Man, you're losing your audience.
You sure Gary's got this whole party deal together?
I hope so. Hundred bucks apiece is a lot of dinero.
Thanks, Dad.  Cole, go away.
I don't want any trouble.
I mean it. The car is yours. Dump Debbie.
Shit, shit, shit, shit. My car's gone!
Yes, son, did you find out where the bachelor party is?
Thanks for the advise, sir.
Right.  Hey, shut up. Okay, sir.
Take hold of yourself. What room are they in?
Cole?
Cole, listen to me... I've got to tell you...
You know how that makes me feel, Deb? Wanta know how that makes me feel?  Angry, Deb.  Yesss, that's the word, angry. But if he makes you happy, you go right ahead. I want you to be happy, Deb.  No matter what, no matter how angry it makes me, no matter how much it hurts. Be happy, Deb. Be oh, so very, very happy.
God, you're a slob.
Don't worry... it's supposed to do this.
Of course. I'm a traditional guy... It's a traditional event.  Well, what do you think?
I don't know... I just feel scared.
That feels so great.
Let go of me!
I don't believe you.
See? And these are not just ordinary party-goers -- there are professionals in this crowd -- I didn't want any of them. You... You're what I want. Understand?
Are you okay?
Let's go.
I'm using the same caterer for the shower I had for our Christmas party last year.
What kind of job? I'm a housewife.
Great bathing suit.
So we want your best girls, the cream of your crop.
Jumbo, where the hell are the women?
That's it, prick lips.
I've had it, numb nuts... How much money you got?
Give him the works.
Screw you... Screw that... Don't jerk me around. You promised me 1500 seats for the Police Concert... 1500, not fifteen!... Screw that... Screw you -- Screw Sting.  Hi, guys.
Sounds swell... I'm really touched. And my getting married's not gonna change a thing between me and my pals. We're still gonna go bowling on Tuesdays, play cards on Fridays and wear women's clothes on Sunday night. I love you guys... I always will.
Guy paints a beautiful picture.
Looks like the only one who got screwed here was you.
Hookers beat you up?
Gary, how we doing, big stallion?
I'm telling you I am, Joe.
You are being in luck. Customers in same hotel. I let you have them at cut-rate price for 45 minutes.
Not one minute longer or Milt will come for you.
You want to share it?
What the hell are you doing?
Well, this is terrific. Now you're gonna have wrists that are smooth and kissable. Just go out there. Forget about everything and laugh it up.
You're all under arrest. Open up!
Well, I have to admit my game's a little rusty, but I love polo. It's unrelenting, a constant challenge to the senses. Really a beautiful experience.
I'd love that.
Feel free.
Welcome, welcome, one and all.
The end.
The thought of that person marrying my daughter makes me want to upchuck.
You've been having strange sex...!
Mrs.?
I'm getting one heck of a glare off your dress there. Could you undo a few buttons?
Where'd she go?
I think you'll enjoy this table.
Right in there, pal.
Now, don't get into any trouble.
Reach out and snort someone.
Thanks a lot, that was the best. You're next.
You're late again, Rick.
Can you believe how perfect it fits?
That's Franny. She likes firemen.
Goddamn it, Stephen, lay off!  You stupid dumbshit, you never know when to fucking quit, do you? You ever wonder why your career's in the fucking toilet? Why you're gonna be stuck a Lt. for life?
-- What the hell's the matter with you? You always check the other side. I haven't got time for bullshit right now, okay? We got a job here.
-- Knock it off!
Ah, everybody screws up some, Brian. You're working for the toughest Lt. on the job. Saw him once pick up a probie he thought was moving too slow and throw him into a burning building. It's just bad luck you're family.
Is he...
-- He killed people --
-- Stephen, this is bullshit --
I know you cold, Brian. The scary thing is, you probably could have faked it for awhile. But you see, in this job there's no place to hide. Isn't like selling log cabins. You have a bad day here -- someone dies. And that's not fucking good enough. Want another beer?
There's only so much technology can do.  Thanks for the beer.
C'mon ladies, let's roll some hose...
So you got a 'roid going with Jackson or what?
Look, Brian, a photographer. Maybe I can get on the cover of LIFE magazine, too.
Ready?
I had that fire. He didn't listen!
Well, long as you're here you can help clean up a little. I've got a guy coming to look at this in a few minutes.
Yeah, it's just another memory in my life right now. And I got way too many of them...
I saw it.
When dad died, I saw another fire...
Oh God, Stephen, what's going on with you?
Anything else?
I'll handle it.
What was that? Oh man, you have picked up a few moves since John Paul II Boulevard.
Boss and I are up to about three words an hour.
You think that's really any of your business?
Thanks for the invite.
This is one of the oldest fire stations in the city. Lotta tradition locked up in here. What do you think?
Well, our specimen here is your basic standard issue piece of primary suppression equipment. This area is the pumping panel, which controls the rate of liquid insertion into the hose.
Brian. What's wrong?
Let me ask you something, do you really think Marty had you assigned to arson because of your firefighting skills? Who the hell are you kidding? I was there, remember? I saw you and your brother --
Famous story even. Straight burn. Just an engine and truck first on scene. What did you feel, Brian, when you first got there?
If it was a joke, sir, you'd be laughing.
If you remember, sir, my test scores were in the top --
I need another one, sir.
Uh, I'm Brian McCaffrey. Your new assistant.
So you were happy here. Warm and cozy and in no hurry...  Soot high, clean unburned wall low, indicates slow burn in thermal balance.  Find me some glass.
Read.
Even if it was used to seal the air off, that doesn't explain why someone would go to the trouble of a backdraft. A gun's a helluva lot easier
Nice bunch of guys.
Then who wrote the report?
So what do you want me to do?
'Bout written you off. How long have you been in town?
Well that's two things to strangle Stephen for. Where is he, anyway?
Every little boy's fantasy.
Completely out of control.
Who's going to die?
They're waitin' man.
Sorry I hit Jackson.
Yeah? When was the last time?
I'm sorry... I... couldn't sleep...
-- Burn them.
When are you going to catch the prick that's doing this, Don?
Don't you have any leads at all?
Mr. Swayzak! How ya doin'?
It's horrible. They burned her breasts with cigarettes. Christ.
C'mere. You got some good blow, right?
First I'll put your Uptown in the spoon, then, to make it more exciting, I'm gonna add some Downtown. They call this thing a speedball, honey, but then you must know that...  First time shooting up?
That stuff'll kill you quick, man.
I forgive you.
I forgive you.
I forgive you.
Oh God, my God. it's goddamn good to be good. Forgive me. Father, for I have sinned. It's still goddamn good to be good.
It's still my money. If you want to have a chance at any part of it, shithead, you will take my $120,000 and bet on tomorrow's game.
Fuck yesterday's game. The World Series is seven games not six. Put in my bet.
OK asshole. You owe thirty grand. Now what are you gonna do?
The fucking rapists, man. The punks who raped that nun. The $50,000 reward from the Church! Remember?
-- that there was never any other way it could have gone.  Never any other way. So you had better just put in my fucking bet. $120,000 on the last game. The Big One. Come on! Are you a bookmaker, or fucking what?
Father, if it was so trivial, so natural, so -- No. I have sinned. And you must listen if you are to prescribe an appropriate act of contrition, and to absolve me. Father, what would you do if you had but one day in which to use your arms to serve God?
He gots to be did.
Everybody say Ho!
My name is Honeycutt and I want to try something different.  Can you do this for me?
Let's go niggers!
You idiot.  You almost gave me a massive coronary.
If you were really down you would get us together with that boss of yours.  What's his name again?
Yeah, him.
We're ready when you are.
What do you do?
Life is beginning to look up.  It's all good in da neighborhood.
Certified ladies' man, huh?
Why they gotta make my nose so big?
De-la-croix.
No offense.
Chill, I'm the brains behind this outfit.
We ran out without my shoes and the floor.  I gotta get my stuff.  What about our savings?
We got evicted from our home. We've both been on the streets for the last week.
If it's not too much trouble could you order us some food?
I would like to change your name.
You're now Mantan.
I want you to start using the name Mantan and not Manray if you don't mind.
Mantan?
I'm not playin' myself no mo'.
No matter how sexist or racist the material may be?
Are you trying to excuse our Holocaust?
...exactly thirty-two minutes ago.
Do you know how much information can be dispensed in one minute alone?
The middle class black family moves into a white suburban enclave.  The middle class black family moves into a small Southern town that is run by the KKK.  The middle class single black father raises his teenage daughter.  The middle class single black father raises his teenage daughter.  The middle class single black mother raises her teenage son.  And so on and so forth.  It's too clean, too antiseptic...
Delacroix, wake up, brother man. The reason why they didn't get picked up was because nobody - and I mean NOBODY - niggers and crackers alike wants to see that junk.
The name of the show?
That's a great handle.
Negroes would be in an uproar.
That'swhatI'mtalkin''bout. That'swhatI'mtalkin''bout!  He's off the hiz-hook!
I was hoping to perhaps direct some episodes myself, if not the pilot soon after.
Besides, what does he know about Negroes?
I don't give a good goddamn about Finland, Norway, Sweden or wherever ya blond ass came from.
Funnier to who and at who's expense? Dunwitty, when Negroes start to run amok, the boycotts, when the demostrations commence, I'm giving them your home address.  Let's see how you like it when they picket your lawn in Greenwich, Connecticut.
What do you want?
Go away, unless you got my money.
Pull up a chair.  Oh, excuse me, this is my lady DOT.
Good woman.  I trained her right.
The truth is never let them seeya sweat.  You do that, that's half the battle.
Three nights Charleston, South Carolina.
Sounds risky to me.
Hello.
Your life will never be the same.
I want to apologize about my brother and the Mau-Mau's.  I should not have imposed them on you.
What would their reaction be?  I hadn't the foggiest.
Thanks.
That crazy brother of yours doesn't think so.
This is nothing.  It will blow over by tomorrow.
No joke.  Serious.
You getting scared because some people don't like what you are doing?
You shouldn't even be mad at me over Sloan.
Richmond is not all the way down south.
Regardless, he still is your father.
You know how your Daddy is.
Finland.
Let Myrna finish.
Yes you!
No, we're not knocking boots.  I got this internship while I still was at NYU, DeLa was impressed with my get up and go and hired me to be his assistant.
Before we begin, I want to thank you for coming on my show for your first television interview.  You could have chosen Mike Wallace, Barbara Walters, Jane Pauley, whatnot but you're here.
Money and nothing else?
Too bad.  How 'bout a dress?
I heard ya lady is wild.
Oh, because on our first date, she let me...
Sleep 'N Eat, what's the matter with you?  Using all dose ten dollar words?
Y'know, at the beginnin' of the century, African-American had to perform in blackface.  You ever heard of Bert Williams?  He was a great artist.
Oh, you gonna make me say it.
Hoity-toity!  John Best, what's the matter here?
Has he sent the challenge yet?
You say he drives after breakfast and before dinner.  When he comes out to his carriage a couple of gendarmes will mount the box, and the coachman will get his orders to move on.
Not against Castle Dugan gate, that has been off the hinges these ten years.
Grogan gave me a wink of recognition, but offered no public token of acquaintance and it was not until two days afterwards that he called me into his quarters, and then, shaking hands with me cordially, gave me news which I wanted, of my family.
I suppose she addressed them to me in my real name, by which I never thought to ask for them at the post office.
I see you are thinking of a certain young lady at Duganstown.
Chevalier, if you will have your money now, you must fight for it. If you will be patient, maybe I will pay you something another time.
Ten thousand?  But the scoundrel owes me seventy thousand.
It is distasteful to kill a scoundrel -- that should be work for a hangman.
The amusing thing is that you deceive me without knowing, if it is true that you love me.
And if she does not choose to show you some kindness?
Suppose, now, Roderick, you, who are such a hero, was passing over the bridge and the enemy on the other side.
Was he cheated?
That fool didn't know what was the meaning of a hundred-pound bill, which was in the pocket-book that the fellow took from me.
Considering your financial circumstances, Mr. Cosgrove, it has been impossible to find anyone at all prepared to do any business with you.  I think you may count yourself lucky to have this opportunity. But, obviously, if you would reject this offer, I shall keep trying to find a better one.
Your bother is in America fighting the rebels.
Sir, let those laugh that win.
Yes.  He brought me in his carriage, and he will call for me at midnight.
Can I at least have a drink?
What about you, wandering around alone? At least we have an alibi --
You too?
You smoke, Ray?
Hey, Ray! Just had a nice talk with your buddy Kendall -- seems you killed three people!
I guess Nunez wasn't dead after all. He came after us with a vengeance.  You know the rest.
What about the phosphorous grenade?
Is that what I did, now? And of course, you can prove all of it.
You know how to work a pistol, Dunbar?
Shut up.  Let me see your grenades.
Jesus, what happened?
Whose blood is that, Jay?
Maybe, but that don't make me a killer --
You hated West, Mueller loved him --
Combat grade morphine. Mueller sold it to me.
That still doesn't mean you didn't kill him.
Full clip to the body --
I... I don't know...
There's no time to think, Ray, we gotta get out of here! You untie me, we grab the guns, get Kendall and Nunez, and make a run for it --
You... I've seen you around the Base. But you...  You're not Army, are you?
What happened to "degrees"?
Epileptic attacks are murder on your system. Rattle your internal organs like a paint mixer.
Why did you tell us he shot everybody, Levi? You put him in for three murders, the man saved your life --
I believe your next line is "What are you trying to hide?"
Jail if he's lucky, the gas chamber if he's not --
You lied to us, Levi, you're going to the gas chamber unless you tell us where to find them!
No, the problem is one's dead, one's got a bullet in his arm, and one won't talk. The one who won't talk was trading live fire with the dead one as we reached the pick-up.
Habeas Corpus -- you have to have a body to have a crime.
Nevertheless --
You think you could explain all this to me?
They're taking your command, aren't they?
If you let him testify then it would have all come out. West was supposed to take care of it out there, shut Nunez up and then disappear. But it got messy and people got killed. So you called your old pal Tom Hardy, figuring if worse came to worse, he'd cover for you.
What I can't understand is why you signed these. If you'd just let West take care of the paperwork, no one would have known, but you got careless. So when Pike finally told the truth you had to get rid of him, too.
Toxicology report came back. Kendall's attack was caused by a drug known as anephadrine, maybe you've heard of it. It's for asthmatics. If an epileptic takes enough, it kills them. I checked with the nurses at the hospital -- you're the only other person who visited Kendall.
I didn't mean that as a compliment.
Gotta be honest, I love what you've done with the place --
He got me through Basic and a lot of other stuff. I owe him.
Levi? Who names their kid Levi --
The Colonel saw you shoot Nunez, you're a murderer --
We're in the middle of a murder case --
Typical army brat story. Dad was noncom, Mom was a Nurse. There was never any real doubt of joining up.
This is the straight hitting on me you were talking about, isn't it?
That was kid gloves?
"Too neat." How long have you been an investigator?
Why the fuck wasn't he in restraints?
Styles couldn't reassign him, he's a legend --
Goddammit, Hardy, you can't just leave --
Why do you care?
So it's a good plan but it goes wrong; Mueller flips out and shoots their fall guy, which means they have to bring Dunbar and Kendall into the cover story --
Little bit.
Why don't you talk to Levi off the record for a second?
No, I didn't. I wanted to humiliate him. For what he did to Dunbar. For fucking over the little guy.
No.
You're a good man, Hardy.
West?
How?
We should tell him we're not going.
He couldn't kick you out so he wanted you to quit on your own.
Pike never confessed.
It won't work --
Hurricane's due after midnight and we're still going out?
Funny. I swear I saw them bring him and the smaller guy in this morning.
You think he did it?
What do you think?
You want Kendall, don't you?
You motherfuckers have just made the worst mistake of your lives! You have chosen to join my Army! This Army is my mother, my father, and my little virgin sister and I will not allow anyone or anything that is not up to my standards near her pretty little virgin cooze, do you understand me -- give me a sir, yes, sir!
Those who I deem unworthy to pass through this camp will quit, and those who refuse to quit I will kill. You ever hear of a training accident -- give me a sir, yes, sir!
Bloom like a flower?
You were expecting me?
Now tell me if that isn't the best pie you ever ate.
Fine, you do it.
How long have you known my father?
Not that one. The real story. Did he ever tell you that?
Did you see that woman?
And from the moment I saw her until the moment I die, she's the only one.
Really.
Means when you dream about something that's going to happen.  Like one night, I had a dream where this crow came and told me, "Your Aunt is going to die." I was so scared I woke up my parents. They told me it was just a dream, to go back to bed. But the next morning, my Aunt Stacy was dead.
You don't need a picture. Just look up handsome in the dictionary.
That's because we didn't have a wedding. Your mother-in-law was never supposed to marry me. She was engaged to somebody else.
I thought you said you didn't have a church wedding.
Okay.
You know anyone's who's taken it?
You can see my predicament. My wedding ring, the symbol of fidelity to my wife, soon to be the mother of my child, was now lost in the gut of an uncatchable fish.
People needn't worry so much. It's not my time yet. This isn't how I go.
Truly. I saw it in The Eye.
She was a witch.
You owe me three-fifty.
I thought you weren't dying.
But the real story is how I got the car. You see...
Do you know much about icebergs, Dad?
I'm trying to make a metaphor here.
The thing about icebergs is you only see 10 percent of them. The other 90 percent is below the water where you can't see it. And that's what it is with you Dad. I'm only seeing this little bit that sticks above the water.
Daffodils?
I can't imagine any place better than here.
I don't believe it!
So what are you up to now?
Can I ask you a question? Why did you come here today? If you found this deed, why didn't you just ask Eddie?
I'm going to get started on dishes.
Mmm.
You have to understand. When I was growing up, he was gone more than he was here. And I started thinking -- maybe he has a second life somewhere else. With another house, another family. He leaves us, he goes to them. Or maybe there is no family. Maybe he never wanted a family. But whatever it is, maybe he likes that second life better. And the reason he tells all those stories is because he can't stand this boring place.
Look, I know why you like him. I know why everyone likes him. But I need you to tell me I'm not crazy.
How did you get here?
What I mean is, do you really know what's going on in his head?
Would you say you understand Josephine?
Is he awake?
Yeah it was okay.
What?
A baby? What are we supposed to do with a baby?
To customers approaching the bank from the rear
Hello.
You must find some glasses, small, for the toast, and some plates.
So hang on. You're both Nadia's cousins?
So?
She says 'Hello' to you. Go for it John!
What was that?
Tell me what he said.
How is bank?
Put the fucking kettle down.
What did he say? Tell me!
Oh Jesus.
Just leave her alone.
Today is bath day.
I don't understand.
Unless. Unless this is part of the routine. You get tied up, stick around, distract me, they both bust in and Steal My Cup Of Coffee.
I don't want to know.
Why else would you send off for me? If you just wanted sex just go to a prostitute.
I'm going to be sick. Where's the...
I'm going... I am... I'm going to be sick.
You don't have to do this. I can look after myself.
What?
So uh...
Yeah. I tend to tie up and abandon women I really want to see again too.
Shut up. I'm not listening.
No.
And who says what is wrong.
Sometimes which?
I think it's my safest bet, don't you?
Do you know if it's a boy or a girl?
Are you scared?
What?
She's alive!! She is not dead?
Nobody's that unhappy.
I've got an hour. Can I buy you a coffee?
Yeah. No thanks.
Okay. Goodbye.
Whatever.
You have excellent English.
I'm standing most of my day. They're for support.  Didn't see you in church this mornin'.
I need to uh...
My little niece... she got this deep cough.
Thank you.  Oh. My wife. She had a card here for her migraine pills. She ain't gonna be around no more... So if you...
Hey.
What do you need?
Folks can dance when they want. Didn't buy that mirror ball for nothin'.
Hi.
You ain't the kicker, are you?
And, sir... do you have a size in mind for what you're lookin' for?
What happened?
I don't know. She's gettin' crazy, like she gets. Begged me not to go. Got real down. I just think somethin's happened. Like she run off with someone. You'd tell me if you knew somethin', right?
With all she was doin'. With all the shit she kept doing! You stayed stuck to that bitch's ass and you wouldn't let go.
It's not like I can't go out and have fun with my friends.
Thought you had a skirt earlier.
Why should you waste your life waitin' and wonderin'. Not like you're married.
You wanna go home?
I keep the heat on.
YOU SHUT UP!
Or what? OR WHAT?
Where's Ronnie?
I don't got any money... for fixin' me up and all.
I give ya enough chain so's you can get about the house. Get you to the kitchen. You need the bathroom, it'll reach.
Now you get up! And you get in my house!
Stop it! Stop it! IT HURTS!
No, ma'am. You stop that foolishness.
Means ya healin'.  So all this farmin' make me think on Matthew. Matthew 13. The parable of the sower? Man toss seed on rock, on the wayside, some fell in thorns... you know the story?
If all you got is filth comin' out'cha mouth... people just gonna tune ya out.  Rae. RAE! I'm not fightin' with ya. I just know you got more in you than junk.  Now, you sayin' you don't know how to cook anything at all?  You know how to boil water?
Want another?
Still makin' jokes?
I seen a man die. He couldn't breathe... his heart was... was givin' out.
You need some weed?
That ain't up to me to hook you up. Naw what I mean? She her own, you know?
How a girl get like that?
You ain't gonna make a fuss, are you?  Nothing a man can do when a woman make up her mind.
You get a call from Rose?
The hell is this shit?
What happened in there... that won't your fault. Ain't a young man alive could keep they britches on with that girl being in heat like she is.
I skipped lunch.
Thank you.
You know how, like they say, you save someone's life, you responsible for them. Guess he just don't think it's safe for me.
It starts like this... fire... that spreads. Starts in my head. Then moves to my stomach. Then it goes lower. I can stop it sometimes but mostly I just jump on and ride it out... then everything'll go back to normal, you know. Only thing ever took that feeling away was... was... when I met Ronnie.  Cuz I love him so much. He's all I got in my life that's special. And I like taking care of him and helping him when he gets nervous. When I can do that for him... it's like I'm givin' somethin' of myself that I haven't givin' nobody else.
I don't see why we gotta lie 'bout it when you and I know this ain't gonna work.
It's stupid... It's so fucking stupid!
Didn't know you was workin' here now?
You got any money?
Alright. How much you need, ho?
Back-up.
What are you doing?
What are you missing?  Riding your motorcycle to the nurse's house. That shit is sadder than Ethiopia.
Nick... You up?
I worked the three nine in Queens, Charlie.
Getting very weird.
... He's a sorry old guy, but I like him.
What does Ichiro mean, anyway?
"Goodness, gracious, great balls of fire."  To the killer.  Jerry Lee Lewis.
No, this is the place for the young Yakuza.
Why the hell not?
You're doing fine, Ich.  Now drop it, okay?
I'm not drunk...
... A Godfather.  His man was killed at the printing plant.
Where does this Sugai live?
Nick, you can't do this.
Grab the keys, Ich, and get inside.
Just one, compadre... Kampai.
I was ready to have your ass for taking off on me.
How many men?
Joyce?
You all right?
You can count on the truth from people who don't like you.
And I'm supposed to care?
Where's the wife?
I don't remember saying yes.
You'll get Ich killed.
Can't make you change your mind?
This is my stop.
Check your gun before you leave. They're not allowed in Japan.  It's a nice, safe country.
We're police officers.
What's this?
While you were hanging out at the visa office, we found the son-of-a- bitch.
-- Do you know where she is, detective?  Do you know how to find her?  Even where to start?  We will find them.
If I say no?
Good.
I'm sure glad you found us, Sebastian.  What do you think, Mary?
The name is Batty.  Roy Batty.
I'm surprised you didn't come to me sooner.
And what can he do for you?
Would you like to be modified?
What about your friend, the man who owns this building?
She was gonna get away.
I didn't like her.
Yeah.
If you don't, we will.  It has to be total, Deckard.  That's an order from as high as it comes.  Got it?
Yes?
Not if it works.
I think I have no money.
I like you.
Hey, it's okay.  I like to pee. So how are you doing?
Money?
Let's hear it.
Nerves of steel.
How do you mean 'exploited'?
What the fuck for?
In your opinion.
They probably want to find out when they were made.
Where is he?
Did you cry when your father died?
Have you ever cleaned your apartment?
But then how can you...
You're sick, Deckard.
Have you ever known anybody a long time?
Why do you call it retire, why don't you call it murder?
Do you think I simulated what happened between us?
May I ask a personal question?
But in your profession that is a risk.
And how is it one man will be able to cover so much ground?
I kinda get nervous when I take tests.
What?
Same thing.
How come you were in my truck?
What's your name?
I'm hungry, J.F.
Whatcha doin'?
Beautiful.
Twenty.
What makes you think so?
Hi!
Your mom was a dancer?
Very well, thank you. I'm with the County Family Services Department. Eve tells me you've been living in a bomb shelter most of your life.
Please excuse this interruption.
Eve, I don't mean to be rude, and please excuse me Cliff, but Eve, isn't Cliff just a butt with hair?
Maybe we shouldn't fight at all. Fighting is pretty immature.
Where are we going?
No, I'm lost.
I came on a bus.
Well, I guess because I'm a little psychic...I have this thing.
Yes! Yes! The Holiday Inn! That's exactly right!
Do you own a car?
I don't have to take a physical in your space ship?
It's Perry!
I can't, it's yours.
Why are you doing that?
I knew this would happen!  You're like a lost puppy!
Thank-Q!
...Okay.
Well, another day, another dollar.  Stop staring at me!!
Adam?  Don't even think about it. Okay? I'm sorry.  I know that sounds mean, but believe me, it would be meaner if I didn't say it. Okay?
I don't want to be alone.
Never drive again!
I was wrong!!
Here you go.  One champagne cocktail.
I thought only hookers drank those things.
Okay, let's see...I'm not promising anything. You okay?
In the house?
Would you do it just because you're my friend? My very best friend.
No!  Not crazy!
Quit showing off!  We're here on business!
I've never lied to you.  I've maybe let you believe things that you wanted to believe, but I've never lied.
I'm really sorry!
I know first aid!
No.
A card?
Are you all right?
I've got to go, now.
How do I leave here?
En arte voluptus. Que les bons temps roul?!
Because he's forced out at third! It's a force!
Thank you, Mom! Thanks, Dad!
Holy Cow! What the heck are these?!
C'est bon, Monsieur.
One more thing. If you find a healthy young woman, bring her back with you.
But, I don't understand.
I love Lucy!
Maybe Eve can guess.  She's psychic.
Well, we try. Listen, let me just ask you a few questions.  When did Alaska become a state?
It's so small.
I don't think so.
I guess a lot of those tall buildings we saw this morning are new.
No, I wouldn't go in one of those places with a gas mask on.
Good-bye, Adam.
Bye, Troy!
Thank you. Your father is a smart guy.
Up here on the fifteenth floor?
Sure.
See, my problem is, all I have are hundred dollar bills and I need something smaller.  Ones, fives, tens. Like that.
I didn't want to leave without saying how much I admire your jewelry.
I'm afraid you've got to.
Right.
Yes?
Oh, Adam,that would be wonderful if you could find a girl. One who's not a mutant...and hopefully comes from Pasadena. Nothing against Valley girls, but in my day anyhow, the girls from Pasadena, I don't know...always just seemed a little nicer.
No.
No, I can't have that! They'll come with their cars and their guns and their handcuffs--
You got a light, honey?
Well, put it down and come in!
It's time.
You hear that?!
Days??
Hi, honey! Feeling better?
Burnt to a crisp.  I've given you the most well-done cut.
Hot Dr. Pepper! Your favorite!
Maybe I've just got the creeps.
I've noticed.
Calvin?!
Not bad for a three and a half year old! I'd like to see the public school system match that! I don't care how terrific it is!
Get the presents and do the lights.
Let's eat our cake.
Should we say a little prayer first?
Yes, yes it is!
No, Calvin.  We're not going to make do.  Not me!  Not Adam.  We're going up no matter what!  We deserve it. Even if it's terrible!
I want him to at least see the sky!
He's smart.
How long will you set it for this time?
Go home, Cliff, wherever that might be.
So where is your roommate, the model?
You're serious, aren't you?
Hey, you're the psychic. Eve, the psychic pimp.  You tell me.
And I don't fall in love with grown men who collect baseball cards!!
Where did he get all that information?
Oh, no!
Gay.
To get some frozen poultry.
Wolf One -- say intentions.
I sent a trunk home yesterday. This is all I have.
I think it's important not to get depressed. Depression is a terrible thing. They say it can bring on illness.
Jeffrey, you're not going down by Lincoln, are you?
Well, I haven't seen any. I wouldn't worry about it. Look, I better go.
Frank. Come in.
Fuckin' good, real fuckin' good. You know this little tid bit, Dorothy, and this thing, here,  is a neighbor. What the shit we're doin' with a neighbor, I don't know. Goddam!!!  This is the suavest guy I know. Look at you. You're one beautiful fucker, Ben. I love this jacket and that cigarette holder of yours. Shit, that is too fuckin' much. Where's those glasses. This beer's gonna get too warm. I can't stand fuckin' warm beer. It makes me puke.
To your health, Frank.
Are you Detective Williams?
My name is Jeffrey Beaumont - I live near you. I believe you know my father, Tom Beaumont - Beaumont's Hardware Store?
Yeah. I've got it here in this bag. I thought I should bring it to you.
I was the same way when I was your age. I guess that's what got me into this business.
Anything you can tell me?
Jeffrey! Come on in.
Well now Jeffrey, how did you come to get so involved?
For now. Alright, you better be. And Sandy better not be involved with this, I can tell you. Be prepared to come in for further interrogation on this later.
GET OUT OF THERE!!! GET OUT!!! Put your hands up, on your head. GO ON!!! Get down on your knees - DO IT!! What are you doing? Who are you? What's your name? WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
The phone. What did you hear on the phone. Tell me. Word for word.
That's right. That's what I said. You have a good memory. Then what?
What do you want from me?
Do you like talk like that?
Don't.  I don't like that. What do you want?
Sure I'm alright. 
Don?
No.
Please don't talk like that. You're upset. I'm not helping you. I'm sorry for what I did. I better go.
Oh shit.
Falling.
Yes.
No. How could he? Don't go. You think I'm crazy, don't you? I want you to stay.  Don't hate me.
Do you want to do bad things?  Anything, anything.
I want you to hurt me.
Come on Dorothy.
Look, snap out of it, will ya?
Wait a minute. Wait. Whatiya want? For cryin' out loud!
There's no disease, I can tell you.
I'll call you.
What?
Oh no.
He's comin' back? What for?
Frank?
Look at these. What are these?
Raymond! Where's the fuckin' beer?
What time are visiting hours?
Can I use the car tonight?
It's a real good chocolate cake. Duncan Hines' devil's food. Real good.
He comes over to study.
Well.
Oh yeah?
Yeah I did, treasurer. Shouldn't you be studying or something.
I'm home from school. My father's in the hospital.
Come on, you brought it up. Do you know anything?
It's a strange world isn't it? Do you know what building the woman lives in?
That's the building. She lives on the Seventh Floor. Don't stop to look long, the police are watching.
Did they find out anything when they questioned her?
You really do hear a lot, don't you?
I have to help out in my father's hardware store. They're giving me sort of my own hours for a while, which is nice.
I've gotta go in.
I don't want to cause any trouble.
It wouldn't hurt to hear the plan, I guess.
I was just about to go to the door, when that man did my job for me. Was it alright?
I owe you, since I goofed up this one.
Yes. I do.
Jeffrey, I don't think you ought to do it.
Okay, yeah, call.
Call tomorrow. It's okay. Good luck. I hope you can sneak out okay. You're going to wait until she's asleep?
Okay, thanks.
What's with Mike?
Twice. Without her sensing anything?
You're sure right. It is a strange world.
Nothing really, but it's interesting. They know each other. They seem to like each other.
Jeffrey? Why?
Everything okay?
NO.
You want to dance?
Oh my God. What's wrong?
Sandy?
Look Jeffrey.
Mike's gotta go.  Nice to meet you.
Just for him?
Fuck you.
Listen kid, I think you better understand who you're dealing with here.
There's ways around that.
Lord's name.
Yes sir.
Poppa Joe said there was only two. In and out.  Boy, you guys sure did a good job. You're good, huh? Cool masks. Where'd you get them?
She ain't been around in weeks anyhow.
No, no. That's just not the way things are done. Besides, how's he know I don't just get in there see there's too many and just serve em their fuckin' food and beat it?
I guess we really don't have a system of deciding who.
What the fuck are you doing?
Look again for fuck sake!
Shit.
You little fuck. Let him go. I'll drop you right here.
It's all your fault. Both you little bastards. I was a fool to believe you would bring me any peace. The day your Da left us when you were almost too young to remember, he said the two of you would do me right and make me proud, but he was wrong and I got nothin' ta live for.
Well, we tried ta make friends and she gave me a shot ta the nuts.
So, how is it that you guys are fluent in Russian?
Well, we could try the bag over the head thing. Walk you right out the front.
We're alive.
Hold this shit for us, Doc. We'll be comin back for it when we get out.
Oh, Jesus.
Yeah, these guys always got a lot of rope strapped around em in the movies and they always end up using it.
I don't know they just always need it.
Where the fuck are you going?
We're doing some serious shit here. Now, get a hold of yourself, asshole.
On TV ya always get that asshole that jumps behind the couch.
Oh, we're good man.
Where are you goin'?  Did you tell him?
Who did you kill?
We've teamed up with a sex offender.
There he goes.  Okay, gentlemen. Are we ready to bring this man into the light? Are we ready to truly do the work of the Lord?
We do not want your tired and sick.
She was in here when it went down.
Well, Freud was right. So you think they came for the fag man, huh? And what do you base this upon?
The two bullets went in here, through the top of the skull, criss-crossed and exited through the eyeballs. This one clue tells us three distinct facts. Number one... Duffy.
Who the...
He's struck again, hasn't he, Greenly?
Right now.
This is some heavy shit. This is like Lone Ranger-heavy man. Fuck it! There's so much shit that pisses me off. You guys should recruit 'cause I am sick and fuckin' tired of walkin' down the street waitin' for one of these assholes to get me, y'know?
Well fuck, you guys could do this every day.
Fuck you!
Fuck it! What kind of flowers ya want at your funeral? Ya dumb Wop. This is the last time I'll see you. Bye-bye ya stupid son of a bitch.
No. You sure you're okay?
Hello?
We'll keep going, Roc.
Hello? You there?
What is it my son?
But in this day and age I believe what they do is... necessary. I feel it is... correct.
Has he now?
Yes.
Have you no fear of God?
I always see you talking to the boys and making them laugh. They always come around telling me what a crack up you are. What is it they call you?
Well, it's the funny man. Give it here, package boy.
Tell me a joke funny man. Hee Hee.
OK. That's wrong.
This is he?
Did you see that?
It had an alarm.
But he didn't say anything.
Anthony, give me the fucking gun!
Where's the manager?
I swear to God. In a very quiet voice.
Yeah.
See if mine are in there.
What about them?
I'll just say it.
This is Inez. Carmen. Anita.
Inez, this is --
May I have a word with you, please?
She's from Cuba.
Now that makes sense. We'll hang out for a couple of days. Get a little R&R. Make sure Future Man's OK and then get back on the road.
Mr. Langston performed cardiopulmonary recitation. CPR. I've never said this before, but frankly I thought Anthony was dead. The veins in his face were all sticking out. His skin was blue. He truly did look dead.
I understand that if I had a few more friends like you and Bob I'd be dead.
We're going over to this bar if you feel like going.
Why don't you come with us.
I can't believe he just jumped you.
No one to back me up. Now I have a good idea. So unless you come up with something better --
Our money situation is not good.
A $500 tip! For the housekeeper!
Who's in the car?
Mr. Henry has an inside source. We call him Steve. That's where we get our information.
You could give somebody a concussion.
Dignan. Take it easy.
You're all clear.
Not at all. The place is totally deserted.
Who did that? What the fuck is that?
Freeze!
You're kidding.
Come on.
Dignan, it's too late.
He did?
How big is it?
I think I may have found a way out of here.
That's a sharp jacket.
I'll tell you, Anthony. Times like this I get philosophical. What does it mean? What's it all about? Are you afraid to die?
Give him a second.
No, I know. I'm just saying. I feel fine. You want a piece of cake?
Let me see it.  Did you drop it?
Jesus, Bob.
We think Mr. Henry maybe --
How do you say nineteen?
Are you ever scared of finding a dead body in one of these rooms?
Does my skin feel soft, Anthony?
What?  What?
S. Cooper Trust, in San Francisco?
You don't celebrate til it's over.
Well, what do you think?
What did I say?
You said it like it was a big joke, Bob. Like he's wild.
I think we might of scared her.
What's your fucking problem? You're a shithead!
I paid for it.
Yeah. One of the nicest old guys you'd ever know.
Bob, will you please listen?
Since when is it a crime to have a scale in your house? Everybody has a scale.
So tell them the truth. What do you use it for?
Give me the keys, Dignan.
It's not your decision and he's not your brother, Dignan.
I can't fucking believe this guy. An apology, Bob?
You said 48 hours!
Scarecrow?
I couldn't hear anything.
The elevator broke.
Hold on --
I know, Bob. You were on a secret mission.
He said you ran away from home.
How long do you have to go?
Is he in?
Oh, yeah.
Is he good?
You like Chicanos?
You a good pool player.
What?
How's the weather down there?
Come on in!
No. The files are spotless. Whatever they find, it's just going to make Conklin look worse.
To know about it?  It was a kill squad. Black on black. Closed down two years ago. Nobody wants to know about Treadstone. Not around here.  You better take this back to Marty and make sure he knows what you're doing.
I want to know what happened.
And Bourne? Where's he now?
Why not? It was just money.
In the end, honestly, it's hubris. Simple hubris. You reach a point in this game when the only satisfaction left is to see how clever you are.
I did my box work, but I wanted to show you before I showed Landy. I came out here last night because none of this was making any sense. I mean, I'm with you on this, Conklin was a nut, but a traitor? I just can't get there.
Is it a slam dunk? No, but...
It's nice.  Does this picture mean anything to you?  Hmm?
I would want to know.  I would want to know that my mother didn't kill my father. I would want to know that she didn't kill herself.
That's not what happened to your parents.
Front. Use your teeth.
I'll get the book.
But we were so careful.
So...
That's crazy.
Where --
...but you're not -- you're not sure...
You drive.
You keep going to the shack. I'll meet you there in an hour.
I love you, too.
I know it's a dream.
My first job.
That's a lie!
Where am I?
Thank you for your gift. I'm sorry about Marie.
Maybe he just needed a place to spend the night?
Alright... take it down.
Show me.
How long have you worked for the agency?
Some women like Dobermans --
His wife. In room 645. Then she shot herself. 
Longshanks promised!
The weapon has been outlawed by the Pope himself!
Good day to you, M'Lords.
I am cheerful with a plan to soothe your miseries. All of England shudders with the news of renewed rebellion.
When will his trial be?
Nor you. To you that word is as unfamiliar as love.
Rest, William.
That's just a dream, William!
Three, maybe more!
They're English soldiers, ain't they?
Good to see you again.
Excellent! Stephen is my name. I'm the most wanted man on the Emerald Isle. Except I'm not on the Emerald Isle of course, more's the pity.
I am the one who is rotting. But I think your face looks graver than mine.
The Scottish nobles have sent him no support. His army starves. Our stall has worked, he must withdraw. You may return to your embroidery.
I have faced him. Have you?
-- while many who serve him have taken and broken his oath many times. I cannot commit treason, if I have never been his subject!
Thank you for accepting.
I don't want to wake. I want to stay with you.
This Scottish rebel... Wallace? He fights to avenge a woman?
Peace is made is such ways.
A meeting in a barn. It had to be a trap. And only you would know I would be aware of it.
You understand. Consider, before you laugh and say no. You will never own a throne, though you deserve one. But just as the sun will rise tomorrow, some man will rule England. And what if his veins ran not with the blood of Longshanks, but with that of a true king?
Drink this! It will dull your pain.
I'm no coward! I want what you want! But we need the nobles.
What's the crazy man saying, Lord?
Who would do such a thing?
I thought I was dead when ya pulled that dagger!
And you say he doesn't remember any of it?
Anything.
Why? What for?
Unfortunately, we've got nothing to work with. It's harder playing detective now.
Actually, these tests weren't available twenty years ago.
No dances, just tell me.
We're gonna be late again.
Did Da -- Jason --- get good grades?
Why do you ask?
I couldn't tell if they were real memories or just phantoms. You know, he might only have thought he actually remembered them...
Okay, doc. What's the damage? How much time have I got?
Hello, Evan. It's very nice to meet you.  He's as handsome as his father.
Where are you now?
Are you hurting her?
Okay. Then go a little forward in time. What do you see now?
Go on. Nothing can hurt you. Remember, this is only a movie. You're completely safe.
Hey, Evan. What's the big rush? We don't meet for another hour.
Books?
You remind me of your father. He always screamed for a photo album even though he never had one.
Are you stupid or what?
Get out. Both of you.
We should go soon. If Dad catches us smoking down here, we're dead.
Well, lately some of the memories have begun to come back and I'd kinda like to talk to you about one of them in particular. It'd be a big help.
Jesus, Kayleigh, you're...  Incredible.
Where... where are my clothes?
Ha! Where's that?
I've seen some sickening shit. I don't blink twice anymore, especially in your case.
On the bridge. How did you know that Tommy had your dog? That was no fucking hunch.
Where are we going?
Is something the matter?
I don't get it.
I was just somewhere else -- how did I get here?
It's okay. I won't bite. You've seen pictures of me, right?
There is no "right". When you change who people are, you destroy who they were.
You can't play God, son. It must end with me. Just by being here, you may be killing your mother.
Evan, you're hysterical. You study for this?
You're kidding. Are these the answers?!
Thanks. Wow. Hey, I want to do something really special for Kayleigh tomorrow. If I said I needed some help from you and the brothers...
I'm not sure. I might have gotten some stories mixed up. Did Pavlov condition his dogs to lick his nuts?
Come on, go on...
It didn't feel like a dream.
Tommy, I'm bored shitless over here. What's up already?
Hurry! Let's go! Get him up, Evan! Come on!
Look what you made me do!
I did what you said, man! We're pooling our student funds with Hillel House and we're going to have an Awareness Dance.
Lung cancer?
You put the mommy too far away. Mrs. Boswell has macaroni and glue if you wanna fix it.
The hell you aren't. Anyone of us does it, you'll puss out and narc for sure.
No, I mean, is he trustworthy? Is his word --
How long have you been married?
You want my advice?
Monsieur Rick, I --
You will find a market there for this ring. I am forced to sell it at a great sacrifice.
Such a bargain. But that is your decision?
I see.
I am so upset, Monsieur Rick. You know I can't understand --
Er, goodbye, sir.
Fine, but I would like to buy your cafe.
That's too bad. That's Casablanca's leading commodity. In refugees alone we could make a fortune if you would work with me through the black market.
Rick, I'll put my cards on the table. I think you know where those letters are.
Ah, to get out of Casablanca and go to America! You're a lucky man.
Do you know where they are?
Uh huh. Under a safe conduct from me.
There's still nobody in the world who can play "As Time Goes By" like Sam.
Yes?
That's easy. There was. He's dead.
Richard, they'll find out your record. It won't be safe for you here.
With the whole world crumbling, we pick this time to fall in love.
Ten years ago? Let's see...  ...Yes. I was having a brace put on my teeth. Where were you?
Was that cannon fire, or is it my heart pounding?
But be serious, darling. You are in danger and you must leave Paris.
I didn't count the days.
All the same, someday you'll lie to Laszlo. You'll be there.
How did you get in?
Do I have to hear again what a great man your husband is? What an important cause he's fighting for?
No. Oh, Richard, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, but, but you, you are our last hope. If you don't help us, Victor Laszlo will die in Casablanca.
But Richard, no, I, I --
We'll always have Paris. We didn't have, we'd lost it, until you came to Casablanca. We got it back last night.
Does he always leave so early?
Play it once, Sam, for old time's sake.
Victor, I, I feel somehow we shouldn't stay here.
This time they really mean to stop me.
Goodnight.
Are you ready Ilsa?
I can't get over you two. She was asking about you earlier, Rick, in a way that made me extremely jealous.
Your work.
Monsieur Blaine, I wonder if I could talk to you?
Isn't it strange that you always happened to be fighting on the side of the underdog?
You know how you sound, Monsieur Blaine? Like a man who's trying to convince himself of something he doesn't believe in his heart. Each of us has a destiny, for good or for evil.
No. It's all arranged.
Yes.
I understand.
Monsieur Laszlo, is it not?
My bill.
Ricky, you're becoming quite human. I suppose we have to thank you for that, Mademoiselle.
With pleasure. Won't you sit down?
I am afraid not. My regrets, Monsieur.
And the honor of having served the Third Reich.
By the way, Monsieur, last night you evinced an interest in Signor Ugarte.
I've never accepted that privilege, and I'm now on French soil.
And what if you track down these men and kill them? What if you murdered all of us? From every corner of Europe, hundreds, thousands, would rise to take our places. Even Nazis can't kill that fast.
Oh, there is no hurry. Tonight he'll be at Rick's. Everybody comes to Rick's.
May I recommend Veuve Cliquot '26, a good French wine.
Of course, one must admit he has great courage.
As to Laszlo, we want him watched twenty-four hours a day.
It was a combination of all three.
I was misinformed.
Rick, there's going to be some excitement here tonight. We are going to make an arrest in your cafe.
Thank you. Rick, there are many exit visas sold in this cafe, but we know that you have never sold one. That is the reason we permit you to remain open.
I think not. I have seen the lady. And if he did not leave her in Marseilles, or in Oran, he certainly won't leave her in Casablanca.
It doesn't matter. There is no exit visa for him.
That makes Rick a citizen of the world.
Well, you were asking about Rick and here he is. Mademoiselle, may I present --
Serves me right for asking a direct question. The subject is closed.
As I suspected, you're a rank sentimentalist.
How can you close me up? On what grounds?
I'll arrange to have Laszlo come there to pick up the letters of transit, and that'll give you the criminal grounds on which to make the arrest. You get him, and we get away. To the Germans that last will be just a minor annoyance.
I have the letters right here.
Where were you last night?
Come on, we're going to get your coat.
Not particularly. I understand the point of view of the hound, too.
Uh, excuse me, please. Hello, Rick.
Huh. You know, Rick, watching you just now with the Deutsches Bank, one would think you'd been doing this all your life.
But why? Oh, you object to the kind of business I do, huh? But think of all those poor refugees who must rot in this place if I didn't help them. That's not so bad. Through ways of my own I provide them with exit visas.
Perhaps an hour, perhaps a little longer.
He'll double what I pay you.
Ain't you planning on going to bed in the near future?
Boss, let's get out of here.
They grab Ugarte and she walks in. Well, that's the way it goes. One in, one out. Sam?
If she can stand it, I can. Play it!
If they can't see you, what's the point?
You fucking bleeding heart, you kill or you die.
The sea is lovely, dark and deep.
What's so damn funny?
You came on a bicycle?  No wonder it's so late.
To tell you the truth -- you did.
Sonofabitch!
Your eyes are puffy.  Did you take Valium again?
Chuck.
I can't even keep fish alive.
I have to.
What, you were going to come over the next day all calm and say, Kelly that really made me mad?  Don't tell me you're mad.  Be mad.  Be who you are right now.
I got married.
I would never --
What's that, written on the sail?
What was inside?
So simple to say, so hard to do.
I've got to get back to Memphis. Hannah's babysitter has finals.
Anything else?
Sorry...sorry... Why do my joints still ache?
Yes, yes he did.
You're not out of Pascagoula, are you?
Bless us O Lord, and these thy gifts, which we are about to receive, from thou bounty, through Christ the Lord.  Amen.
But chickens?
The place is falling apart.
Doing great, Mom, don't worry about me.
When'd you start working here?
What a journey you've had.  It seems more than a person should have to bear.
Trying.
Hmmm.  Durango, Colorado; Asheville, North Carolina, then...canceled her account.
I was making a point.
I didn't know we had sailboats.
Hello?
How about we go somewhere else?
This stinks really bad.
Cool ropes.
Must have taken a hell of a long time.
You were how long on this?
To Wilson.
Permission to come aboard, sir.
It's not ergot, it's not pituitary extract, it's not oil of rue...
*You're* a doctor, Homer--you don't smell like ether.
But you've studied with the old man for *years*!
Yeah. But sometimes I wish I could meet mine, anyway.
And that I can drive a truck!
It's gettin' late. I think I'll pack it in.
How about him not needin' the friggin' compass! How about that?
Where's Mandalay?
A movie *outside*?
At least you were never lonely.
Aren't you worried that people will cut their feet?
She won't go to St. Cloud's!
Please don't move, don't go anywhere.
I know, I'm sorry.
He's *alive*. He still loves you.  So do I.
You can trust me. Is it Jack? It's not Jack, is it? It's *Muddy*! Is it Muddy?
I thought they might take me.
Her temperature is a hundred and four.
That's a heavy sedation.
*Liver* killed him?
Did you know your mother better?
Did you grow up around here?
So, now, uh... you're not... I mean, do *you* do the--
They wouldn't take me. I'm Class IV-- I've got a heart defect.
This is all normal. Don't worry. The abortion procedure... it affects you. It's the ether, too. It'll take a little time.
What lousy luck--I mean your orders... to draw an assignment like that!
So. What should I do now?
Cider don't have no taste till later in October--it's too watery now, when we're usin' just them early Macs and them Gravensteins. You don't get no *good* cider till you're pickin' them Golden Delicious and them Winter Bananas, them Baldwins and them Russerts...
First pregnancy?
You know *how* to help these women-- how can you not feel *obligated* to help them when they can't get help anywhere else?
If you take enough of it, your intestines lose their ability to absorb Vitamin C.
I haven't, either. But you *will*. The morons who write the books should do a little research *here*.
I thought you took care of this. It always breaks in the same place. It's your splice, isn't it?
What I mean is... I would like it very much if you thought you could be happy here, Homer.
Good-bye, Arthur.  Homer, I'll see you tomorrow?
Why don't you just go back to your pickin', Homer? I can take care of it myself!
I fail to see how a little Christianity could *hurt* anyone here!
They told me I was too old to serve.
You all take care of yourself, too, Homer!
They're *outrageous*, them rules!
*What* view?
She's *good* with that knife! She's real fast. She's a lot better with that knife than *you* is, Muddy! And who do you suppose taught her?
That what happen--you lost you only daughter so's you killed yourself! That's what we say, all right.
We should drown that damn Jack in the vat!
That Candy--she's the nicest girl I know!
You're lucky he didn't cut your *nipples* off, man.
You ever see a palm tree, Homer?
Silicon Valley?
Well, typically speaking, they're not. As long as you can demonstrate --
Exactly. But the Catch-22 is that you can't tell anyone about the offer, because if it's public, you could start a bidding war and that's considered a breach of etiquette. It could kill a deal. But, wait too long and you're not considered hot anymore.
What's this?
Ten percent. Of how much?
Hey, Jake... When am I gonna get to play the Inside?
The Anti-Christ?
Your life flashing before your eyes?
Grifters...
Thanks. Did you know you shouldn't light three cigarettes with a match?
Not that I recall. What do you want us to do about it?
Ten is standard, sir.
What are you? New? Let me tell you how good this guy is. Last night, Al calls this bookie to settle up. Apparently he's been ducking him for like a month. So the guy asks him where he's got all this money all of a sudden, right? What does Al do? Does he tell him that he cashed in a fucking Bar Mitzvah bond? Does he tell him he's been giving head out back for twenty bucks a pop? No... He starts going on about this job he just pulled and how he fleeced some Wall Street asshole-type... How HE fleeced.
Big Al gets whacked mid-egg foo young. The whole thing took about two and a half hours. That's how good he is.
Fuck that. We're going too.
This might just be me, but that is hands down, the dumbest fucking idea I've ever heard.
Jake...
Moonan. Here. Shit...
What? I can feel you looking at me.
Seems Lionel Dolby came down with a sudden case of drowning last night. They just pulled him out of the East River.
When?
How much we going after?
We meet him with corporate papers, inquiring about a corporate loan for start up capital. The corporate papers are in order, but we need things to happen fast. Our guy fudges numbers in the right places, moves our papers to the top of the pile or to the bottom, depending upon what we need.
She got one leg out from under him. Now we had to lean.
You'll be there?
Jake --
Minus one.
Let me repeat -- Why not?
Fucking grifters! I love it! You got balls, I'll give you that much.
Excuse me?
What are you talking about? Ten's standard.
I don't know what you're into with the King Pin, but whatever it is we get a piece, understand? We get a big piece. If we find out you're keeping us out, I may suddenly develop a conscious and give you up to Moonan myself. Say something stupid if we got a deal, Jake.
What brings you down from Boston, Jake? Taking advantage of the long weekend?
Attractive girl.
What about... The money?
That's not --
Says who?
And some new clothes.
We're going to rope this banker tomorrow and you gotta at least look classy, if not be classy. You gotta do this thing and I don't even know if you can.
He's gone.
How do you know I will?
Who says you have to know the King to be in a hole? I actually did have a real job once. When I was in high school, I worked as a candy striper.
Stop waving that thing around.
Meet me at my place later.
No. Big con. One rag. One rag and we get out from under all this. But we need another Shill.
Then what do you want to do, Miles? Run?
Is it all fugasi?
But if you wanna talk about bad luck...
When this is all over, you're going to tell me who the King put on Al.
King ain't gonna like this.
Can I speak to you in confidence?
So what do you want?
Still time.
Do you have any idea what those monks charge for that medieval torture?
The King, huh? Nice going.
Coupla things. They got this Fed looking around and the girl just split.
So do half the other people in this place. How do I know which one?
Don't be an idiot. How hard do you think it is to sell one drug dealer's drugs to another drug dealer? If Vig's right, we might be looking at a hundred, maybe a hundred fifty grand...
Jack. Do you need a ride?
The Indian rope-trick.
What are you laughing at? Who was that on the phone?
What?!
Eight-fifty.
She went back to South Africa.
Hi-ya... I'll call you back.  Now then...
Right.  Look, I must get back to Habib.
Jack, look, next weekend I'm having a house party. Here...  It's near Oxford. Why don't you come? It'll just be social. No business.  Bring a friend. I've plenty of room.
No, no. I'm not ready for you. There's some vodka in the freezer.
Take it back. Till you sell your book.
It came my way. 450 a week.
I can just imagine, being around so much money all the time...
How did you know I was here?
I don't want a criminal for a boyfriend.
It's probably easier for you to eat the rice.
Nothing about you.
What?
Great.
Yes, I know that.
I'm sorry, madam, we don't accept gratuities in the UK. It's different in South Africa.
I'm not much of a gambler really. I just like this bar.
I was at a loose end. A friend of a friend gave me a courtesy membership.
Near the casino.
I loved the atmosphere. But it destroyed my poor mother.
What happened?
I owe a lot of money.
Just listen. You don't have to do anything criminal.
You don't have to be criminal. A man will come up to your table and deliberately cheat. You'll see him, stop him, and the guy will make a big scene. There'll be chaos. And that's when it'll happen.
And I thought you were only after my body.
Did they tell you to sleep with me?
Is it yes?
Yes.
Where to?
I'm off to a little watering hole. Why don't you join me? Relax.
What are you, a cop?
And the girls?
What? You know what happened to me, don't you? That bitch Bella shopped me. I'd like to beat the shit out of her.
I'm sorry, sir, that's a late bet.
You don't recognise me? You had me barred. You fucking little worm.
Where's the magnet?
Let me just run through a few things. As a dealer you never gamble, not anywhere. We'll need your picture.
Ever?
You can start Monday week.
I can tell, the damn thing just doesn't understand.
The key!
The key, goddamit, the key!
It didn't go off.
What was that, I didn't hear...
Find me something, I don't care where it is.
It's a goddamn wild goose chase. Remember when Commander Powell found that 99 plus probability of sentient life in the Magellanic Cloud?
Why doesn't Talby ever eat down here with the rest of us?
Quantum is up thirty-five.
Rechannel all safety relays --
All right, I have detonation time at... Wait a minute, something's wrong with the clock.  All right, I have detonation time at... no, that can't be right, it says three years.  Okay, I have six minutes exactly. Does that check out down there?
Right, that synchronizes here. Okay, bomb, arm yourself.
Everything sounds fine, bomb. Dropping you off in sixty seconds. Good luck.
You won't consider another course of action, for instance just waiting around awhile so we can disarm you?
The only thing which exists is myself.
Hello, bomb, are you with me?
Are you willing to entertain a few concepts?
Hmm... Well, I think, therefore I am.
Exactly.
And you can only do it once, right?
And you wouldn't want to explode on the basis of false data, would you?
Well then, you've already admitted that you have no real proof of the existence of the outside universe.
Yes, of course you remember it, but what you are remembering is merely a series of electrical impulses which you now realize have no necessary connection with outside reality.
Ah, what was that again, I still can't hear you?
I need a GHF reading on the gravity correction.
Pinback...
New star.  Hey, guess what? I got a new star on the readout.
Commander Powell would have named it.
Hello, Pinback, are you there?
Lieutenant Doolittle, this is Talby. Lieutenant?
Ah, Lieutenant Doolittle? Sir?
Before we get too far away, and our signals start to fade, I just wanted to tell you... you were my favorite. I really liked you, Doolittle.
Commander Powell, this is Doolittle. Ah, there's something serious come up, sir, and I have to ask you something.
Well, sir, the Dodgers broke up, disbanded over thirteen years ago.
Yes sir. Negative effect.
Negative effect.
That's correct, sir.
Commander Powell? Commander, hello!
What were you saying, Commander, about the bomb?
Men... men... what happened, men?
I never woulda done it.  Probably not, anyway.  I mean, I actually think you're pretty cool.
You're attractive, you're smart.  Stand on your own two feet, know what I mean? And you got a wicked sense of humor. Man, you really zinged the boss a couple times, it was all I could do--
Fine.  So call her.  Get her over here.
See what you don't know is you're already in the last two minutes of your life.
I'm hired to do a piece of work, my mark goes down and stays down.  Your's makes it to the hospital where you then gotta go finish the job.  Only the cops got the whole thing on video tape.
Some of us are trying to sleep.
'Cause you went out the back door and nailed her girlfriend?  Who would take offense to that?
Trying to have a relationship with you, Max, is like standing in a fog bank.  You know you're in the middle of something only you have absolutely no idea where you are.
I shouldn't do this.  But I got a client lookin' to score some fire power.  Maybe you'll keep your eyes open for me.
Your daughter's the only leverage they have to keep you quiet.
Because we can't.  There's nothing here for us anymore.
Don't worry, I'm coming to get you.
Soon, baby.
You're a thief?
I was expecting someone else.
What's your shot in all this?  Being a famous, anonymous, underground, pirate, cyber-journalist can't be much of a payday.
You miss the good ol' days.  Even though there were still poor people who died from diseases when they didn't have to. And rich people spent obscene amounts of money redecorating their houses to match the cat.  Those good ol' days?
Ever notice how cats always seem to turn up around dinner time?
Like following me around and pestering the people I work with wasn't bad enough, but breaking into my apartment--
Am I s'posed to be grateful?
Whoa there, Tex!  We've been through all this.
I'm sorry.  It wasn't my intention.  But I had to see you.
Expensive gifts, surprise late-night visits, over-the-top flattery... You always come on this strong?
I don't know what kind of game you're playing here but I'm out because you are a whack-job.
I remember fine.  I just didn't understand what was going on.  They never told us anything except what to do.  It took me a long time afterwards to figure things out.
Christmas is a snap when you got no parents or relatives, just a bunch of gene sequences from probably twenty different people.
What's in it for you?
Yeah, I catch your hacks.  He's Satan's lap dog, or something.
I didn't make it this far by attracting a lot of attention.
See you're back and still rocking the boat.
You believe that?
These girls, kidnapped during the last month and sold overseas to the highest bidder.  The oldest is twelve.  The youngest about the same age you were when you escaped.
With your help.
That was taken nine years ago... I.D.'d as Michael Hanover.  Sentenced to 18 months in the state penn at Rawlins, Wyoming for armed robbery.  He escaped from custody after 4 days.  Hasn't been seen or heard from since.
Know where I can find her?
I need to talk to her.
Who is it?
How do I know you're telling the truth?
She was a nurse.  She must've lived near there, somewhere, near the...  ...the clinic.  There must be some registry of nurses or medical technicians or whatever for Wyoming.
They lifted my wallet to make it look like a robbery.  But there's a bug in my computer keyboard, a tap on the phone and a mike in the light fixture.
I need a favor... I need you to trace a number for me.
Zero... C'mon, Dan I don't have all day.
Just give it to me.  I'll remember.
Now, why can't I find a girlfriend like that?  Brings him lunch everyday, thoughtful, sweet, legs from here to there--
Who are you?
She's got my word.
Right, the big one-oh.
What happens if you level with her?
Convinced her she needed to visit her mom in San Mateo.
Max, what did I do to deserve a friend like you?
This is a hot run.  Beat it.  You're late.
Hot run to 842 Beulah, corner of Haight... And you can tell your pal Theo he just got his worthless ass fired. Not that he cares but the wife and kid might.
What the hell is that?
Whoa. Some of this hard liquor's a tad too manly for me. I'm a brewski man myself.
You're a little scrawny, but thanks to the concert we're low on amateurs. Name?
Whoa... she is a killer.
Jeremiah?
I didn't mean for that to be so... intense. Forgive me.
Ann Arbor?
Well, the least we, his only buds in the world, can do is take him along with us tonight and give him one last curl before he starts serving his sentence.
...at twenty-thirty hours.
That's Sherry VanHafton.
Too bad we're stuck in electronics or...
Hawk, all I need is one ding on the Volvo and presto! There are my balls hanging from the rearview mirror after she gets back from Cincinnati.
Very funny, Hawk. Okay, I'm in on this hare-brained scheme, but if anything happens to my mom's car, I'm blaming you. I'll say you drugged me or something.
Could be.
Dude, this is all I got.
Don't worry about it. They're perfectly safe. We can pick them up after school. My mom won't be home. It's no problem.
Oh, I'm sorry, Trip. What you made was a big, brainless, pile of horse shit. No offense.
I got...
But, mom!
Okay, you better have something really sinful for me this time, son. My patience is worn to threads and your mom will be here any minute.
Well? Continue! Continue!
Oh, everything's hunky-dory now that the shit hit the fan just like you said it would, you snug sonofabitch! You fuckin' jinxed us!
Well, here we are back at fucking school again.
It's gone.
Please sir, don't beat me up. I do have a KISS ticket, but not on me.
Two hundred bucks?
I did?
Now that's better... but I still sense some students out there... who are AFRAID... just to say GOOD MORNING!
What was his name?
What effect do you think this would have on an infant?
I'm not following you.
You are contradicting yourself, Donnie. If we could see our destines manifest themselves visually... then we would be given the choice to betray our chosen destinies. The very fact that this choice exists... would mean that all pre-formed destiny would end.
When can I squeeze one out?
How can you do that?
How much longer is this gonna last?
What'd you do, Donnie? What'd you do!
Hey...
Wow. Did he go to jail?
Do you ever feel as though there's always someone watching you?
That's not good enough. You've got to go back in time and take all those hours of darkness and pain and replace them... with whatever you wanted.
We're moving through time.
Oh, yeah.  "The Philosophy of Time Travel". What is this?
I know she's here. She never leaves the house.
What? How long was I asleep?
My mom is gone.
I don't know. She didn't leave a note. The house is all messed up.
What?
Will you still be working at Yarn Barn? 'Cause that's a great place to raise children.
He can't, Samantha. He's been suspended from after-school activities. Donnie... are you still with us?  How was your therapy session tonight?
So how was school today?
Good Lord.  So the construction guys say it'll take about a week to fix the roof. Damn airline better not fuck us on the shingle match.
Know what?
You're right. Roberta Sparrow was famous for her gem collections. Kids used to try and steal stuff from her all the time. Over the years... as she got older, she became more and more of a recluse... now she just likes to stay up there all by herself.
Who's been giving you weird looks?
And when the other rabbits hear of Fiver's vision, do they believe him?  It could be the death of an entire way of life, the end of an era.
Because the rabbits are us, Donnie.
Cellar door.
I think he saved my life.
Don't you watch the news?
Frank... instructed you... to get out of bed... just before this happened.
Follow him where?
Who is the boss?
What about your family, Donnie?
How many times have you seen Frank?
Who is they? Is Frank part of some larger group?
I'd like to believe that I'm not... but I've just never seen any proof. So I just choose not to bother with it. It's, like, I could spend my whole life thinking about it... debating it in my head. Weighing the pros and cons. And in the end, I still wouldn't have any proof. So... I don't even debate it any more. Because it's absurd.  I don't want to be alone.  So, does that make me, like, an atheist?
So, your parents... why did you disappoint them?
They... didn't buy me what I wanted for Christmas that year.
I have to obey him... because he saved my life. He controls me and I have to obey him or I'll be left all alone... and I'll never figure out what all of this means...
I think so. I think that's one of the clues. It's a clue that tells us... to keep going.
Whoa, Elizabeth. A little hostile, there. Maybe you should be the one in therapy. Then Mom and Dad can pay someone two hundred dollars an hour to listen to all of your thoughts... so we won't have to.
What's her name?
No I don't.  She worries about you.
It's not that. I mean mouthing off to your teachers. I'll admit... when Dad told me what you said to Ms. Farmer, I laughed my ass off.
I think you are afraid to ask me for advice. I think that you are a very troubled... confused young man. I think you're searching for answers in all the wrong places.
Frank... the giant bunny rabbit?
Donnie is experiencing what is commonly called a daylight hallucination.
What?
I haven't been accepted yet, mother.
Here are the keys to the Taurus. There's plenty of groceries in the fridge. And I left money on the kitchen table. And don't forget...
Christ. Is that an axe?
Do you even know who Graham Greene is?
Maybe Martha Moo finally went nuts and hijacked the bus.
What is wrong with you?
No. It's pure bullshit, sweetie. You're lucky as hell, so you might as well enjoy it. Let's get you a root beer float.
I never liked her, but she didn't deserve to die in the belly of a swan like that. The whole thing's just kinda sad and lame at the same time.
All right, say "Airport Ho-Jo."
Loretta, don't do that.
Oh, Amber...
Shut up, yous guys. Look, Amber, I'm not gonna win. And let's be honest, a family only needs one "Liza" and you know Peter's got much better legs than me.
Then do it for Peter. Mrs. Leeman used to call him a "skinny little fag" when he'd bag her groceries. He'd pop his Nancy-belt if his old jacket somehow, I don't know, got her back.
Mrs. Leeman?
Oh shit!
Oh, Mom, it's so ugly.
Mom!
Oh, c'mon... First the picture of Tammy, then Brett Clemens, now this? It's scary.
Uh, Amber? We're not puttin' on our Talent costumes. You need to put on your "Physical Fitness" outfit. And let's shake a leg, ladies.
If you want seconds, then I'll make sure it's hot enough for ya.
And the bite marks on my ears?
So, uh, I -- I'm not really busy Friday. I just said that -- y'know.
It's just the guys that are... you know, makin' the movie about the pageant. I told you about 'em.
Let's just say who should win, who deserves to win is Amber.
Well, it's all happenin' so fast. Goodness-gracious, it hardly seems real, y'know? I mean, I won! I'm the winner! I'm going to State!
Oh for chrissakes, everything smells like that in Mexico.
I'm a mirror.
...Oh, yeah-right. I ain't gonna be in no goddamn pageant! Look what happened to that dork-ass farm girl.
Hey, ya like it? Open it... Yah -- the globe. Pull at the equator there.
Hey! Turn that float around. You think a swan's gonna swim ass first up Main Street?
Iris, stop!  It's not his fault. The communal wine just proves too temptin' for some of them.
Well, you know, I think everyone's doing really well considering the fact that she was so young.
So, remember the three most important parts of a good interview...
I will if you shut your piehole.
Excuse me, Father, Mother, when are we moving back to Tokyo? I can't stand this place anymore. They put butter on everything.
Oh, I almost forgot...  I got my acceptance to Tokyo University.
Who to?
My dear President...  read it back...
That doesn't sound right...  take out "President"...  now read it.
That's not right yet... put back "President" and take out "dear"... How does it read now?
Here I am, Father...
I wonder what's keeping His Excellency?
Half watch dog?
'At's-a no good.  I went to Niagara Falls once.
I don't wanna work at all.
Then we've gotta start one. Do you know how to start a war?
Send in the next girl. 
I'm glad I didn't ask you for "Washington Crossing the Delaware".
He's going to make a good spy... that's not bad for the first day.
You're right about that guy -- I think we've got something.
I wish you were still working for me, so I could ask you to resign. How're ya fixed for cavalry?
How'm I doing, boss?
I will not stand for anything that's crooked or unfair; I'm strictly on the up and up, So everyone beware. If anyone's caught taking graft And I don't get my share, we'll stand 'em up against the wall - and pop goes the weasel!
Are you sure you're not tired?
Well, in the meantime, could you let me have $50 personally?
I'll tell you what I'll do.  I'll give you Mrs. Teasdale as security.  or my jackknife.  If you want my advice, you'll take the jackknife... I've a better proposition...  Make it $25 and I'll give you a first mortgage on my son and I hope you foreclose.
Excellency, may I present my niece.
When you get through with her feet, you can start on mine.  I haven't been to a chiropodist in two years...  If that's not an insult, I don't know what is.  Gloria, I love you.  I --
This has gone far enough!  This interruption is humiliating, to say the least...
Give me that again!
Then it's war?
How're ya fixed for ammunition?
In choosing you, I feel that I serve my country well.  I heartily endorse everything you stand for.
Your Excellency, something terrible has just happened.
I said - I suspect the Secretary of War.
Your uncle has been such a friend to us in every crisis.  Without his country's financial aid --
Ambassador!  I am so anxious for you to meet our new dictator.
Mrs. Teasdale, I'm willing to pocket my pride and do anything I can to make up with his Excellency.
Maybe it's not going to be so easy. From what I've heard, Mrs. Teasdale is rather sweet on this Rufus T. Firefly.
Uncle, you can't do this!
Did it go well, darling?
Yes, and they send their kisses. Would you like your sherry now?
Freddie?... Freddie, don't look so discouraged.
Perhaps you're just polishing a stone, endowing this Elephant Man with qualities he doesn't possess?
Yes.
Excuse me, Mr. Treves, sir.
Our man is sick. Come right away.
Like this. 
He's doing it to spite me, I tell you, and it's got to stop!
Good! How is the patient?
Two o'clock then... you know Treves... It seems this acquaintance of yours has become rather more than just an acquaintance.
Yes, I spoke to both the British Home and Royal Hospital for Incurables. I'm afraid that they weren't very encouraging, but they said they'd bring it up at their next committee meeting, so we should have their answers shortly.
Can you imagine what his life has been like?
Excellent. We shall present them, along with the other particulars of the case to the committee. I want them to see, exactly, how horribly his body has been affected. You and I shall vouch for his inner qualities.
Don't we?
Don't you think this is a bit premature? We don't have the backing yet to...
Are you comfortable here?
Fair Katharine, and most fair, will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier terms Such as will enter at a lady's ear And plead his love-suit to her gentle heart?
Mr. Treves says that you are in the theatre. Do you live there?
Tell me about it, please!
It's all arranged. I'll send over some evening gowns for the sisters that you select to accompany Mr. Merrick. You'll be using the Royal entrance and Princess Alexandra herself will be there to welcome him to her private box.
How awful for John.
Want to come out?
Feeling better now, Mr. Merrick?
What? Oh! I see! It's St. Phillips. Oh, of course. Why... why that's very good, I mean you've gotten the windows and arches just right.
What's this?
Yyyy... Yyye... yyyess.
...Yyes
My... name is...
Mmmerrick.
Why, my dear Mrs. Mothershead, how good of you to join us. Mr. Merrick, will you please introduce yourself?
Why did you let me go on like that, teaching you what you already knew? Why didn't you tell me you could read?
John... what's the matter? John... why are you upset?
Well, it's a lovely bedroom. What do you call that thing above the bed?
The children! May I see?
Good morning, John.
How blind of me. Is there anything else, John, anything at all that I could get for you?
You want a dressing bag, John?
My home.
Is it the one you wanted?
Ah, Mothershead. How are you feeling today?
Good Lord, Mr. Treves!
Yes sir.  What's that?
So you see, John, there's no need for a lighthouse. All your friends are here.
Are you the proprietor?
I'd pay handsomely for a private showing. Are you the proprietor?
Pardon me?
Well... where is he?
It's all right! It isn't happening!
WELCOME?
Oh, for goodness' sake!
That's just what I was trying to tell you. You ARE...
You're as bad as my father.
But you don't realize....
Then I shall come too.
LOKI! Where did YOU come from?
How do we know this is the way?
Is it night or day, Erik?
Er... well... we... we... would be TERRIBLY grateful if you... all... would sing for us.
No. 
We're just not a very musical nation...
I'll tell you what...
Careful!  They're not supposed to hurt you.
He's trying to stop us waking the Gods.
Because that's how he makes his money, by war and plunder!
Well, it's not called the Horn Resounding for nothing.  You DO know how to play the horn, don't you?
But it IS! Look!
Looting and pillaging, eh?
It's obvious you haven't raped anyone in your life.
No... right... this is RAPE... Mark you, I'm not saying I couldn't get to like you... in fact... well, to be quite honest, I prefer it when there's some sort of mutual feeling between two people...
I don't suppose... no...
Oh! Stop talking as if we were married!
I just said I didn't feel like raping you.
Why should you care?
Why?
FIND the Rainbow Bridge?
"But" what?
Let's hack her to pieces.
Halfdan the Black's here!
But. You're not even afraid of DEATH, Thorfinn!
It's always the women that start the trouble.
Slower! In... Out...
Ohh! I wanted to sit next to Leif.
You mean we'd be dead?
A magic dishcloth.
No! Let go, Snorri!
Bjorn's not. He could have Bjorn's place.
So Halfdan the Black's using magic, is he? Well, I have a magic to match his! 
What are you talking about, Erik?
Look, I bagged it last week.
Yeah... well...
Vanish into thin air?
You coming? You don't even believe in Asgaard.
There was Thorbjorn Vifilsson's wife. You converted HER.
I know. I know.
He used to puke in his sleep.
And a sort of slightly sick feeling?
I'm not worth risking your life for.
What?
If this IS the Age of Ragnarok, Keitel Blacksmith, it is GOOD to us.
My brother blacksmiths!
Together we stand!
You must only let the red rage take hold of you in the thick of battle.
I must KILL! Kill!
Well, of course he is!
Well, go on! Go berserk!
Well... I'm game.
And you've got BOTH axes?
And keep your sword greased.
You weren't supposed to see that.
I remember you turned around. Your face was dark and your hair was backlit -- I could see a halo of frizz -- you asked me if things were okay between Naomi and me.
Shit. The last time I saw you.
I mean, it's okay if you want to sit down here. I didn't mean to --
-- because I go there all the time. I don't think I ever saw you before.
I don't have one.
Yeah. Tom Waits says it in --
I don't really know how --
You think that could possibly be a full time job? How many hair colors could there be?
You sure? That doesn't sound --
Sorry. I was just trying to be nice.
No jokes about my name? Oh, you wouldn't do that; you're trying to be nice.
Huckleberry Hound?
Huckleberry Hound! What, are you nuts?
Why wouldn't you think that about me?
I don't need nice. I don't need myself to be it and I don't need anyone else to be it at me.
Joel? It's Joel, right?
I'm sorry I... yelled at you. Was it yelling? I can't really tell. Whatever, I'm a little out of sorts today.
Look, I'm very sorry I came off sort of nutso. I'm not really.
Me too. It is Rain Dogs, by the way.
God, that feels so fucking good. Take yours off.
Ready for another?
No. I --
Sorry. My life isn't that interesting. I go to work. I go home. I don't know what to say.
Yeah.
Oh, thank God. It's going.
You're drunk.
Joely...
Oh?
Wow. Um, well... can't you just force yourself awake?
You know, we're okay. They're not finding us. You'll remember me in the morning. And you'll come to me and tell me about us and we'll start over.
I scoured the city for it.
I didn't think you'd show your face around me again. I figured you were humiliated. You did run away, after all.
Well, you're married.
Joel, I'm not a concept. I want you to just keep that in your head. Too many guys think I'm a concept or I complete them or I'm going to make them alive, but I'm just a fucked-up girl who is looking for my own peace of mind. Don't assign me yours.
You should try Xanax. I mean, it's a chemical and all, but it works... and it works just having it around, knowing that it's there. Like insurance.
Me too. There's this poem --
C'mon, man. The water's fine. Nobody's coming here tonight, believe me. This place is closed up. Electricity's off.
What if you stay this time?
Bye, Joel.
A bully? Moi?
Says you were constantly calling me a slob.  It's sexy that we were like a married couple, griping and overly-familiar and bored. Don't you think?
Yay. Meet me after work by the old mill.
It's true.
How's it going?
The driver waved. So casual, friendly.
Clementine.
Gotta get home. How could she do this to me? How could she not care about what we meant to each other. What a fuck! What a fucking monster she is!
So then she just stops calling.
How's the chicken?
She's so sexy.
Naomi.
So you're still on the Zoloft?
Clementine.
We'll start with your most recent memories and go backwards -- There is an emotional core to each of our memories -- As we eradicate this core, it starts its degradation process -- By the time you wake up in the morning, all memories we've targeted will have withered and disappeared. Like a dream upon waking.
We can help you through this. Why don't you start now by telling me everything you can remember about --
What? What do you mean?
Yours?
What?
Don't say "we" when you mean "you."
Bullshit. Who is it? You met someone.
Hi, Rob and Carrie.
So... you haven't been involved with anyone in all this time?
Oh, hey, Patrick.
Stan... c'mon...
Hey, if you're ordering lunch for Mierzwiak, would you --
It's stopped.
I don't know what to do! I don't know what to do! Crap. Crap...
Hey.
I swear.
I really like you, Mary. You know that.
What's this?
Thanks.
Okay, um, there's one that goes "Blessed are the forgetful, for they get the better even of their blunders."
There's another one I like, I read. It's by Pope Alexander.
You made me have you erased! I loved you. I love you! How could you --
Well, where was Patrick?
Mary. What are you doing here?
Mary has stolen our files and is sending them back to people.
I wonder if I should invite my girlfriend over, too. I have a girlfriend now.
I gotta tell you something. I kind of fell in love with her last night.
Oh? Well, there's been some trouble on the ranch. I came up here to get out of the way. It's so dark now I doubt if I could find my way back down. If you could help...
But I don't know how to polka.
But that's an old story now...... I can't believe that you would leave the Butte.
Suppose that you bear five or six children with your characteristics. All in Siwash Cave. In a postcatastrophe world, your offspring would of necessity intermarry, forming in time a tribe. A tribe every member of which had giant thumbs. A tribe of Big Thumbs would relate to the environment in very special ways. It could not use weapons or produce sophisticated tools. It would have to rely on its wits and its senses. It would have to live with animals -- and plants! -- as virtual equals. It's extremely pleasant to me to think about a tribe of physical eccentrics living peacefully with animals and plants, learning their languages, perhaps, and paying them the respect they deserve.
Where do you live, Miss Hankshaw?
Where are the others?
Tell me about it.
......Delores zonks out on peyote at least once a week, but so far her Third Vision hasn't happened. Niwet?kame, the Mother Goddess has not gotten back in touch with her. Meanwhile she and Debbie are rivaling each other like a couple of crosstown high schools. Tension. Cowgirl tension! What a drag.
I think she's disappointed that I'm not more, ah, sort of atavistic. She's got some naive, sentimental notions about Indians. I'm sure she liked me, though; but.... then she left town.
What do you think?
Whose fault was that?
What do they do to you boys in those Ivy league schools, anyway? Strap you down and pump the Nature out of you? They can even press the last drop of Nature out of a Mohawk buck. Why, send a shaman or cannibal to Yale for four years and all he'd be fit for would be a desk in the military-industrial complex and a seat in the third row at a Neil Simon comedy. Jesus H.M.S. Christ! If Harvard or Princeton could get hold of the Chink for a couple of semesters they'd turn him into a candidate for the Bow Tie Wing of the Hall of Wimps. Oogie boogie.
But I don't want you to leave. Please stay. We can go to dinner. I owe you a dinner. And tonight... we can... really make love.
To my own special Sissy. Cheers! And welcome. So my letter brought ya flying, eh? Where were you? Salt Lake City? La Conner? Well, I may have a little surprise for you. But first, tell me about yourself. It's been six months, hasn't it? In some circles that's half a year. How are you?
You were the Yoni Yum girl from, let's see,  from nineteen sixty-eight through nineteen seventy. You've always smelled so nice. Like a little sister. The irony has just killed me. You, the Dew Girl, one of the few girls who doesn't need Dew. I loath the stink of females! They are so sweet the way God made them, then they start fooling around with men and soon they're stinking. Like rotten mushrooms, like an excessively chlorinated swimming pool, like a tuna fish's retirement party. They all stink. From the Queen of England to Bonanza Jellybean, they stink.
But Countess...
Yes, well, what I'm getting at is that there comes a time when it is psychologically impossible for a woman to lose her virginity. She can't wait too long, you know. Now, there's no reason why you must lose yours. I mean, just ponder it a bit, that's all.
Shit! Do not do that! Where the fuck are you?
Okay, listen up. As you all know by now, we have an addition to our crew. Dr. Weir, this is: Starck, navigation; Smith, pilot, Justin, ship's engineer --
...cancel our leave and send us out on some bullshit mission...!
...come on, Skipper, I already put my shoes on...
But Justin...
Captain Miller, we're ready to repressurize the Clark.
...and the gravity drive goes where no man has gone before.
Coffee.
The Event Horizon only had life support for eighteen months. It seems impossible, but in light of the transmission... I have to think that someone has managed to endure until now.
It was like... nothing was there... and then Justin appeared and the Core... became metal...
Is that an offer?
Let me breathe, let me breathe...
How? The Bridge is gone.
What...?
I, I tried to go back for him, to save him, but I couldn't get to him in time. The fire... Have you ever seen fire in zero-gravity? It's like a liquid, it slides over everything. It was like a wave breaking over him, a wave of fire. And then he was gone.  I never told anyone until now. But this ship knew, DJ. It knows about the Goliath, it knows about Corrick. It knows our secrets. It knows what we're afraid of.  And now you're going to tell me it's carbon dioxide.
What is it?
They thought it said, "Liberatis me," "Save me," but it's not "me." It's "tutemet:" "Save yourself."
DJ. The Clark's gone. Smith and Cooper are dead.
What's wrong?
That ship was lost in deep space, seven years ago. If the Titanic sailed into New York harbor, I'd find it more plausible.  Houston wants Aerospace to send out a search and rescue team, investigate the source of the transmission. If it really is the Event Horizon, they'll attempt a salvage.  We need you to prepare a detailed briefing on the ship's systems for the salvage crew...
You're not seriously considering sending him?
I want our best people on this. Where's Miller?
What, Justin, what shows you?
Oh my god OH MY GOD...
...is zero. That's what the singularity does: it folds space, so that point A and point B coexist in the same space and time. After the ship passes through this gateway, space returns to normal.  It's called a gravity drive.
I've reached another containment door. This thing's huge...
Justin, finish your sweep.
Patch me through to him.
Okay. I'm on the bridge.
Peters...
Peters, I want you to go through the ship's log, see if we can't find some answers.
Captain Miller, I just want to say...
I've been authorized to brief you and the crew once we reach Neptune space.
You're in the central corridor. It connects the personnel areas to Engineering.
I can see that, what're they for?
It beats dying, Mister Smith.
Yes.
Hold on, what's this "gravitational distortion?"
What about it?
Explanation?
I want to know what caused that noise. I want to know why one of my crew tried to throw himself out of the airlock.
You can't leave. She won't let you.
I told you... She won't let you leave...
If you miss me, you'll blow out the hull. You'll die too.
Weir is dead.
There is no Devil. There is no God. There is only... NOTHING.
Heading three-three-four...
Put it through TACS. Smith, you up for a flyby?
But...
Captain Miller, you copy?
Oxygen is not the problem.
The Event Horizon sensors show the same thing: "Bio-readings of indeterminate origin." Right before that wave hit the Clark, there was some kind of surge, right off the scale, but now it's back to its previous levels.
I don't know, but whatever it is, it's not the crew.
Weir can't be alive.
First time in a grav couch?
Claire...
No. I saw nothing.
There's no one in the corridor but us.
I didn't see anything and I don't have to see anything. This ship is fucked.
You can't do that.
If they are, they're screening their calls.
The scope is lit, it's right in front of us...
Range 500 meters and holding. Turbulence is dropping off...
What happened to his eyes?
Relativity, yes. We can't break the law of relativity, but we can go around it. The ship doesn't really move faster than the speed of light; it creates a dimensional gateway that allows the ship to instantaneously "jump" from one point in the universe to another, light years away.
The reactor's still hot. We've got several small radiation sources, leaks probably. Nothing serious.
That's how the gravity drive works, you see: it focuses the black hole's immense gravitational power to create the gateway. That's how the Event Horizon travels faster than light.
Claire is your wife?
In our current environment, Dr. Weir, self-control is an asset.
Justin said something about, "The dark inside me..." What did he mean?
I don't think She's real big on hate.
You know, you could'a run an ad in the personals.
I mean...
We can monitor the cloud's approach and observe the tests from here.
What are you doing here?
Ben, come in.
What do you want, Vic?
When have I asked you to do something you absolutely said you could not do?
Are you alright?
We had a tough year.
Ben, I've been crunching the numbers on the machine. I think if we can rework the power settings...
Reed?... Sue?
The machine works. And Vic's gone Mister Hyde on us --
No more cracks about how I look.
And where do we think we're going?
I mean, you feel a little feverish.
My shift ends at four, but I couldn't --
Now what is up with that?
Not only could you kill yourself, but you could set fire to Earth's atmosphere and destroy all human life as we know it.
That's what I'm trying to calculate. And it's not rubber. It's muscle, tendon. I seem to have the ability to manipulate the malleability of my molecular structure and redistribute my density to --
Johnny. SUPERNOVA.
Apparently I can disappear.
Stop it.
What is that thing?
You two need a time-out.
Johnny? Did you see Ben?
Johnny, slow down. Think. You know mom didn't raise us to --
Front page?
You're, you've, I mean, how have you bee--
As far as crew, I was hoping Ben could pilot the mission --
That's good. That's uh... good.
For science.
Uh, Sue...? I can't.
It has to be the cloud. It's fundamentally altered our DNA.
What?
I'm saying, if you had a little more self control, you could locate the trigger. Can you remember the exact emotions when --
Okay. Is there any way to duplicate that feeling? Some memory or...
Remember our first date here...? God, I was so nervous.
You always talked about how you liked the kind of man who could approach you... speak his mind. One who wasn't afraid to tell you what he wanted.
I found a broken gasket, from space --
This isn't going to be a problem, is it?
But I'm not done with the machine --
Surprised I agreed to Reed's proposal?
Uh, Victor, I hope I haven't done something to make you think...
What's going on?
Victor, I'm sorry I --
You said it was urgent.
He's working round the clock. But the data needs to be tested, analyzed before --
Brad, can I talk to you a minute?
What's there to do at the Point? God, Lisa, we've been going together almost two years, and...
Tool? Tool for what? We've been going together almost two years!
I'm just glad we're still together, Lisa, because I need you this year.
Something happened to them, mon.
On the ledge?
But you took off your Captain Kidd uniform.
I'm sorry, sir. Just let me find the forms here.
It's just some guy I met at Swenson's. You don't know him.
You're going to break up with Lisa, aren't you?
Why? Because she won't sleep with you?
Leave me alone.
Jeff you have company!
You know Mark Ratner really likes you. You like him?
I guess the annuals are coming in pretty soon. Are you going to get one?
Listen. I feel pretty strange here. Because Mark really likes you, and he's my friend.
You're a really good kisser.
I want you to know that it's your final decision if we should continue or not.
Hey, Mike?
I think we're making a lot of noise.
What's wrong?
What's going on?
There's only one thing we can do. We've got to get rid of it. We've got to get an abortion.
You... are a wuss. Part wimp. Part pussy.
It's definitely your mama.
That's the idea, Rat. That's The Attitude.
Hey, Rat.
And that is how you talk to a girl, Rat. Voila. You can't miss.
Yo.
Did you go home and get it?
Jesus. I'm sorry.
You're losing it, Damone.
All right, what you want to do is go to the Free Clinic and tell the doctor that you have sex regularly -- several times a week -- and that you need Nornel One Plus Fifty's.
Not if you're over sixteen.
Who's that?
Are you going to ride that wave?
Seen the new Playboy?
My brother is going to kill us. He's gonna kill you and then he's gonna kill me. He's gonna kill us.
Don't you like him?
Come on, Linda, I haven't had a boyfriend all summer. You promised when I started working at the mall that my life would change... Do you think he'll call this week?
Face it. With some guys you have to make the first move. A lot of guys are just... wussies.
Linda. That girl looks just like Pat Benatar.
Yeah but they look more sophisticated. You'd probably think they'd be better in bed.
No there are variables that, like, I might not be good at.
Just kidding. About 10cc.
You've got to get used to working Christmas. People are always screaming and yelling... then they get home and they're all Christmasy.
Stacy! I've got water in my ears. Do you have any Q-Tips?
You have been acting very strange the last few weeks.
Of course it was Damone. If it was Ron Johnson, you'd be out to here!
I paid for it and everything.
Don't do anything, Linda. I'd rather just forget about it. I don't even like the guy.
I want romance.
Where's Doug?
Dartmouth?!
I can't believe it! But what about Doug?
Yeah. I'm registered for this class.
This is U.S. History, right? I saw the globe in the window.
Can I come in?
Mr. Spicoli?
You just ripped my card in two!
I don't know, mon. The food lines took forever.
Now, Mr. Spicoli, comes a rare moment for me. Now I have the unique pleasure of squaring our account. Tonight, you and I are going to talk in great detail about the Davis Agreement, all the associated treaties, and the American Revolution in particular. Now if you can just turn to Chapter 47 of Lord of Truth And Liberty.
Aloha, Mr. Hand!
You look like you could still be in high school.
'The Cuer-vo Gold, the fi-ine Columbian.'  You look nice tonight.
Where do you feel like going?
Are you really nineteen?
I think I better take you home.
You keep them.
What's your other question?
Do you mind if I excuse myself for a moment?
Sure. I'll... have another Coke.
I had a really nice time tonight.
So... pretty nice house you've got here.
What about the notes?
Really?
Anything to drink?
Let's have lunch!
The woman who left that message for you sounded very disturbed. I think she was crying...
Well, certainly... We're always happy to cooperate with the police...
What? Ah... yes, yes, I see what you mean... Yes... so, you'll be responsible then?
They're everywhere. Nobody's safe. And sure as hell not in the South. They like warm weather... You'd never believe it. In L.A. it's out of control. First it was drugs, now it's witchcraft.
We know where he lives, but we can't get near the house.
What do you mean by that?
Where ya comin' from, young man?
A great town, that Vegas. I bet you had good luck there. You're the type.
If so -- well, we'll just have to cut his head off and bury him somewhere. Because it goes without saying that we can't turn him loose. He'd report us at once to some kind of outback Nazi law enforcement agency, and they'll run us down like dogs...
I tell you, my man. This is the American Dream in action! We'd be fools not to ride this strange torpedo all the way to the end.
He said he understood, but I could see in his eyes that he didn't. He was lying to me.
That's the press table. Where you have to sign in for our credentials. Shit, let's get it over with. You handle that, and I'll check on the room.
Total control now. Tooling along the main drag on a Saturday night in Vegas, two good old boys in a fire apple red convertible... stoned, ripped, twisted... Good people!
Some angry Rotarian shoves you and you think: What's happening here? What's going on? Then you hear yourself mumbling.
I want to leave fast.
Did you see that? Some sonofabitch kicked me in the back.
What limes?
Have you made a deal with him? Did you put him on to her?
You're doomed. I'm leaving here in two hours and then they're going to come up here and beat the mortal shit out of you with big saps. Right there in that tub.
Jesus.
NO! Stop talking like that.
The only alternative was to take her out to the desert and feed her remains to the lizards. But, it seemed a bit heavy for the thing we were trying to protect: My attorney.
Hell, in Malibu alone, these goddamn Satan worshippers kill six or eight people every day. All they want is the blood. They'll take people right off the street if they have to.
Like big lizards.
What's wrong with you? Hell, somebody has to do it.
Good work.  They'll treat us like goddamn lepers after that.
OK, goddamnit!... Look... I'll call her. I'll get her off our backs. You're right. She's my problem.
Adrenochrome...
Never mind, it's absolutely pure.
Man, your head would swell up like a watermelon, you'd probably gain about a hundred pounds in two hours...
...grow claws... bleeding warts.
What are you doing? You were supposed to turn back there!
Please... please... I'm only the maid. I didn't mean nothin!...
Maybe she's telling the truth. Maybe she's not part of it.
The password is: "One Hand Washes The Other." The minute you hear that, you say "I fear nothing."
What?
YOU'RE KILLING HIM!
You can't keep me here. This is bullshit. Fuckin' bullshit. This is fucking BULLSHIT!
I will not die because of him!
IS IT CLEAR?!
Stop it.
We shot a skunk.
Hey! Get quiet or get out.
I think I know where a CB is.
We'll be food, dickheads!
That's the oldest of the bunch, looked like the Grandpapa. We caught the little one, Junior, in the cooler there. As we've seen, what he lacks in size he more than makes up for in speed.
So, your husband ditched you?
I'm gonna shoot him if they don't get him first.
I'd love to be macho, but this is a pants wetter from all angles.
Do you drive a short beer bus or something? You go out there you get eaten, you stay in here you get eaten, anyone comes to help they get eaten. Don't you see a pattern here, Spuds Makenzie?
Come on!
What now, Geronimo?
It's imperative that you get that truck moving.
Will I go crazy or something?
Wait, before you do that, help me to the kitchen, I need to lay down. There's a cot back there.
It's much safer in there, sweety.
How much you got to see the show?
What do you mean what?
Open?
How many?
Max?
Keys.
Let me make this clear; if we stay, we die!
This one will just stun ya, but this one will put ya to sleep.
You young'uns worry about weapons, I'm thinkin' bout strategy.
Sit still, look less like a meal.
Clever fuckers.
Got 'cha!
NO, but I will lock you in.
SHIT.
Do we have anything else to defend ourselves with? Anything?
If you are face to face with her, dive left.
Hold it!
You know you don't have to do this.
I know. Thanks. Just don't tell anyone I have a soft side.
What have you done now, broke the darn thing?
Come on, it's just what you need! Let everyone see you. Talk to them, live it up!
Come on, she's an important columnist! What's the matter? I thought you wanted these people to forgive you.
That's Frances. I'm not the cookbook.
Madam...?
The Group is more than a theatre company. It's the embodiment of an ideal. Our approach allows the actor to be an artist in the fullest sense, a creative individual and an instrument of change. You see --
Without me.
I don't suppose it occurred to you that I might want to leave too, that I might want to do theatre? No, 'cause you don't want me along, do you? And the reason has nothing to do with summer stock.
Harry!
...Don't you?
...I see.
...until finally your mother finds it necessary to commit you to a state mental institution. Were you mentally ill, Frances?
Yeah... well... it's possible. Harry York and I both work for Mr. Kaminski right now, and... well... There are lots of folks in this country who never got a square break. That's the way of things, but Mr. Kaminski wants to change it, and when it comes to new ideas, the people in power get nervous.
Dad, please, don't leave early. Just because of Mama --
What do I do, Dad?
I love you, Mama.  I love you, Dad.
...So what do you think?
I know that, Dad, but --
I'm sorry, I... I don't have a desk in my room, and... 
How? What do they do for you, Kaminski and his friends? They're all anarchists! Traitors!
I'm going back to the hotel.
But, Kurt, I...
Is it true you're getting a divorce? Comrade?
Just one minute...
Yeah. Well if you didn't put it in the papers -- nobody'd even know about it.
You know, my Dad's done some work for Kaminski...
Whattaya mean?
I suppose not. Gotta ask you this, though: for all our sakes, you better keep your trap shut.
You know, my old man was an inventor. Spent his whole life down in the basement trying to design transcontinental underground railroads, stuff like that. Well, I was supposed to be his partner. When I told him the smell of his workshop made me sick, I thought he was going to die right there.
Yeah, I read about that. Terrible business, suicide.
Oh no...
Not bad. It was slow at first, but I'm doing bits now.
Serious, huh?
You're telling me.
What're you gonna do, waste your talent? Why not use it to make something worthwhile. You can do that, you know?
I'm serious, Frances. This is important.
I called your god-damned office! I want you to kill him, Harry. You'll do that for me, won't you? I loved him, I loved him... that bastard.
How the hell do you find me anyway?
What for?
Take a walk, pal.
You should stickaround sometimes. Look out for me.
Frances! Frances!
You don't need to screw around anymore. You don't need Dwayne Steele or Odets or your mother. You need me.
I don't know.
How... how ya doin', Farmer?
Where you goin'?
Yeah, I know what that's like... Where you been?
Yeah.
What happened? Who're you?
I live here.
And what's the title of this seduc... assault?
That's me, Clifford.
But I want to. I'm trying!
'But how do I know you love me?'
I don't care.
Nothing. I think I'll just go out for awhile.
How long will you be?
You know, the surest way to lose an appetite, is to drink, little sister.
No!
You're not going anywhere!
Of course, she hasn't anything definite in mind.
No... What I mean is... I'm just very excited by the prospect of getting on with my life, that's all.
I'm sorry. She misunderstood, that's all.
I'm sure you'll see it my way in the end.
Symington says...
Is it radical for the wealth of this country to be turned back to the people who built the country?
Yeah, well, you know doctors. They sure hate to use that word.
You were with him at the end.
Why?
Your crime... as well as mine.
Friend?
What is this?
GET AWAY FROM HER! SHE'S MINE!
You dance so beautifully together.
I should go. I should leave today.
And not a word of them to Father. He's agitated enough not hearing from Victor.
Claude rode over there to see if held lost track of time. They say he never arrived.
Oh, do give him here! He needs to be comforted and held!
Brother and sister still?
I wish to be your wife.
We need each other now, I need your comfort and strength, not separation and solitude.
No. Not tomorrow, not next week, Marry me today.
I'm convinced. Not by treating symptoms, but by diving nature's most jealously-guarded secrets.
I was just clearing my throat.
The entire school heard it. It wasn't something one could miss.
What now? Writing about it in your journal won't help.
...yes, and thanks to him, smallpox has been virtually eliminated. I've heard this speech before.
And here's to Him. Everything in moderation, Frankenstein.
That's blasphemy!
We feared cholera. Turned out to be pneumonia, brought on by nervous exhaustion and some idiot running around in a storm.
Mine and Professor Krempe's.  We've been trading off nursing you in shifts. The rest of the time we're out working with the cholera victims. It's his turn for that just now.
To say the least. I came here to expand my mind, but honest inquiry seems strangled at every turn. All we do is cling to the old knowledge instead of seeking the new.
"...a sincere and heartfelt apology which you will then read aloud to him before the assembled student body and faculty.
Good night, Alice.
Cabin B is ready.
That's got her. Thanks. I'm Steve Christy. Welcome to Camp Crystal Lake. You got some grubby clothes? Climb into 'em. Alice, see if Bill has cleaned out the boathouse. I want him to start with the canoes. What happened to Brenda?
Oh, my God...
And it's this place. It makes no sense, but it spooks me.
Filmmaker.
Trouble?
Jack and Marcie are gonna be drenched.
Why don't we run? Just run now?
I'm sorry.
What hath God wrought?
Ha!
Ow!
Steve taught me how to use the emergency generator. The town power lines are supposed to be real shitty.
How about our last jay?
Just a walk, for Chrissakes.
What about Neddy?
He keeps on acting like such an asshole!
It's beautiful...
Cowboy.
Anything else you want?
How much do I owe you?
Yeah. I got it on before this --  -- all started.
I told you not to buy that hunk of junk!
What is your purpose in Mexico?
I don't know, one place's as good as another.
We got about two more hours of day light left. That'll get us into El Paso, which is right next to the border. We'll stop at a motel --
Why do you want to stop?
Son, I have this situation under control. I know exactly what I'm doing. You're going to have to trust me on this.
You don't believe in suicide.
Oh, well, excuse me all to hell.
It's okay, honey. Everything's going to be all right.
Where are the keys to the motor home?
Who's this?
Come on, gimme some more details. How'd it happen? Some fuckin' drunk kill her?
Died instantly?
I've seen one of these before. A friend of mine had himself declared a minister of his own religion. Away to fuck the IRS. Is that what you're doing, or are you the real McCoy?
I thought so. You help us get across the border without incident, stay with us the rest of the night without trying anything funny, and in the morning we'll let you and your family go. That way everybody gets what they want. You and your kids get out of this alive and we get into Mexico. Everybody's happy.
Jesus Christ, Pops, don't start with this shit.
Didn't like it, did ya?
Didn't think so. So, as I was saying, I'm willing to make a deal. You behave, get us into Mexico, and don't try to escape. I'll keep my brother off your daughter and let you all loose in the morning.
We did our part, we gotcha in Mexico. Now it's time for your part, letting us go.
Why are you so agitated?
He backed down.
What did you call me?
You all are gonna fuckin' die! I'm gonna fuckin' kill every last one of you godless pieces of shit!
That happens, you'll get it back.
What do you think Mom would say?
There's nothing wrong with this place.
Kate, we don't have all day, so I'm only gonna count to five. One...two... three... four...
I'm going for 'em!
Watch my back!
How many bullets left, kid?
Should I use the last bullets on us?
I'm sorry.
What the hell would I do with that grease pit? Besides, Nadine's got enough of a cross to bear just taking care of that potato head. Then all this Abilene shit happened. You heard about that bank robbery in Abilene, didn't ya?
They'll probably make a run for the border, which would bring 'em this way. And if we get our hands on those shit asses, we're talking payback time. We'll get 'em all right. I gotta piss. I'm gonna use your commode.
What do you want from me? I did what you said.
Were you giving that pig signals?
He says you were scratching.
I never said help us!
Richie? You okay?
What did I tell you? What did I tell you? Buy the road map and leave.
Do they have an X-rated channel?
Richard!
They're gonna search the van.
What does that mean?
You just called me a fuckin' nut.
You okay?
Yeah, we were just standing there. You said something about your shoulder hurting, then you just hit the ground like a sack of potatoes.
Yeah, when you fell your head smacked the toilet hard. It scared the shit outta me. Sure you're okay?
I'm here with you.
My shit is together.
B.O.Q., south side.  Take a starboard tack out the door.
Awright.  How's our girl doin', anyway?
So.  We're still coming to terms with the exact protocol for this -- for integrating the Spec-Recon training.  It may not always be smooth, but we're trying to make it as painless as possible for you.
Barber was my next stop, sir. Would've had it regulation sooner, only --
Really, I have no problem with --
All right, lieutenant, give me a name and specifics, I'll have the X.O. file an action first thing in the morning.  A name?
What I resent, lieutenant, is some politician using my base as a test tube for her grand social experiment.  What I resent is the sensitivity training that is now mandatory for my men... the day-care center I have to build where an officer's lounge used to be... and the OB/GYN I have to keep on staff just so someone can keep track of your personal pap smears.  But most of all, lieutenant, I resent your perfume, however subtle it may be, competing with the aroma of my fine three-dollar-and-fifty- nine cent cigar, which I will happily put out this very instant if the phallic nature of it happens to offend your goddamn fragile sensibilities.  DOES IT?
Then good night.
Sir, please... if there's any way to do this without dragging everyone through the mud...
Well, if you had to go over my head, lieutenant, that's the way to do it.  Christ, nothin' like a 0-200 call from the Commander and Chief to get the bowels movin'.
Shit.  Think we're had.
Think I overplayed it?
... last few years have brought many advances in the interests of women in naval service, particularly in the land-based maritime specialties. What's more, the Navy has instituted special sensitivity courses with an eye on --
The commission concluded that the aviator in question failed to execute a proper approach to the carrier.
Jordan.  I always hoped we'd get together -- though just now I'm gearing up for a child-care vote that --
It should.  You nominated him for Spec-Recon just three days after you nominated me.
Wickwire was there to help.  To be my eyes on the inside, to make sure you were getting a fair shot.  At least that was the intent.
So?  Isn't the President jumping on your bandwagon?
You don't know that.
I've had no direct communication with him since this whole thing began.  And that's quite verifiable.
Well, Flea, I appreciate the respect you just showed me.  But I don't need it and don't want it -- not that kind of respect, anyway.  It's just gonna hurt us both, okay?
Don't have to use it, O'Neil, but it's gotta go out.  Five... four... three...
Come on, Montgomery...
Miller.  Thought the guy was made of depleted uranium.  Really didn't expect to lose him.
She's an officer.  There's a higher standard.
Of course it is.  And I'm gonna stay on her until everyone realizes this is not some bullshit equal-rights thing, that real lives are gonna be lost.  Maybe mine, maybe yours.
Automatic five-second deduction, which slips you under the wire. It's called "gender-norming," O'Neil -- standard procedure for all females in physical training courses.  Where you been the last few years?
The Navy Cross...
Lieutenant O'Neil.
You expect the extraction team to ride the sub bare-back?  Is that correct, O'Neil?
That bad?
Still can't make up your mind, huh? Gotta go, Royce.
Instructors typically pull three year assignments.  This guy's in and out in one year -- your year.  That sound right?
"In Washington..."
You really came back for more?  Of this?
If not, firing will only give away our position to hostiles in the area.  Now how smart is that?
32 feet, six inches!
Chief, sir, I don't understand why --
Why didn't you shoot the woman, O'Neil?
The others already told me, O'Neil. They wanted to shoot, but you wouldn't let them.  Because you went soft on another women --
I'm not the one who got five good men thrown in a bamboo cage.  You wear the bars, you made the call, and you got your whole crew --
Didn't you know you'd be raped if you were captured?  Didn't you even think about that?
Clear.
We're fucked.
Congress cuts, military bleeds.  But Pentagon's a big place.  Let's narrow the sights.
The White House.  If Jordan wins, DeHaven wins in spades.  Why?  Well, it's been said that the only man the President fears -- ain't no man.
Don't for a second think she didn't leak this story.  "G.I. Jane" gives DeHaven a symbol that taps into the biggest constituency of them all.
That's cuz I'm married to you.
I'm telling you he's dirt. He's a douche bag, gutter slime, dog crap, puke chunks...
Audrey's going to stay with us tonight.
I like that image.
Great stuff, Animal. Weren't you scared?
My God. He's going after the nest.
What are you doing?
Cut uptown, take 8th to 57th then cut up Broadway.
Audrey, did you take the tape out of the camera?
Audrey?! Is that you? Hi, hello. You look, wow, uh, how've you been?
So you made it.
I still can't believe it. How does a guy go from an anti-nuke activists to working for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission?
And you think this creature is one of them?
Blood sample? How close did you get to that thing?
I didn't mean for it to turn out like this.  Look, I lied to you. I'm not a reporter. When we broke up and I came out to New York I was so sure I'd make it. But I haven't. That's why I needed this story so bad. I just couldn't tell you I'm a failure.
And I'm supposed to remind you to call him on all of Caiman's expense p.o.'s.
Four years. Girl, I'm surprised he didn't ask you to marry him.
The warm feeling of helping your fellow man.
Just tell me, did you talk with him?
Mr. Caiman...
I've got something on this. I know a guy on the inside with the military...
You don't understand, I can get us information...
We did it! We've got the exclusive! Way to go, Audrey!
Three years digging up worms in Chernobyl? How did Mrs. Tatopoulos handle it?
Not for a long time, now.
They didn't make it.
Only five, Sir. We've checked them all. He hasn't used any of them.
Right. The worm guy.  Can someone get those people off the beach?
Somebody must have seen it.
You gave them the tape?
We think there's a strong reason to believe it may be hiding inside one of the buildings within the sequestered area.
General Anderson, the problem was the terrain. If we lure him out into a more open area such as this portion of Central Park...  We should be able to take him down.
SDECE, Service de Documentation Exterieure et de Contre-Espionnage. Agent Phillip Raymond.
We know.
Here. 23rd street subway station. Where we first found the fish. With a little luck, this will lead us right to it.
What's with the chewing gum?
Dr. Lazarus, here is your surface mapper.  I have programed it to the coordinates of a Beryllium Sphere of sufficient density.
Sir, it's you  Thank Ipthar!
"The show must go on."
I'm glad you asked... To me the most important qualities of a Galaxy Explorer are loyalty...
At ease men.
It's a DAMN ROCK MONSTER!!! It doesn't HAVE motivation!
Not again...
Settle down, Alex...
This is ludicrous.  Why are you listening to this man?  Must I remind you that he is wearing a costume, not a uniform?...  He's no more equipped to lead us than THIS fellow.  No offense.
He's a miserable twit!
A boy comes to the door.
WE'VE HAVE TO STOP!
"Go into the cloud! ...
He knocked me out the sonofabitch. Where is he?
What do you mean?
Commander, you and Lt. Madison will have to go through the crushers one at a time in three second intervals. Tell me when the first crusher hits the bottom...
That's It?
Structural damage at 68 percent.
Where are the miners?
Oh, they're so cute.
That's it, that's what's going to kill me.
It doesn't have to be a hologram... Just a diversion.
What?
Who we are. Don't you think they're going to be PISSED?
We're going to fire everything we've got at him, all right?
Maybe we can lose them in that cloud.
All right... here's the plan:  First, Fred, we need a diversion to clear those things out of the compound, then Gwen, Alex, Fred and I go down to get the sphere.  Any of those things come back, give a signal. Guy, you set up a perimeter.
Jason.. Can you hear me?
We shouldn't have to DO this!  It makes NO LOGICAL SENSE! Why is it HERE?
Where the hell is he?  An hour and a half late.  An hour and a half!
Oh my god! Tommy! Stop the pod! Stop the pod!
First, I require the Omega 13... Second-
Yes... Hi Sarris... How are you doing?
We.. We lie.
Commander, I must speak to you. It is a matter of supreme importance... We are Thermians from the Klatu Nebula, and we require your help. I beseech you to come with us, back to our ship. A great many lives hang in the balance...
Commander?... Where are you... going?
You... You mean Earth?
But what if Sarris survives?
An interstellar vox.
To our brave guests.  Few in this universe have the opportunity to meet their heroes.  We are blessed to count ourselves among them.
A model, only as big as this.
... to make sure craft service keeps those little butter cookies, and plenty of them-
That's right... Just keep shaking it out... Here, have some gum, It helps.
Where?
Okay... On what?
Go for the eyes. Like in episode 22 with-
Pedal to the metal Tommy...
Well, now there's something worth dying for.  What do you think?
Arnold!
Go on... I want to hear everything.
What do you think, George, shall I resign?  It's what they want.
Then, I need you.  We all do. Without your victory the men would have no hope at all.
That scum Joseph Reed... they're calling him the 'King of Pennsylvania'.  The man's a budding Cromwell.  He condemns rich Tories to death and then 'appropriates' their property for himself. Naturally, the pig hates me for every Tory I've saved.
You, you just need a new flint, General.
What?  What are you talking about?
We've got powder but no ball!
How old are you, Captain?
They're among the best divisions the British have.  No conscripts, no impressed recruits, just professional killers.
General Greene is here.  There are two other divisions here.
Yessir.
This is a declaration of insurrection!  Who wrote this!?
What's your advice, Alexander?
Who the hell knows?  Everyone's giving orders.  It's all very democratic.
No one wants another failure right now, God knows.  But people like Arnold and, God knows, I'm having my fears about General Washington.
Partially...
Unofficially, General Greene.
Colonel Reed...
That damned Arnold is here, isn't he?  Did you know he lost all his ships?  Outrageous and completely unacceptable.
George, I'm afraid if you go through with this madness I must tender my resignation as your aide. I see where we're headed, you're putting your trust in the likes of Hamilton and Arnold...
And, Hamilton?  Greene?
What is it, Marquis?
Well, a very real expectation is the British will hang you!  They'll burn Mount Vernon and they'll hang you!  Our marriage is a business just as surely as...
It's an anti-Christian dogma!  I cannot believe you are so calm about it!
Is that why you come in here tossing pennies to my starving men? It's damned condescending!
They're finished, they can't help us anymore!  They've done their duty, General Greene, now you do yours!
I... I'm possessed of the idea of a command in your army, sir.
The only way to get discipline into these men is to beat it into them! Fifty lashes each!
Nathanael, I'm sending you to Virginia to head the southern army, to harass Cornwallis.  Marquis, you must go with him.
And what is this, then?  Been off to fight the French because you are a patriot?  Or is this you, gaining your long sought after rise in society by becoming victorious in war!?
Now that is a lie!  See how much you want to create a scandal in exchange for a glowing reputation and polite society laid at your feet!  When you break off your engagement to Martha Curtis, I'll divorce William!  Do you hear?  You get what you want from this world, then throw it all away on love!
You remember, George, when we were 'studying' the great philosophers?
Capture them?  Well, I've never seen anything like it, so... of course I'm curious.
Cranes?  Who needs to walk like a crane?
What are you doing?
I've been surprised in an unguarded hour, But must not now go back; the love that lay, Half smothered in my breast, has broke through all, Its weak restraints, and burns in its full lustre.  I cannot, if I would, conceal it from thee.
All people have rights!
Is that your test of patriotism, George; if a man will die for you?
What is this?
Doesn't matter what it's called, Harry's got Martin Weir and it's gonna be big.
Listen, tonight, later on, I got one for you doesn't involve any heavy work. I want you to go have a look around Chili Palmer's hotel room.
Who?
I heard in the Federal joints they let you spend an extra five minutes at the glass with your Daddy on Father's Day.
And if we don't happen to find it under Palmer's mattress or inside Karen Flores' undie drawer? What then?
Trade for what?
About sixty.
You gave him the money?
He's around someplace.
Says here you're getting Martin Weir for the part of Lovejoy.
I wonder, would that work?  You know who I see for Al Roxy? Harvey Keitel. The man could do it in his sleep.
Title's the first thing's got to go. And the guy's name. I mean, even this writer's name, Murray Saffrin is better than "Lovejoy".
Where's Karen?
I'm working on a few things.
How 'bout another one for Mr. Zimm. A double.
He was watching Letterman, huh? Sneaky, that Chili Palmer.  So, he ever find this dry cleaner, the one with all that money on him?
Assuming I go along with this, when can I have the five hundred?
Hello? You there?
I work for Harry Zimm, alright?
Look, there's no reason you and I shouldn't get along. Forget all the bullshit from before -- I don't even remember how it started. You took a swing at me over some fuckin' thing, whatever it was -- forget it. You owe me some money, right? Forget that too. But, you don't say a fuckin' word about this to anybody. It's strictly between you and me, right?
You live in Miami?
Anyway, you want this guy, he's in L.A. We put him on a flight after he spanked one a my cocktail girls in the Keno room.
Guy owes us a hundred and fifty grand, sixty days over; a movie producer.
I'm looking at you.
You're not looking at me, Harry.
You want to hear this idea? It's about a dry cleaner who scams an airline out of three hundred grand. Go on, tell her.
I imagine in your line of work, there were times you had to get rough, you know, say one of your customers stopped paying.
Ever shot anybody.
What's it called?
Lovejoy sits behind the wheel, watching the bar across the street, getting his video camera ready for action...  What's he doing? Following a guy?
I had to tell 'em something.
Really.
So how 'bout it, Mr. Selznick, do I make my deal with Bo? Or you gonna finally help me out, have a word with your dry cleaner when you find him.
You cut straight hair in this place, or just fags?
Well, you had it down cold. Watching you in the movie, if I didn't know better I'd have to believe you were a made guy and not acting. Even the fink part. I never met a fink and I hope to God I never do, but how you did it must be the way finks act.
So you don't know what I'm thinking.
That's what I think of you, asshole. Nothing.
Very nice...
What's that?
Now you're down to three-ten in the case. You must've cooled off quite a bit since you got here.
It's all mine.
It's not one of these?
Mr. Barboni is a good customer.  Works for Jimmy Capp.
No, it was open. It wasn't locked.
A couple days ago by, people from the airliner come to see his wife, tell her how sorry they are and all that their plane exploded and offer her a settlement, the amount based on what he would've earned operating the dry cleaner's the rest of his life. Leo had some kind of trouble with his kidneys, so they were giving him about ten years.
I wanted to come by, apologize for coming into your house like I did last night.
I know I'm better than what I've been doing the last ten years, walking around in a tank top and fuck-me pumps, waiting till it's time to scream.
How come you stopped making movies with Harry?
You read Harry's new one? He says it's the best thing he's ever read.
Tell you what, I'll stop by Harry's office and pick up a copy for you.
Well, I gotta have a talk with Leo, my runaway dry cleaner.
That was Martin. He wants to have lunch tomorrow. That is, if you can make it.
How'd you meet Martin anyway?
Oh, I like him. I just think he's... short. I mean, he's a good actor and all, but I'm wondering what it was exactly you saw in Marty.
So what about your story. You thought of a title yet?
I think you could be an actor. I know you're acting sometimes, but you don't show it.
You don't mean a movie star? More like a character actor?
I mean I could see myself in movies Robert De Niro had been in. Or I could maybe do an Al Pacino movie, play a hard-on. But I couldn't see myself in ones, like say the one where the three guys get stuck with a baby. They don't know how to take care of it and you see these big grown-up assholes acting cute --
It's not Dave. It's a movie.
I don't know.
You okay?
You don't act like it?
Hey, Chili.  Get your coat, but don't piss the guy off, okay? It could get complicated and we'd have to call Momo to straighten it out. Then Momo gets pissed for wasting his time and we don't need that.
He already knew it.
All these camera moves and weird angles and shit are gonna distance us from the emotion of the scene.
Yeah? What three words, Harry?
So this means you've reconsidered our deal on Mr. Lovejoy?
When I came upstairs, you stayed to finish your drink. I told you to turn off the TV when you were through.  Come to think of it, I also told you you could sleep in the maid's room.
With your experience, you could always become an agent. Right, Harry?
Well. I got an audition tomorrow.
I'm sitting here, I'm looking at you and I'm having these flashes. You know, flashbacks, of memories.  Of us.
Oh, for Christ's sake --
I have to consider, I mean, as the mob guy, this is another man's wife I'm sleeping with.
Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. What type of vessel?
North Island, please repeat? Over.
Yeah, but not as cold as those Swedish girls you only gonna dream about.
Where's his boat, then? Where's his crew? He ain't gonna be out here by himself, that's for damn sure.
I need lag bolts, especially one inch standard. And sheet metal. Preferably steel, about a sixteenth of an inch. Aluminium, even tin'll do.
When they find out what it's carrying, they may not be so interested in what's legal.
The turbine blew.
Where from?
Maureen.
Ready?
Nobody just scuttles a passenger liner either.
Last thing we want is extra partners.
This's gonna hurt a little.
Maybe that is his boat.
Fifty million dollars. Fifty million. We gonna let this guy just take it from us? One guy?
I'm no doctor. But I'd say he's in a coma.
It's a bloody navigation hazard. One boat can't control a ship that size.
With a little extra fuel, weather permitting, we should make Sitka in five days without another stop.
The number one turbine's pretty well trashed. Number two runs, but it's way underpowered.
I thought you said it was just a blade.
But how long?
What about running number two by itself?
Goddamit, Dodge.
Obviously it's some kind of screw up. The shipping records aren't a hundred percent accurate.
Or somebody stopped them.
I say fuck the motherfucker. We're a professional salvage crew going about our business. What's some yahoo doing way out here by himself anyway?
If he's reasonable, maybe we can make some kind of deal. If not. We'll have to re-consider our options.
That'd be my guess.
It was a man's voice. Repeating some sort of children's rhyme. I don't know, it didn't make any sense. You didn't hear it?
Well, they're gonna be asking a lot of questions. About us. About those bodies. About the gold. Seems like we oughta be prepared is all.
The radio!
Yeah.
Don't fall asleep.
Could be a fishing boat.
That's a good thing?
Stay away. Or else.
I don't even want to know what that's gonna taste like now.
I can't believe you. Dodge's dead and all you can think about is cashing in your share.
Go on.
Ever heard of the Mary Celeste?
What guy?
You sure it wasn't me?
What do you think happened on this boat?
And now you're gonna kill me, is that it?
Murphy, don't you see what's happening?
I been watching it for close to an hour and it hasn't moved. I can't raise it on the radio either. Makes me think it might be in trouble.
Murphy, goddamit.
Whatever the reason, she's adrift and abandoned. We've got every right to salvage her.
All we got to do is hit some rough weather and you can forget about it.
Fifty million four ways. That's twelve million and change a piece.  What you gonna do with your share, skipper?
Greer?
Oh, man.
He took the shotgun and a light.
You're kidding, right?
I-I honestly never intended for this to happen...
And what was your reason for choosing him as your subject?
These are all valid comments, but I think we should see if the artist has anything to bring to this.
Did you actually do this painting?
Don't worry - it's nothing bad. I was just wondering what your plans were for next year?
Hmm.
Look, that's the policy... if you want to make up your own rules you can open your own theater...
What can you tell me, young man, about the various flavors of "frozen yogurt"?
That guy rules!
So, where's "Weird Al"?
That's not him... Jesus, stop freaking me out.
Hi Josh.
Hi... what's up?
Do you want something to drink?
What do you mean "why"?
You must have known all along how I -- you know -- how I felt about you -- it must be totally obvious...  God... I always used to dream about this...
Remember that stupid hippie art teacher who failed me sophomore year? I didn't think that just because you get an "F" that means you have to take the class over again.
This is so bad, it's almost good.
Did you sign up yet?
God, it's so weird that we're finally out of high school... We've been waiting for this our whole life! Now we can get our own apartment and do anything we want.  It's such a weird feeling.
Much later.
Hi, Al!
I might actually get the pasta special.
God, I think Josh is too mature for us.
I want to "make love" to him.
Are you sure?
He's insane!
Ew, look at this...
He should totally just kill himself... Hey, here's one  ...Oh wait...  you have to share it with a non smoking feminist and her two cats...
We still have to go in there sometime.
Where are we going?
How about this one?
I'll be right back, I'm gonna go get a beer.
But those are our people...
I'm working on it... I've got a few leads... it's just that right now I have, all these projects that take up all my time.
...you don't have to make a million dollars -- just get any stupid job so we can at least start looking for an apartment.
He gives me a total boner!
Anyway, now we can start looking for the apartment...  Do you remember when we first came up with that whole idea of renting our own apartment?
What are you talking about? What kind of loser gets fired after one day?!
If it makes you feel any better, I don't think you could've gotten more than ten bucks for all this stuff.
I am not -- I just think it'd be funny to see what he'd do...
What happened to Seymour?
How repulsive!
Why? What did he say?
When was this?
There.
I dunno...
Wow... finally.
Oh my god, what are you guys doing here?
I want to know what you think you're doing, staying out all night and worrying your father to death!
A what?
How much is this?
Do you have any other old records besides these?
I'm thinkin' maybe I could let it go...
Go die, asshole!
Five hundred.
I was wearing that dress the day I lost my virginity.
Is this one any good?
Yeah, it took a while before I got a chance to play it, but when I heard that song it was like --
Wow! This is like my dream room! Are these all records!
No you're not! You're a cool guy, Seymour.
Mark my words, by the end of this summer you'll be up to your neck in pussy!
Okay, what about this one? Are you into girls with big tits?
I really don't think it's a good idea.
Wow! Look at all these creeps!
So, why did you bring this along?
What are we, in slow motion here?! What are ya, hypnotized? Have some more kids, why don't you?... For Christ's sake, would you move!?
We just need to figure out a place where you can meet somebody who isn't a total idiot, that's all.
Yeah, well, I can't relate to humanity either, but I don't think it's totally hopeless...
I'm not sure I have anything to drink... there might be some --
Nothing so glamorous... actually, I'm an assistant manager at their corporate headquarters.
You can open your eyes now.
Arrrghhh! Ah Jeez... Christ...
Never...
Actually, I've got a total crush on this one guy right now, but it's a really fucked-up situation...
Never mind, it's way too complicated...  Did you have problems like this when you were my age - where you're totally confused all the time?
Seymour! I promise you that wasn't a joke -- you have to call her back!
Yeah, so I better go -- it's not really the best time to talk...
No, actually Joe told me you were here... so how come you never call me anymore?
Yeah, I'll bet! So, how's it going with what's-her-name? Dana?
Well, you know... what do I know about clothes... I've never been the most fashionable guy -- it's nice to have someone do all the work for me...
No, no... not exactly... she just doesn't understand how I would know somebody like you...
No, of course not.
...What do you mean?
You need a bigger place - this is like a little kid's room.
Where did you get this?
You know what my number one fantasy used to be?
What do you want?
God, Dana's going to kill you!
So what's the story with the two cheerleaders over here?
I think that Phillip and Enid can help us to see that there are-many different ways we can express ourselves.  We can do things like these cartoons that are amusing as a sort of light entertainment or we can do work that is more serious in scope and feeling and that deals with issues; emotional, spiritual, political; of great importance. I hope that you will each have the tools to do that type of work by the end of this class.  Who is responsible for this?
This shocking image of repressed femininity!
Uh... hi. Uh... Enid's stepmother told me I'd find her here?
No... they said she was here...
Maybe she's with Josh?
I don't know.
She just mentioned him a few times and said that they had been dating - I thought maybe she was...
What are you talking about?
Well, mostly archival research, cataloguing old records and writing liner notes for their CD reissues. It's really... I can't believe it.
Seymour?
You were contracted to work-
Most certainly. Absolutely. Yes.
Starting now, we attack them.
John Henry Patterson, come in. I'm Robert Beaumont.  Firm- I like that, tells me a lot about you-  -now why don't you tell me about me? To get you started, many people find me handsome, with a wonderful smile. I'm sure you agree.  Winning personality, heaps of charm?
Very moving, Patterson; I'm touched you confided in me.  But I don't really give a shit about your upcoming litter. I've made you with this assignment-  -don't make me break you.
Pleasant journey?
Awhile back he ordered some bibles-  -I've brought them.  Is he here?
And it worked?
What?
I know it's your first day and of course you must be tired from the journey-  -but what are you going to do about it?
I'm David Hawthorne, this is my hospital. And my advice to you is, "don't get sick in front of it."  That was meant to be charming, sorry. I seem to have lost the knack.
A man-eater attacks and you're such a buffoon you almost forget to mention it?
I tried to be late, John- it would have been easier if you'd gone.
We all have our reasons. Mine is simply to make them understand happiness, accept salvation, know the serenity that comes-  -best I stop. One of the by-products of my belief is that I can become amazingly boring. But I know God smiles on me.
How lucky we are.
In your honor, Nigel. And you and Singh will be in charge of building them- and you'll also build the roadbeds and the three foundation pillars- and you'll be finished in eight thrilling weeks.
Second death? Where?-
I didn't have a chance to thank you.
I don't really. But understand something- even though it may take me two or three days to sort this out-  -when I'm gone, you'll still have to build the bridge. And I don't want the men to have lost respect for you.
Samuel says you killed a lion.
Goddammit!
They're used to people in trees, not in a clearing.  It may be tight.
Did it look like this in your mind?
Nonsense.
Do you love her?
Why do you laugh?- you don't believe she taught me?
Do you need anything?  You want me to come in?
Many marriages begin with a certain amount of distance, but after a while I believe we could learn to love each other.  Think about it.
Hundreds of people.  Believe me, I didn't imagine this.
We'll do the happiness index next.  I'd like to bring Ray in on your case, if it's all right with you.
Hiya, Oscar.  What do you say, slugger?
Hello, Peter.
You mean you cough up hairballs all over the rug?
Or we could do that.
Are you all squeaky clean now?
They didn't find anything?  In the bathtub ... the pink ooze ... nothing?  So, what do I do now?
So -- are you making any New Year's resolutions?
Maybe I should call Janine.
That's not true.  It was 1620.
That's a terrible thing to say.
Is this the spot?
Sorry!
It may have been a room on the spacecraft made up to look like a room in the Holiday Inn.  I can't be sure, Peter.
You're really good with children, Louis.  I can tell.  Why don't you come here and sit with me?
You pitiful, miserable creatures!  You dare to challenge the power of darkness?  Don't you realize what you are dealing with?  He's Vigo!  You are like the buzzing of flies to him.
The season of evil begins with the birth of the new year.  Bring me the child that I might live again.
The witness is leading him.  Sustained.
Come on, Sherm.  You're my cousin.  Do this for me.  I'm begging you.
This year?  That's cutting it a little close, isn't it?  I mean, just from a sales point of view, the book just came out, right?  So you're not even looking at the paperback release for maybe a year.  And it's going to be at least another year after that if the thing has movie-of-the-week or mini-series potential. You would have been better off predicting 1992 or even '94 just to be safe.
I'll ask you again, Dr. Venkman.  Why were you digging the hole?  And please remember that you're under oath.
I'd like to have a stool specimen
You were supposed to help me with this.
"Vigo the Carpathian, born 1505, died 1610 --"
Boys, listen.  You're scaring the straights. Let's save this until tomorrow, okay?
It's working.  The positive GeV's are climbing.
Who was that?
The New York Pneumatic Railway.  It was an experimental subway system.  Fan-forced air-trains, built around 1870.
Hey, I didn't imagine it.  There must have been ten thousand gallons of it down there.
No, not exactly a man of the people.  "Also known as Vigo the Cruel, Vigo the Torturer, Vigo the Despised, and Vigo the Unholy."
Great.  So what are you guys working on?
I love this.  We're onto something really big.  I can smell it, Ray.  We're going to make some headlines with this one.
Like a goat on garbage.
I think we're going to have to pass on the sewer trip, boys.  Let me know what you find out.
Forget it.  The Vienna Boys Choir couldn't get through this stuff.
Vigi, Vigi, Vigi -- you have been a bad little monkey.
My great-grandparents were Swiss.  I still have the pictures they took of the statue from the boat when they arrived.
Does it have any favorites?
And he didn't die of old age either.  He was poisoned, stabbed, shot, hung, stretched, disemboweled, drawn and quartered.
You finished here?
Ray -- Ray -- How do you feel, man?
Aren't you glad we waited?
Is it a star?
Oh, Dana, it's you ...
Are you the Gatekeeper?
We're all professionals here, Miss ...
Is that your professional opinion?
You play the cello!  It's my favorite instrument.
I'd have to say Prokofiev's third concerto.
Like a used car salesman.
I'm a qualified psychologist.  I've got a degree and everything.  I believe that something happened here and I want to do something about it.
On a purely scientific basis.
Okay, okay.  But if anything else happens, you have to promise you'll call me.
Okay.  Then I'll go.
He is a very close friend.  Do you have some explanation of what happened in my apartment?
Hittites,  the Mesopotamians and the Sumerians.  "Zuul was the Minion of Gozer."
All right.  Since you put it that way.
We must prepare for the coming of Gozer.
That is one speedy mutt.
Egon, there's something very strange about that man.  I'm very psychic usually and right now I have this terrible feeling that something awful is going to happen to you.  I'm afraid you're going to die.
In the physical sense.
It's a souvenir from the 1964 World's Fair at Flushing Meadow.  It's my lucky coin.
I see.  And now you catch ghosts?
And how many ghosts have you caught, Mr. Venkman?
Well, just 75 more to go.  What's this one?
Hey!  I'm getting a little tired of this.
Yes?
What on earth gave you that idea?
Spengler, are you serious about actually catching a ghost?
Something was definitely here.
I'm with Dana Barrett and she's floating three feet off the bed.
Yeah, yeah.  I was just thinking.  It probably wouldn't be a good idea for them to get together at this point.
Where's the Keymaster?
Set entry grid.
I've got to sleep.
I told you it's real.
But most people are afraid to even report these things.
So do I.
I'm getting high readings near the air vents.  It must be using the duct system to get around.  See, I told you we'd get something.
Agile bastard, isn't he?
I couldn't help it!  It just popped in there!
Very impressive resume.  Electronic countermeasures, Strategic Air Command ... Black belt in Karate ... Small arms expert ... Mr. Zeddemore, as you may have heard, we locate ghosts and spirits, trap them with streams of concentrated quantum energy and remove them from people's homes, offices and places of worship.
Are you a Christian, Ray?
Quite so.  Narcissus and his courageous men; may they live long to serve Rome...
They hate me, they really hate me don't they?
Did Narcissus die today?  Wasn't this his day to die?
Tribuus... tomorrow.
You must start clearing everything with me -- especially your lovers.
I want that bastard dead!
Welcome back from your great triumph Narcissus Meridas.  My father sends his heart felt praise.  Sadly, Marcus is in dark humors -- nothing to worry about, but he needs rest. Likely just the weather.
It's because he comes off as the underdog.
Where is my father?
AGH!  Please!  He's having a secret device constructed for the circus. The brass craftsmen are working overtime.
So tell me, what happened between you and the emperor?  What really happened on the German front?  You know the Senate's arguing your case...
The Emperor and I are bound by the threads of The Fates.  He was born on August thirty-first, you know.
I believe we are arriving in an enlightened age; an age of peace that will bring Rome her greatest glory.  Thanks to Marcus Aurelius.
How did you get condemned to the arena without a trial?
I thought all good generals were quick to recognize opportunities.
Without him.  He'd be weeping if he overheard that.  Well?  The idea of you as my adopted brother is very... exciting.
He's very realistic.
This is our oil from our estates?
I want to come home, of course I do, I'd have to be mad not to want that. It's just that Marcus trusts me.
You're not going!  You have to stay with us!
Narcissus!
I'll never die.  You tell the girls that.  You honor our ancestors and I'll be there.  Every night.  At the table of life.
Condemned?  Aren't I owed a trial before being condemned?
Thank you.  What is going to happen tomorrow?  Exactly?
Proximo, if this is her doctor he's an assassin.
You put this inside your shirt -- when Tiger stabs your stomach -- it's full of pig's blood.  Gushes out everywhere!  It's really impressive.  Fantastic!  Better than the real thing!
The point is you get to fight the easy country circuit, the small arenas, relax, live the good life!
But -- you have to go out there! I'll give you more than your one third!  When I get paid... just take the fall!  You're too hurt to fight and the man's a killer!
Tell me honestly, since this may be our last earthly meeting:  if this were a fair fight where would you put your money?
How much money is involved?
They want to dump Tiger and have me endorse their damned chariot, right? They don't waste time...
Do you always drive like this?
Aren't you eating?
Why not?
I think I'd better go home now please.
Listen, Elaine -- it seems to me that there isn't a bar in here. I mean -- as far as I know.
Benjamin -- do they know you?
And it's all over now.
What's the matter?
You mean the one who --
Elaine --
Where are you meeting this person?
Is it because I'm here?
Well, I want you to leave.
She said she was having a drink in the hotel with a friend. You waited for her in the parking lot and told her she was too drunk to drive home and that you would get her a room for the night.
Please let me go.
I don't want you to go anywhere until you have a definite plan.
Benjamin?
We could go down and get our blood tests tomorrow.
Or this afternoon. It's a good day for it.
Why don't you just drag me off if you want to marry me so much?
Oh no. He said that.
Are we getting married tomorrow?
Ben!
Yes, I will.
I like to know who's living in my house. I like to know what my boys are up to.
Look -- I'll give you ten dollars for a dime -- I'll give you twenty -- for God's sake, will you let me use that phone?
Could I make one phone call first?
Well here's the purse.
I'd rather not.
Give me an hour.
Where is your luggage?
Very good, sir. I'll have a porter bring it in.
Benjamin, I want to ask you something.
You don't?
I want you to come in till I get the lights on.
Drink?
Did you know I was an alcoholic?
Mrs. Robinson, will you forgive me for what I just said?
Please forgive me. Because I like you. I don't think of you that way. But I'm mixed up.
Her portrait?
Yes?
Haven't you ever seen anybody in a slip before?
Benjamin?
Have you gotten us a room yet?
Why don't you get it.
I got a single room.
Well -- goodbye then --
To tell you?
Well.
You what?
Benjamin, is this your first time?
It is, isn't it? It is your first time.
Now -- do you think we could say a few words to each other first this time?
All we ever do is come up here and throw off the clothes and leap into bed together.
I'm not. No. But do you think we could liven it up with a few words now and then?
Can I take off my clothes now?
What?
We're talking.
Now let's keep going here.
Now. You say the driveway's on your side of the house. So I guess you don't sleep in the same room.
Oh no. Are you kidding me?
You have not slept with your husband for five years?
How many times a year.
What?
Oh no. You had to marry him because you got pregnant?
At college.
What kind of car was it?
A Ford! A Ford! Goddamnit, a Ford! That's great!
No.
I wish you'd tell me.
Well -- I guess I'll have to ask her out on a date and find out what's --
I'm good enough for you but I'm too slimy to associate with your daughter. That's it, isn't it? ISN'T IT?
That I'm a sick and disgusting person.
Did I say that?
Oh no.  Look -- I like you. I wouldn't keep coming here if I didn't like you.
Well I wouldn't. I would never say it if it wasn't true.
Look. Why the hell did you bring this up. It never occurred to me to take her out.
All right, for christ's sake. I promise I will never take out Elaine Robinson.
Now listen -- this was not my idea. It was my father's idea.
Drive down the block.
Hello. Get me the police, please.
Oh, no.
Well why do you -- why do you think that?
I'm not. But I'm -- I'm not very proud of what I do. I usually get kind of drunk. I usually drive over to Los Angeles and go to some bars and get kind of drunk. Then I take a hotel room. So I won't have to drive home on the freeway. I mean it kind of scares me to drive home after --
It's pretty embarrassing. I really don't know what to tell Mr. Robinson. It's awkward and strained for me every time he suggests that you call up Elaine.
Say that again.
She doesn't know that you're coming up to Berkeley?
Twenty. I'll be twenty-one next week.
Thank you.
In many ways I feel as though you were my own son.
Do you have a special grudge against me? Do you feel a particularly strong resentment for me?
Now look -- please --
No, I don't.
It shouldn't make any difference what happened.
Listen to me. We got -- we got into bed with each other. But it was nothing. It was nothing at all. We might -- we might just as well have been shaking hands.
The point is -- I don't love your wife. I love your daughter, sir.
HUH?
Can you see me now?
Is anything wrong?
It's a short life and a gay one...
I'm not going to get those pearls and neither are you.
I have an idea working in my head... 
He must be very nice.
Oh, my large and noisy neighbor -- really? That? 
You?
Reducing?
Poor child --  I wish I were free tonight -- we could --
Yes? -- Tomorrow?
You were very different yesterday.
That was lovely.
You're not a bit like you were yesterday.
Flaemmchen, what are you doing here in the middle of the night.
Well -- such is life, Flaemmchen.
Nothing -- only to be here.
But surely you must know -- because I love you.
Why do you look at me like that?
I think you must go now -- the key is on the floor.
The stage frays one's nerves... the discipline -- it's so exacting. Discipline means doing what you don't want to do and take no pleasure in doing. Do you know what I mean? Have you ever experienced the weariness that comes from discipline?
I see -- you do only what you take pleasure in doing. You take pleasure in coming into a woman's bedroom and you come. You take pleasure in a dangerous climb onto a balcony, so you do it... And what is your pleasure now?
No?
And what do you do -- now?
Oh! What a picture -- and what else?
You may keep the pearls -- I don't want them any more -- I'll make you a present of them.
But now, you must go... I give you the pearls. But now you must go ---
Do you understand?
Very early in the morning.
I'll give you what you need -- I have money.
Six twenty-seven in the morning... But the money?
You must go now. Be careful on your way to your room.
I'm worried about you.
On the train?
Baron, we must have gone a hundred miles an hour, at least...
What?
I've no luck.
Drink to me, Kringelein -- it's my last chance.
I take five hundred.
Here -- here it is. Here's your pocketbook, Kringelein.
Grusinskaya -- well, to tell the truth, Baron -- tonight we are a little bit nervous. Were you at the theatre last night?
Oh, let the poor devil alone.
Aha! -- The Baron. What do you want here?
So that's how we stand, Baron.
For me?
For me?
News? Yes -- killing in number one- sixty-four.
The big manufacturer killed Baron von Gaigern.
Life is changing you, Mr. Kringelein.
Oh, I've got to find it.
You may laugh. Caviar and champagne may mean nothing to you, but to me -- they mean a great deal. You see, I'm ill and all of a sudden I got a fear of missing life. I don't want to miss life -- do you understand?
I'm sure this beautiful room must appeal to your taste -- distinctive, don't you think? Velvet upholstery -- 'A-number one'. I'm in the textile trade and I know.  And these are real silk drapes.
Her master's voice!  I must go now -- goodbye -- thanks.
No - absinthe.
Dance then? 
You dance splendidly.
Of course I do -- I never knew what money really meant till I started spending it. Do you know --  I can hardly believe that anything so beautiful should come to me from Preysing -- I'll take care of you. Will -- will you let me?
Wherever you like. Here I'll give you the money I won, three thousand four hundred. Later you can have more.
When I -- I'm ill, Flaemmchen -- It will not be long -- I'll not last long. Will you stay with me until...
Do you like me better?
Moreover --
You're a very unusual stenographer --
You...
Skiing? 
How nice -- your daughters?
Now, children, no fighting -- save that for the office. Let's have our dance. 
Oh, yes, Mr. Preysing?
Can you pay some attention to me?
You're sweet.
Oh, no.
I'd like to wait for Justice Zinnowitz, before I commit myself.
Sorry, Preysing. 
Yes --
Goodbye, Preysing, I hope you pull through. This is a very bad time to be in such a crisis. We've...
Since, on the eleventh of June of this year -- when the first negotiations for a merger...
Here's my signature -- here Preysing, sign here.
Nine-thirty, Mr. Preysing keeps us waiting.
Always the performance -- every day the performance -- time for the performance.  I think, Suzette, I have never been so tired in my life.  Veronal didn't even help me to sleep. 
Good morning, Suzette.
Madam will dress now, it is late.
Madam, it is Mr. Meierheim -- he is waiting downstairs.
Packed to the ceiling. Hurry -- get dressed. And what an audience -- the French Ambassador -- American Millionaires -- Princess Ratzville -- er -- er --
Come along, oh, Madam, come along. The train will be going.
Oh, the sun -- it will be sunny in Tremezzo --
Good morning, Pimenov.
Certainly, sir.
I wish you a very good evening, Mr. Preysing. You are staying here, too, Mr. Preysing?
You're discharged.
Oh -- the Baron -- the Baron.
Yes, I know them --
If you will wait one moment, sir.
How is the house?
What's the use of asking, Gru -- he is at the train -- He will be there.
I want to dictate my statement for tomorrow. I can't speak without notes. I like to have things down before me in black and white.
What's bluff?
'Deal with Manchester definitely off! "Preysing, oh -- I'd never have thought it of you.
What you need is some relaxation.
Hi, Bobo.
He's a good kid. A salesman.
You're a thousand percent right!
Your kid's in the back here. He's crying.
Evening. Welcome to Phoenix.
Right in front of the room.
Well, that's what the law's for, isn't it?
The Tokyo Exchange is nine hours ahead of us, New York one hour behind. There isn't one hour of the day when both are open. Information moves, but it has to wait. Now, we have a young fellow working here -- Do you know what a hacker is, Mister Hebbing?
Take two, three days. Call when you get there.
It was a gift. It isn't worth anything at all?
Well, I'd have to see it, of course.
Whadaya say?
You're right. I apologize. But I still want to talk to you.
Makes no difference to me if they're only on commission. If they don't make good money, they're not giving us good representation, and we can't afford to have them around. Ever supervise salesmen?
Sounds like a good Idea.
What? Me?
And I'm Perk. Short for Percy, I'm afraid.
Good to have you back, Roy. I was just looking at --
So what's your story today?
I like those.
You're one to talk. Still running playback money for the mob.
You ought to put a bandage on that.
Well, sure, Roy. You want me to drive up --? Okay, fine, come on down.  It won't be a home-cooked meal, you know.
I wouldn't go in on a deal with her. She blamed you for it.
I need this, Roy. I can't run without money, and if I can't run I'm dead.
What?
You want a drink?
No, but I'm goddamn thirsty. Ice water?
That's good. You don't really belong on this side of the fence, you know.
If I should get out of the racket, that goes double for you. That's why you've got to change your life completely, go to some town, get a square job, live like a john yourself. If you try to do it your way, what future is in it?
Lilly, Jesus, what are you doing?
Where's the five?
Well, well. In a real hurry, are we?
Get well soon.
I don't see why we have to take the train.
You're on the grift. Same as me.
You talk the lingo. What's your pitch?
No no! He never calls the cops, not after we give him the blow-off.
Upstate.
Think about it. Okay?
Yeah?
What?  What for?
And hello to you, too.
Wait a minute! When did this happen, that we're partners?
Lieutenant Pierson, Phoenix police. I have a car here.
I grant you, it's a little odd, shoot yourself with a gun with a silencer on it, but it was hers, all right. It really is your mother, Mister Dillon.
Do you have any particular reason to say that?
Not that it matters.  This is the morgue?
Yes, I know, I know.
Not many laughs in this room, eh?
With all due respect, detective, you can't go blaming every brutal murder in Illinois on Michael Meyers.
One set of muddy shoe prints.
That's it?
Carter.
Think Eddie had something to do with it?
No shit?!
Nothing to fear.  The coast is clear.
Totally.  I checked all the rooms and closets...
Wait a minute... slow down... you're telling me Michael Meyers is my uncle?
Yeah, me too, Keri.
What are you doing here?!
You really think Eddie killed her?
You look kind of cold.
Linda!  He killed Linda!
Aren't they doing a terrific job this year?
You okay?  You seem a little off.
The tighter you squeeze, the harder he'll try to break free.
There's something I have to tell you both.  It's going to sound strange...
The serial killer?
No, Will, this isn't the alcohol talking.  It's the truth.
So you're really Michael Meyers' sister?
Look, they're staring right at us.
Whatever happened to women in back?
Guess they -- went to the fair after all.
Home is here in Grandma and Grandpa's new house.  At least while I'm in college. Remember our deal.
Promise?
He told me about the terrible things that happened here.  In our house.
He crept up these stairs and made his way into this room.  His sister's room. Right here. Where it all began.
This house is sacred to him.  It's the source of his memories -- his rage.  Mrs. Strode, I beg you.  Don't let your family suffer the same fast as Laurie and her daughter.
Come on, sweetheart -- what is this? Who's coming?
She wasn't here when I brought Danny home from --
My, God!  What have you done to him?
Do you know how insane this is?  Who am I supposed to be looking for?
Halloween.
Danny?!  Danny!
Where's the baby?!
What now?!
Christ, what a night!  Not even so much as a sign for five miles on that road!
Notify Haddonfield's sheriff; tell him we're on our way.  I want the entire staff on alert.  We go to code red lockdown for twenty-four hours.  If he is alive, I plan on bringing him back.
What is that?
There's more people moving eastbound down Old Reservoir Road past the elementary school.
Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.
No!!!
What do you know about Michael?
Who else knew I had the baby?!
I hope the men do.  I would rather the women didn't.
Home is important to a man.
At least we found the diamonds.
You don't know my mother-in-law, boy.
I didn't even scratch the surface. You're lucky, boy.  You come home, and nobody's here.  When I go home, everybody's going to be there.
You know what gets me?
I'm liable to find anything!
You know what gets me?  Those guys who went to the moon!  To the moon, boy!
You ever own a motorcycle?
I dunno, boy.
What's funny about that?
When we were up in the tree so long--with the bats.
Hi, Penelope.
I didn't like that violin thing. That was sad.
Anybody who'd drop an atom bomb on a city has to be pretty dumb.
Blue soup.
Would somebody please pass me the catsup?
It's possible, of course, that you'll die in Africa.
No matter what you say to me, I still think you're the greatest guy I ever knew.
Anybody home?
Life has denied me that thrill.
Dr. Woodly.  I should make a little list.
You think you could find me a pencil and paper?
I see.  And he came into the apartment one day, to demonstrate his wares, and your mother, as it happened, was charmingly en deshabille--
Excellent!
Big ones, little ones, teeny-weeny ones--just and otherwise.
As in "Death, where is thy sting?" He killed at least fifty men, wounded hundreds more.
Ask about the time he and I were parachuted into Yugoslavia to join a guerrilla band--in the war against the Nazis.
We blacked our hands and faces.  At midnight we crept out of the forest and into the village.  The name of the village was Mhravitch. Remember that name!
You're supposed to get hurt!
I'd like to use the sanitary facilities, if I may.
Wants to fix up her makeup, no doubt.
Alive and hale.  He's throwing a little surprise party for his own family.  Is your mother often this unstable?  Penelope!
Tomorrow's another day. PAUL You know what my English literature teacher said about you?
A hundred dollars!
Mom?
Gee whiz, Dad--
Get mad!  Tell me you don't like the way I treat your mother!  Tell me you wish I'd never come home!
You don't even know me.
He doesn't deserve this!  You don't know him.  It isn't fair!
You're thinking with your brain instead of your body.  That's why you're so tense!  Forget Norbert. Relax.  It's body time.
Honeymoon temporarily canceled.  The boy should still go out and exercise.  I have the impression he never gets any exercise.  He simply bloats himself with Fig Newtons and bakes his brains over steam radiators.
Cook, by God!  Cook!  You're the nigger now.
You don't know you want.  That's the way God built you!
It couldn't!
Such as?...
The doctor.
And no one's there now?
That's too bad.  I would rather have him at home--to see what I'm going to do.
I rang.  It seemed like the proper door for a servile, worthless organism to use.
Did you like it, dear?
Well--what have we here?  A family.
Money?  There's plenty of that. Mildred got the brewery.  You'll probably get the baseball team.
Testimonials of that sort are--are beyond my range.  I don't do them well.  That's a failing, I know.
He'll play with his rifle, I expect. That will cheer him up.
Honor, I suppose.
Give me that Goddamn thing!  Now get out of here, or I might kill you.  Who knows?
Norbert--you come, too.  Let him go, Harold.  Let him go.
Ooops.
Hello?  Oh--hello, Mother.
Look--this isn't my apartment, and there isn't anybody else here.  Mrs. Ryan won't be home for a while.
Will you please go?  An emergency!
Just her neighbor and doctor? That's all?
How was the emergency, Doctor? Profitable, I hope.
Well now--what seems to be the trouble with the patient today?  A touch of malaria, perhaps?
Good Lord.
You intend to crack my eardrums with your voice?  Will I bleed from my every orifice?  Who will clean up this awful mess?
You're old--so old.
I'm an honorable clown?
You hope.
No quarter asked.  No quarter given.
I see.
Don Quixote.
Something seems to have happened to my self-respect.
Like the saber-toothed tiger.
Don't shoot.
No.
New lives begin!
What are you going to do?
Leave the rifle here.
Jesus--I dunno.  You know.  What the heck.  Who knows?
It was a bitch.
What happened?
Aha!  Hello!  You're Mildred, right?
You were Harold Ryan's third wife. Right?
You bet I'll worry about it.  I said something wrong?
Don't touch me.  Get out of the way.
Don't touch me.
That's an interesting piece of news.
In a railroad accident many years ago.
Norbert was just beginning practice. A real man would have sold her to a catfood company, I suppose.  As far as that goes, J. Edgar Hoover still lives with his mother.
Are you and Dr. Woodly engaged?
Is Norbert still here?
Then who flushed the toilet?
Mom?
Yeah.
Don't worry about it.
Yes?
Did you see him?
Is he coming home?
We've got to find him.  I want you to show me exactly where you saw him last.  And you stay here, Norbert, in case he comes home.  That's all he said--the thing about the key?
You were wonderful.
The animals made her sneeze and cry too much.
I never knew when to hold it--or who to ask, or what to say.
Every night, Penelope, for the past two years, I've made it a point to walk through the park at midnight.
They didn't murder me.
He can make the sound of human footsteps--which is a terrifying sound.
No.  But he's going to be.  If he is in the park and he comes out safely on the other side, I can say to him, "You and I are the only men with balls enough to walk through the park at midnight."  On that we can build.
You know each other?
Everything's going to be beautiful.
Is that a fact?
You've got to fight from time to time.
It's the planet that's in ghastly trouble now and all our brothers and sisters thereon.
Chinese maniacs and Russian maniacs and American maniacs and French maniacs and British maniacs have turned this lovely, moist, nourishing blue-green ball into a doomsday device.  Let a radar set and a computer mistake a hawk or a meteor for a missile, and that's the end of mankind.
You think you're so funny.  You're not even funny.  Right?  Right?  You don't hurt yourself if you start out slow.
Kid--kid--
"Happy Birthday, Wanda June!"
We have this new club up here in Heaven.
Albert Einstein plays shuffleboard.
Hello. My name is Beatrice. Have you been here before?
We aren't gonna arrest him for that...
No.
Now, what do you want?
Who is it? That blond guy? Where is he? I'm going to talk to someone.
'Film Producer' -- that should be in caps, bold face.
Man, how many girls do you need?
Here? What a joke. There was some detective asking about that girl.
Up front?
Make it nine hundred. That was my best week.
I thought you were going to bed?
You have anything to drink? You want to go out and get something?
You're not a private detective either, are you?
Okay, tell me. Why do you live like you do?
Why? Are you a sex fiend?
Neither am I.
What's T-J?
What does that mean?  What does he do?
What the crap?
I can stop if you want.
Yeah.  Well, mostly.
They are the same.
Grand Rapids? Of course.
Andy.
No, I didn't think she was. Let me get the picture here. Let me guess. She was an absolutely clean girl, a model daughter, she never had rebellious or impure thoughts, she didn't fuck around...
Mast?
Where are you? The connection sounds very good.
This used to be a real city. I was here about fifteen years ago. Embezzlement case. It was always a little religious for my taste, but at least it was a city. With a downtown and all.
Have you ever seen any, ah, pornographic movies, Jake?
Do you know what a "hardcore" movie is?
Yeah. You ever seen any of those?
They're legal now.
Wait. Slow down. A film like this, 16mm, cost two three hundred dollars, sold outright, shown in peep machines, maybe theatres, maybe not, is almost impossible to track. 'Nobody' makes it; 'nobody' shows it; 'nobody' sees it. It's like it doesn't even exist.
It was called 'Slave of Love' when I bought it. Next time it's sold, it'll be called something else.
Jake?
You don't want to know.  Now, Wes, leave, please. For me.
Take it or leave it.
Fifty cents admission.
You don't want anything for your fifty cents?
I've got fifty thousand dollars to invest.
I got a picture here. I want you to tell me where to find this woman. I been asking everybody. Nobody knows anything.
I don't suppose you've ever seen this girl before either? Her name's Kristen, but I suppose you've never seen her?
What does that do?
Jake'll take care of me.
You remember me. Louise? Rhymes with squeeze.
You are at the University, Candy?
Lady, you were going 70 miles an hour in a 45-mile zone. Could I see your license, please?
Haven't we met before?
We planted it.
Because if you are...
Oh. It looks like a hearse.  Very nice. Compact.
And what do you do, my dear?
Edith was just telling me about her job.
Here's your shovel.
Eh, no.
Not <u>any</u> car. I like to keep a variety. I'm always looking for the new experience, like this one. I liked it.
What owners, Harold? We don't <u>own</u> anything. It's a transitory world. We come on the earth with nothing, and we go out with nothing, so isn't "ownership" a little absurd?
She's very sweet, but so old- fashioned. Please sit down, Harold. I'll put on the kettle and we'll have a nice hot cup of tea.
Harold?
It goes on and on.
What do you think?
You don't look eighty.
Oh, my. We're too late.
We'll come back in the morning.
What's that?
There. Oh, I like the feel of soil, don't you? And the smell. It's the earth. "The earth is my body. My head is in the stars."  Who said that?
I <u>think</u> I see it.
Did Confucius say that?
You are the wisest person I know.
Yes. I understand. A lot of people enjoy being dead. But they are not dead really. They're just backing away from life.  They're players - but they sit on the bench. The game goes on before them. At any moment they can join in.  Reach out! Take a chance! Get hurt maybe. But play as well as you can.  Go team, go! Give me an "L." Give me an "I."  Give me a "V." Give me an "E." LIVE!!!!!  Otherwise you'll have nothing to talk about in the locker room.
It's sinking, Harold. Going over the horizon - where we are all going to go. It's getting dark. "Let each man hold on to his candle and get a light where'er he can."
From the guys who got the matches, of course. 
Oh.
But they have.
But they'll put me in jail.
They'd put you in jail, eh? Well, historically you'd be in very good company.  That's what my husband used to say when we were in the French Underground dealing with the Gestapo. Would you like to do a little raking?  Work, I'm told, done with no selfish interest, purifies the mind. You sink your separate self and become one with the universal self. On the other hand, senseless labor is a bloody bore and should be scrupulously avoided.
Don't you advance on me.
That wasn't very scary.
Look at the stars.
Science thinks there isn't. That we are all alone in the universe.
- end where I began.
... which I hope will make you very happy.
Oh, Harold, don't upset yourself so.
Of course, Harold's father had a similar sense of the absurd. I remember once in Paris he stepped out for cigarettes and the next I hear he's arrested for floating nude down the Seine - experimenting in river currents with a pair of yellow rubber water wings. Well, that cost quite a little bit of "enfluence" and "d'argent" to hush up, I can tell you. Harold, dear, stop playing with your food. Don't you feel well?
I'm getting married.
I suppose you think this is very funny, Harold.
Do you play?
Tell me, Harold, how many of these, eh, suicides have you performed?
And why is that?
I don't think I'm getting through to Mother like I used to.
Yes. It does.
My mother spoke to my Uncle Victor. He's in the Army and he fixed it up.
You mean when I'm not working on a...
You liked your teachers?
Your classmates?
Let's examine the facts on it. I say this country has been too harsh in its outright condemnation of war. I say you can point to many material advantages brought about by a crisis and conflict policy. Hell, World War II gave us the ballpoint pen. That's common knowledge.
It's the greatest excitement in the world.
Will they really teach me to shoot?
And to use the bayonet? PACHOIE!
Good afternoon, Officer. Bit of trouble here?
Well, I didn't.
It's different for us.
Frank.
Oh, right. Daddy's died and gone to heaven, eh?
He... he loved me.
I knew you'd come back.
Sad, huh? She's been here six months. Her name's TIFFANY.
Almost complete withdrawal. She hasn't said a word for nearly two years.
Oh, Jesus. I can't explain. It's... it's. I don't know how to help! I have to save him and I don't know how to help!
Help. No, no-one can help. I just want someone to listen or I WILL go crazy.
What?
What do you mean?
I'm scared.
Wait!
What is this? Someone else you think escaped us, like Frank?
Where am I?
Steve...
The past, the future, whatever this object holds.
I break it, they see us, Happy Halloween. No more hiding.  Outside. I could be outside --
Remind me why I keep doing this.
harbinger of pestilence, seed of destruction --
What the hell was that? An ape?
I do.  How many escapes?  This year alone: five!
These freaks, Trevor, they give me the creeps. And I'm not the only one. You're up for review. You and your petting zoo.
A 16th century statue was destroyed. Saint Dionysius the Aeropagite.
Listen to me. This time is different. There's more at stake than ever before.
I worry about you.
How does he know so much about me?
"In absentia luci, tenebrae vinciunt..."
And as a father, I worry about him.  In medieval stories, Agent Myers, there's often a young knight, inexperienced but pure of heart...
Who's the squirt?
Got tired of me?
Uh-oh -- John.  Staring at what?
No, it doesn't make it right, but I stopped that creature, didn't I?
-- should go back. Now!
Whatcha looking at, John??
Helping you -- I just --
Down there. Did you ever loose track of him?
Myers, you're a talker. What's a good word -- a solid word for "need" --
You better have that looked at.
Goodnight, then.
It's freezing, isn't it?
What's happening?
Oh.
Nobody escapes us.
That's easily arranged. But first, back into bed.
Please listen to me --
You were holding onto it like grim death.
Don't touch me. Or so help me --
Come to Daddy.
Bastard.
You're Julia, right?
There is going to BE a wedding?
-- to heal me completely. Then we can be away from here, before they come looking.
Poor Larry. Obedient as ever.
A long time.
Don't touch it. It's dangerous. It opens doors.
They took my body, but my spirit... they left that here. In the boards, in the walls. Watching the world, but not able to TOUCH it.
So where's the harm?
She'll tell them everything...
Well we can't just stay here --
Kirsty.
What happened?
Not exactly modern.
You know we have to let Kirsty see this place, before we do anything to it. She'll love it.
It's probably going to need stitches.
Take it slowly.
Just a moment. Put on some music will you babe?
Who was it?
Dead.
Not much fun, is it?
Drinking alone.
Plain soda?
I suppose not.
You wouldn't believe me.
Well, if you change your mind. What's this friend's name?
Where are you?
I thought you were going to stay with us for awhile?
Upstairs.  Treat her gently, huh? She hates moving.
I just wanted to be sure you were O.K.
Yeah.
...maybe we should never have come back.
I guess.
Would you... maybe call round sometime? Try to make friends.
I have to talk to you.
I'm afraid it's true.
No you don't.
Get the fuck out of here.
Where are you going?
Oh no?
If I make it through the day.
Are you busy after work ?
What?
Rob.  Rob Gordon.  Circa junior high...
How can it be bullshit to state a preference?
Since you brought that bullshit tape in.
We'll do it next Monday.
What did he ever do to you?
I'd think you were a cinematic idiot. And I'd feel sorry for you.
I never thought I would say this, but can I go work now?
Shut the fuck up, Barry.
My band.
The band that found me and asked me to join.
Thanks for your support, Rob.  Really appreciate it.
Of course I'm not coming.  Do I look like I'd want to listen to some terrible experimental racket played in some hideous cave?  Where is it?  The fucking Bucktown Pub?  Ha!
It was Jan, and it was a long time after--
The little skate-fuckers.
110%.  That's my final offer.  I'm not kidding.  That's how much it means to me not to hear you play.
Sonic Death Monkey.
Barry, you're over thirty years old. You owe it to yourself and your friends and to your parents not to sing in a group called Sonic Death Monkey.
You'll be going over the fucking edge if you come anywhere near me next Friday night.
Why not?
It's almost impossible to find, especially on CD.  Yet another cruel trick on all of the dumbasses who got rid of their turntables.  But every other Echo and the Bunnymen album --
What?
Anna.
Right.  Why?
Oh.  Okay.
Yeah, well... Let's see... What are you're all-time top five records?
Is there a difference?
Well if one of them is this "Sin City" thing --
Who?  Oh.  My friend.  My friend is Laura.  A girl.  A friend who's a girl.
Good.  Great.  Yeah... Wow.  Rob Gordon.  Seems like a 100 million years ago now.
Hey.  Didn't you steal that one already?
Are you all right?
Let's not.
Rob --!
Well we rang $900 today.
I'm sorry, Rob, that's, it's --
I'm upset, but I'm fine.
Mmmm, no.  Not a good idea.
What needs sorting out?
Funnily enough I haven't been too thrilled about it.
Yeah.
You don't have to go this second. You can stay until whenever.
Jeez.  He goes on long enough.
-- Made.  Made.  Marvin Gaye is dead, his father shot him in --
-- Alright, alright but --
What were the others?
What's the obvious stuff?
I guess it's not that obvious, then.
Look.  Maybe you'll grow up and we'll get it together, you and me.  Maybe I'll never see either of you again. I don't know.  All I know is that it's not a good time to be living here.
Oh, Rob, shut up.
Well.  Sex, I guess.  Is sex with him better?
I'll look for 'em.  How you doing?
I told you I slept with him.
Is that why you wanted to see me?
Are you still in love with me?
I called and called but you were out.  I thought I'd be gone before you got back.
I'm sure.
You know I'm a good person.
Okay, okay.  I get the picture.
Hello.
Don't worry about it.  Just get into bed.  Worry about that when you're better.
I'm sorry.
What do you mean?
I've only got a couple left.  I'm saving them for later.
Laura...
What about Ian?
What it was like.
I'll pay for you.  Even though you owe me money.  We have to do something with the money I earn.  I need to. I deserve it.  You can just think of it as winning the lottery.
Less neurotic.  Are you intending to stay the same for the rest of your life?
All I'm saying is, you have to allow for things to happen to people, most of all to yourself.  Otherwise, what's the use?
Where?
No.  I don't think so.  I'm just curious about how one goes from making tapes for one person to marriage proposals to another in two days. Fair enough?
What's happenin'.
Actually, I'm fine.  I'm great. Last night I got to thinking, "you know what?  Maybe it is time to move on.  Maybe we're just not right for each other.  Or maybe we are.  But time will tell and at this point I'm going to be fine with whatever's meant to be." You know?
Don't you like that?
Is that why you came to Chicago in the first place?  Because of, you know, dividing up your record collection and stuff?
Awhile back, Dick and Barry and I agreed that what really matters is what you like, not what you are like...
What do you mean, the Crumblers? You know the Crumblers?  Nobody's heard the Crumblers.  Except me.
Jesus, so much for delicacy.  I pegged you for a master of understatement, beating around the bush and all that buzz.
Great.  Super-fantastic.
How would I know?  Gone.  Girlfriend. Leave.  Not say where gone.  Laura move out.
I knew this was going to happen.
What did Laura say?  Do you know why she left?
It must have taken him a long time to get them together.
Look... I... I'm sorry.  I don't want to be any part of this.
That's why I'm trying to compromise. What about fifteen-hundred?  They're worth five times that.
Uh, yes I, like, do... It's simple. You make the tracks -- recording studio -- deliver them to the pressing plant where a master is cut, the master is then dubbed to submasters, which are the "mothers," as their called, for each press in the plant. You press the CD's or records, put in your cover art, and that's it.
He'd want to know about all this.
How's your uncle?  I hardly ever see him anymore.
That stuff'll put you away if you're not careful.
Well, this is a small town, and it was even smaller then.  Most all the babies I delivered were from local families.  Richard's parents were just passing through when his mother's time came.  I did it right here at the house.
Poor little tyke didn't have a chance.  Hopelessly premature.  He died a few days after he was born.
This is against the rules.
Charming guy, Basil.  Once after beating an army of Serbians he blinded all but-
He tried to kill me last night.
He was innocent.
I'm a historian, Mr. Taupin. Only once in a lifetime do you stare history in the face.
No.
The estate stuff is pretty straight forward.  Just lots of forms and an appearance at the county seat.
And you are William Taupin, aren't you?
It's frightening sometimes the way you talk about other people's lives.
I hope I never get that old.
My life has been chock full of people with complications and weak- nesses.  I can't stand it.  But you're different.  It's in your hands.  A clarity.
He is older than I.
Perhaps.  There is something more. An inheritance.
I haven't killed _you_.
What is it like?  Being you?
But you're known so much. History I'll only read about.
What is it you want?
Gettysburg's an hour's drive at most.  You should be back by nightfall.
A murder.
I'm calling an attorney.
But there's more.  Wednesday someone played javelin with the cemetary curator in Felton, Delaware.  Some locals spotted two cars with D.C. plates and surprise surprise, they turn out to be registered to our own Brenna Cartwright and the ever popular Richard Taupin.
You've been a busy little beaver. Especially with that records mess up in Church Hill.  Your notes are very complete. Naturally my feelings were crushed when you didn't rush right over and tell us what you knew.  In fact, we're considering book- ing the ambulence chaser as an accessory to murder.
But we might just give it the 'ole college try.  What with the court back ups, it could be days before you got an arraignment. But then, I'm sure the flunk-out neice of the D.A. knows all about that.
I have witnesses that can put the two of you together.
Come on Brenna, your ass is already in a sling, don't drag me into it.
You talked to your supervisor lately?  He's burning up the place about you just dropping out of sight.  That on top of the cops bugging him.
Good way to lose your job.
I don't believe him.
Hang on a sec, you did your little favor for the boys downtown, I'm sure your uncle and the rest are perfectly capable of taking it from here.
Your marks would suggest great injury.
He told me there could be only one.
Conor, you and I, we cannot be killed.
Three days you've laid there. It's time you ate.
Harder!  You swing like an impotent cow!
It will take less effort as you learn.
This power is divided amongst you, me, and others like cuts in a pie. But the cuts are not equal.  Some, like you and he, have more.  Much more.
Live?  In less than a week you're prancing about the country like a squirrel.
Oh please.  Another one.
Who am I deceiving?
Complete your inspection?
Your name?
I thought I gave orders the regiment was to drill.
What is your position?
I am a Major, Private.  You would do well remembering that when addressing me.
Help?  I've seen others "help". Somehow a head always ended up on the counter.
We must talk.
Aye.  It is his duty.  All of ours.
Here.  The hook should go just below the head, where the meat is toughest.
Should have seen him the first night.  Son of a bitch stood there with a quart of blood on his pant leg and didn't even blink.
Smith.  Carl Smith.
The last four.
How did you find me?
Tasting and enjoying life is the only thing of value we have.  All else is just marking time.  You're marking time.
I want you to come to me.
Yes laddie, I have her.
This your present address?
Mr.-  Taupin, what were you doing in that alley?
What were _you_ looking for?
A claymore to be exact.  You wouldn't know anything about it would you?
It was covered with Mr. Fasil's fingerprints, but none of his blood.
Home.
You're one of William's kids, huh?
Such a pretty day.  If I live to be 90 I'll never tire of mornings like this.  Mind you I'm 74 now.
Are you back?
Oh, did you -- care for the poem, Mr. Burns?
You know, Hildy, he's not a bad fellow.
Oh, he's not the man for you. I can see that. But I sort of like him. Got a lot of charm.
If anybody had told me I'd be sitting at lunch with him -- but he swept me right off my feet.
All right. I've done it. Now, are you satisfied?
Then suppose you give me the money. Four hundred and fifty dollars.
This is a pleasure, Mr. Baldwin, and I'm sorry about the mistake.
But I see, she didn't mean old in years. You always carry an umbrella, Bruce?
Well, I'll try to give her one.
Well, Bruce, here you are -- certified and everything.
Well, I got to get back. You can find your way out, can't you?
I'll see she's there, Bruce, I promise you.
I know how you feel, Bruce, but you've got to forgive her. She's only a woman, after all.
Ts! Ts! Ts!
I'll find her, Bruce, if I have to put every detective in the city on the job. Tell you what -- go over to the Missing Persons Bureau and describe your mother. What does she look like?
You're barking up the wrong tree, Hartman.
No? Well --  Johnson, you're under arrest.  You, too, Burns.
I'm warning you -- it'll be a Federal offense.  And you'll be an accessory!
Does it? You forget the power that always watches over the Morning Post.
Let's see. I was in Reno six weeks -- then Bermuda... Oh, about four months, I guess. Seems like yesterday to me.
I'll always remember it. If I hadn't remembered it, I wouldn't have divorced you.
Was it my fault? Did I know that coal mine was going to have another cave-in? I meant to be with you on our honeymoon, Hildy -- honest I did.
I haven't any hard feelings.
I made a great reporter out of you, Hildy, but you won't be half as good on any other paper, and you know it. You need me and I need you -- and the paper needs both of us.
Well, you practically did! Making goo-goo eyes at me for two years till I broke down. And I still claim I was tight the night I proposed. If you'd been a gentleman you'd have forgotten all about it. But not you!
Sweeney! You can't do that to me! Not today, of all days! Jumping Jehosophat! Oh, no, Sweeney... Well, I suppose so... All right. If you have to, you have to.  How do you like that? Everything happens to me -- with 365 days in the year -- this has to be the day.
You've got to help me, Hildy.
Well, he's waiting in the anteroom for me now.
I suppose I can't call this off without creating a scene -- but remember, it's your last fling.
What do you mean, only an act? Haven't you got any feeling?
What do you think I am -- a crook?
Exclusive? That's great.
Never mind that. What's the story?
I meant on my grandmother's grave. Don't be so technical, Hildy. What's the story?!
Where do you think you're going?
You know! You've got the brain of a pancake! That wasn't just a story you covered -- it was a revolution! Hildy! This is the greatest yarn in journalism since Livingstone discovered Stanley for the New York Herald! 
Don't get technical at a time like this! Do you realize what you've done? You've taken a city that's been graft-ridden for forty years under the same old gang and with this yarn you're kicking 'em out and giving us a chance to have the same kind of government that New York's having under La Guardia! We'll make such monkeys out of these ward-heelers next Tuesday that nobody'll vote for them -- not even their wives!
Well, think it then, because it's true! We'll crucify that mob. We're going to keep Williams under cover till morning so the Post can break the story exclusive. Then we'll let the Governor in on the capture -- share the glory with him.
Can I call the Mayor a bird of prey -- or is that libelous?
What happened?
Where is she? Tell me!
Butch! I'd put my arm in fire for you -- up to here!  Now, you can't double-cross me!... She does? All right -- put her on. I'll talk to her... Hello! Oh, hello, Madam... Now listen, you ten-cent glamour girl, you can't keep Butch away from his duty... What's that? You say that again and I'll come over there and knock your eye out! Hello?  I'll kill 'em! I'll kill both of 'em!  Duffy!  Mousing around with some big blonde Annie on my time! That's co-operation!  Duffy!!
Wait a minute!  Let go there!
In a way.
Sorry, Hildy. I didn't mean to be making love to another man's fiancee.
Hildy!
Then why are you doing it?
And what a way to quit. While you're still champion! That's the way to leave, Hildy!
Sure, I can't last forever. I want a son I can train to take my place on this paper.
Well, if she looked like you -- Say! My brains and your looks -- that mightn't be such a bad combination.
What's the good of arguing about something that probably doesn't exist? Look, Hildy, I'm proposing to you. What do you say?
That's what he said the last time. Don't believe him, Judge.
Hildy, darling!
Who do you want?
Say, isn't this your twenty dollars?
There's money in it, Cooley.
They're always after me for interviews.
I don't know --
Now, the Sheriff will be Mollie Malloy, in whose room you were. You will be Earl Williams. And I will be the policeman. Follow me, Mr. Williams?
Well, that about covers everything.
Better let us in on it, Mollie.
You guys wanna play some more poker?
So have we!
We know what you're up to.
Take your paws off me!
Johnson, I'm going to the bottom of this. What do you know about Williams? Are you going to talk or aren't you?
That's murder!
If the Mayor wants me, he knows where I am.
A fine fair-weather friend you are!
After all I've done for you --
Pete, you're through!
Now, Pete! Please don't appeal to my Sentimental side.
Tell 'em to hold the wire.
Hold your horses -- will you, Olsen? Hurry up, Fred!
We'll fix that, too. 
You drunken idiot! Arrest him! The idea of coming here with a cock-and- bull story like that!
Fine, thanks, Sheriff.
All right. You can't. But tomorrow the Post will run the story of that roulette game on 43rd Street that your brother-in-law runs. And we'll print that you get five hundred a month for forgetting about it!
You can let him out on bail, can't you?
Search me! When I come to I was running down Thirty-fifth Street.
Hello, Hildy. I thought you were gone.
Did you get that, Hildy?
No -- and you don't know that your cheap boss has had Mr. Baldwin arrested again -- do you?
Hildy, I thought you were gone --
I don't know what she's talking about. I never said any such thing.
A gun?  Why -- to shoot, of course.
You're not going to phone anybody where I am.
Earl, you don't want to hurt your friends, do you?
Maybe you're my friend and maybe you're not -- but don't come any nearer. You can't trust anybody in this crazy world. Say, I'll bet I could shoot you from here.
What good'll it do?
They were all standing around when he wrote it. It was after they got back from fishing.
How much do you make a week?
They wouldn't take it.
Here's the picture of my wife.
What's your hurry?
Well -- Williams goes a little balmy and begins making speeches on a plan he's got to save the world. Only he makes his speeches, usually, on a very busy street and neglects to get a license for it. Well, the cops let him alone as much as they can because he's harmless and they're kinda sorry for him. But one day he decides to hold a meeting right in the middle of a Veteran's Parade and the cops chase him. He gets scared and goes into hiding.  Come in, Dave Schwartz.
Who? Hildy Johnson? She just stepped out. She'll be back in a second. Who? Oh, Mr. Baldwin. Well, if you'll hang on a minute, she ought to be right in. All right. 
What's he want?
Can I try?
Give him the you-know-what.
I never was.
I know a secret.
That word is special. That word is only for something really important. Now, repeat after me... Bugger off.
Bloody.
They pulled them up from all the crossroads, so when the Germans land they'll lose their way.
He's never going to come back. He's gone off to be a soldier and Mummy doesn't even know.
Tell them about Pauline's mum.
You're the biggest fibber.
Crocodiles! Aah!
Now, the googly looks like a leg break, but it's really an off break. Got it? Like this.
Well. Now we can do it slow. Are those some kind of stockings you're wearing?
Could you seal it over with hot pitch, Clive? Caulk it like the hull of a ship.
...It was a toss-up. His company went to India, mine went to France. Flip of a coin.
Consider Grace, the kids. I love them like my own. And you.
What did we know? We were seventeen.
How's your war, Mac?
I don't understand. Is there any point to it?
So you're going to be a grandfather.
Has Sue got it right?
And what's that?
What would we do if a German came into the house?
I can't do it. What's the point?
Remember this beach, Mac? All those summers. Out two families, together.
Mac, did you ever find out who Molly went off with?
Bless you, Mac. What would I have done without you?
I don't know how you cope, Grace. Three kids, army pay. On your own.
I'm so glad you could come. Here we are, all together again.
Yeah, it's a tree. I used to play there all the time. But, you can't find it without me. Outsider can't find no deadwood.
Maybe, maybe, maybe... hey, you know what word I hate?
Any cone, yeah...  I hate that word... sounds ugly, I don't like crumple either.
Oh, I know. I'll show you where it's at, sweetie. Aren't you just so cute all bundled up like a cinnamon roll of Christmas love.
Tiny's home.
Come on, ma... this bitch's got it coming.
I guess I'll try to back it out on the rim... at least to the main road.
OK, whatever. Let's go get your brother's truck. Faster we get the truck, faster we get out of here.
Mmmmm, this is tasty.
Hey, great they're back.
No! He's one of God's creatures, he can't help it if he's dumb... I'm just crazy about animals.
He walks, duh.
You all having a Halloween party tonight?
Yeah, yeah...  ...I like to fuck shit up.
How long have you been running this place?
You see me and my friends are writing a book on offbeat roadside attractions. You know all the crazy shit you see when you drive cross country.
As far a hot... goes I gotta go with... Ruth Ann Moorehouse.
I'll let it slide, she was only seventeen.
Hold on, I've heard this before... but I can't remember the end.
Shit, we really need to find some gas.
I dunno... we'll ask around as we get closer. Man, I really don't want to run out of gas out here in the middle of Petticoat Junction, man.
Keep straight on this road here.
I'm not exactly sure... it looks close. Did we pass an abandoned school bus yet?
Come on, we need something like this. It could be the real deal. It's too far out of the way to come back to.
Fuck! We are fucked!
Yeah, maybe R.J. could just tow us and our car to the nearest garage.
Shit, I'm all for being a sport, but this is ridiculous.
Well, don't even think about playing the good samaritan, there's way too many psychos wandering loose these days.
Officers, officers what can I do for you today? I ain't fried up the birds yet... if that's what you're ring a ding dinging about.
Is that all... think real hard.
I... I got back a stack today. Some nice shots.  See, a good topless June Wilkinson... unfortunately she personalized it...  to Stucky, love June.
Huh? Oh, hi. You really don't have a phone?
Tiny ain't got no car, he ain't even got a bicycle.
Huh?
Ugh, what's that smell?
Fuck, it's freezing.
So.
You know what Jerry, who really cares at this point?
Hey, nice outfit Billy Bob.
Thank you.
What are you laughing at?
You gotta be kidding me. This chick is wasted.
I can't... I can't move my arms. I hurt so much.
Too late. You're in for life, let's move it out Private Shutterbug.
Aw, it ain't crap... it's... cute.  ...and really who are we to judge the artistic merit of the tin-can Mona Lisa?
God, I hate falling asleep in the afternoon. Now I'll be up all night...  ...ugh, my back is killing me.
Don't even say it.
I think I'm going fucking crazy.
She said we look like pussy lickers or some shit like that.
How long has it been?
What was that?
Recover any bodies?
Shit, I wonder what these kids did to bring this much hell down on 'em.
That's the understatement of the year.
What'd ya got there?
Well Christ boy, don't stand there like a prize dog dick with his butthole caught up a tree.
Oh, really...  ...well, I'm a pretty good dancer if you know what I mean... I bet I got a few moves you ain't never seen.
We hit the jackpot! Let's roll, good buddy. We got ourselves a convoy.
OK lassies, I think it's time you get to gripping reality.
Why? Why are you doing this?
Behold... The Fish-Boy!
Well hello, officer.
Thank you.
That's true, Otis... not that we're having a bad time, but...
Local girl, Karen Murphy, been missing for a couple months, figured for a runaway.
Fuck, go to the car... call for backup. Tell 'em officer down.
Well, let's go see if the nut that runs this place can help us.
Your Spidey senses tingling.
I'm gonna see if anybody's home. You and Mr. Willis take a look around the grounds for any sign of anything.
Over.
Tell him, Harold.
Say my name.
No. Don't be silly. It's just...
Thank you so much for accompanying me.
I was in my p.j.'s when I remembered I left some papers I need to go over.  See? I rushed right out of the house. I must look a mess. I'm so embarrassed.
I should turn them off.  Maybe I sing him a lullaby my mama sang to me when I was a little girl.
Yet you look so sad. A great man like you should not be sad.
I am sleepy.
What is wrong, my darling?
Gabby, what is it?
Call you back.  You bastard! What do you want?
Well, I think...
I've moved on.
Lila?
Yes, please, somebody ask him what is wrong.
It shan't happen again. I swear it. I'm just getting my sea legs, you know.
Very well.
You what?
He's dead.
My brother is discreet.
Oh?
Go the fuck away, Rosie.
Uh, tie them up, Rosie. If you will.
As do I.
They don't seem to be especially ego driven, this is true.
I have to say that I'm not there yet.
Courtesy, decorum, manners, are all sadly lacking from our daily intercourse. Rudeness, vulgarity, meanness are the norm.
I'm sorry?
Boy, this is good!
It's just that I have some peculiarities, and...
Actually, Mother and Father, you look very, very old. You look terrible.
Do you? Oh do you, darling?
Shaving cream?
Feral? Don't touch him! He might be diseased! He might... My God, rabies!
It's perfect!
What are you doing in there?
Who is it?
I'm the same person I was before you knew, damn it! Oh God!
Really?
You remember that from my book? I'm touched!  What's wrong?
Who needs it? I have you and I have being a woman and I have thinking about womanly things! I love being a woman because...
Puff, I'm proud of you! You did remarkably well under difficult circumstances.
I'm going to go down and check on Puff. See how he's holding up.
How the hell would you know anything about the human heart?
Shut up!  I gave you... life. I created you in my image, Puff. I took you from this primordial ooze and brought you into the world of culture and art and manners. And this is how you repay me? By heading back to the ooze first chance you get? I should leave you here with Lila the ape woman. It would serve you right, you ungrateful piece of crap. But I'm not going to. You're too valuable to me. Totally selfish of me. You serve my purpose. But if you had any smarts you would realize that I serve your purpose as well. Life is so much more delightful when lived in a silk suit.
Oh boy!
Excellent work, Puff. Extra desert tonight.
Extra dessert?
Puff, why don't you say a few words to the assemblage.
Unn.
So anyway, that's the nightmare I've been having lately.
Oh, I see. Yes, that's something to think about. That's very good. That's what you get the big bucks, right? Ha ha.
Hey, another one for me and another one for the lady.
Give me a bottle of beer.
I'm ready.
It's all right, Eddie. I'm sure Mr. Gordon meant no offense. It was a figure of speech.
Oh, wait a minute, Miss Packard.
Are you ready for another?
In a little while. That's what you want, isn't it?
Put it on the bed. That's the way it's done, isn't it?
That seems a shame. The night is young.
Stay with this kid. He's a loser.
Okay?
Bourbon. J. T. S. Brown.
Only when I work.
I like it. It's good for you. Besides, you start drinking whisky gambling and it gives you an excuse for losing. That's something you don't need -- an excuse for losing. How did you make out in the poker game?
That's your problem.
Eddie, you're a born loser.
Wait a minute. Maybe I can help you.
How much you think you're worth these days? I'm puttin' up the money, I'm puttin' up the time. For that I get seventy-five per cent return on my money -- if you win.
I'm already rich. But I like action. That's one thing I think you're good for is action. Besides, like I say... you got talent.
Man named Turk Baker?
What happened to you anyway?
You must have a lot of confidence in me.
Fine.
I can beat him, Bert. Now he suckered me 'cause he knows how to hustle. I didn't think he did. But I can outplay him. I can beat him.
Fifty per cent?
You name it, we shoot it.
Okay, I'm Eddie Felson. I shoot straight pool. You got any straight pool shooters in this here poolroom?
You got that wrong, mister. I am.
You ought to take up crap shooting. Talk about luck!
Set 'em up again... C'mon, set 'em up again.
Looks more like a morgue to me. Those pool tables are the slabs they lay the stiffs on.
Ten grand. I'm gonna win ten grand in one night.  ...Well, who's gonna beat me? C'mon, Charlie, who's gonna beat me?
You walked out on me like that. No goodbye, no nothing. Like a thief in the dark. We were partners. We were more than partners.  He was like a... like --
Oh, you crumb. With that fifteen hundred I coulda beat him. That's all I needed, Charlie.
Yeah, to play Fats again.
You still don't see it, do you, Charlie? You are nothing but a small- time Charlie. You'd love to keep me hustling for you, huh? Wouldn't ya? I mean, a couple more years with me, scuffling around them little towns and those back alleys. You might make yourself enough to get a little poolroom back in Oakland. Six tables and a handbook on the side. Is that when you say goodbye to me, Charlie?
No, no more for me.
That's right. When?
Yeah. You must come again.
Hey, I'll tell you what -- I'll play you jack-up pool -- just keep one hand in my pocket.
What's the limit?
How much are you ahead?
You wanna raise the bet? Two on the five, five on the nine?
You quittin', friend?
How long you been waiting?
How long have you been waiting?
Just a cup of black coffee, please...  Hey, ma'am! Wait a minute!  Would you, uh, like another cup?
Have a nice trip.
Can I sit down?
What do you do on the other days?
Hey!
A day like any other. People come, people go.
Oh, you need a shave. You mustn't go looking like that. There's a razor and shaving cream in the bathroom. Compliments of the house.
Where you been all day?
Well, I believe you when you say you go to school.
You told Charlie to lay down and die. Will you say that to me too?  What happens, Eddie?
Sarah, do you think I'm a loser?
Well, he owns things.
You know, someday, Sarah, you're gonna settle down. You're gonna marry a college professor, and you're gonna write a great book. Maybe about me, huh? Fast Eddie Felson, hustler.
You need the words?
You glad?
Well, what's so funny?
No, I want to walk.
I'm going to Kentucky. To Louisville. With a friend. Try to make some money. I need it, the money. I'll be leaving early in the morning.
I got no idea of love. And neither have you. I mean, neither one of us would know what it was if we saw it coming down the street.
Where's Bert?
Well, that old lovin' horse paid twenty-two forty.  Let's see... two hundred I won from the jockey last night. And today at the track... I got five hundred and forty bucks.  Here, you hold it.
Go on back to the hotel.
Don't wear a mask, Eddie. You don't have to.  That's Turk, Eddie, the man who broke your thumbs. Only he's not going to break your thumbs. He'll break your heart, your guts. And for the same reason -- 'cause he hates you, 'cause of what you are. 'Cause of what you have and he hasn't.
Is that a fact?
And them fingers, them chubby fingers. And that stroke. It's like he's, uh, like he's playing a violin or something.
That is not now, human!
Who is this?
Was this -- "beautiful?"  Before?
Why don't you start with me?
Mine.
Humans.
That's who you are too, Emma.
Do you still want me to stay?
Emma...
Shhh... don't talk.
Only got one kind.
You built things.
We're going to be moving, son.
I know, son.  But you'll like it where we're going.  I'm getting a good job.  It's a pretty part of the country.
A meteorite, Dad, look!
... and Rigel.
It was so real, Dad.
What do you mean -- gone?  What the hell kind of a nurse are you, anyway?
Mr. Gardner, I don't think this is the place to discuss this matter.
Stay here.  I'm going to make a phone call.
No one comes here after dark.
Damn.
What is it?
But you saw -- the men go under the sand ...
You're looking for life?
Hi.  Sorry I'm late.
What do you want me to do?
I can't leave. We have to tell this to the President.
Better be. You left me for him.
Thirty seconds? Isn't that cutting it a little too close?
Are you all right?
Moishe Martinsburg, Mr. President.
Spunky. He told you about that?
What the hell is this?
You're in meal penalty for disturbing my lunch.
Yes, because the analog signal has a definite sequential digital patterns embedded within it. When I find the exact binary sequence and I apply a phase reversed signal to that calculated spectra analyzer I built you last Christmas, we should be able to block out the overlay completely...
I've got a lock on the signal pattern. We can filter it out.
What're you talking about?
What are you waiting? My social security will expire, you'll still be sitting there.
It's the White House, for crying out loud. You can't just drive up and ring the bell.
Not listed, huh?
Thanks, Pops.
Nice meeting you.
You were the head of the National Intelligence Agency! You knew all about this. When were you planning on informing the rest of us!?
Dick-weed!
So, what do you do for a living?
Really? Ballet?
I don't believe it. They make you learn how to fly everything from an Apache to a Harrier and still they turn you down? What else do they want you to learn?
Just what the hell do you think you're doing?
Troy's still my son no matter how you feel about me.
I want the Vice President, Secretary of Defense, the whole Cabinet and the Joint Chiefs taken to a secured location. I'm staying here. I am not going to add to a public hysteria that could cost lives.
Why the hell wasn't I told about this place?
See, we can't duplicate their type of power so we've never been able to experiment. But since these guys started showing up, all the gizmos inside turned on. The last twenty four hours have been really exciting!
Yes, but don't panic. Everything's under control. Have you... have you arranged our supplies?
All my life!
But if you want facts, Indy, I have none to give you. At my age, I'm prepared to take a few things on faith.
The present city of Iskenderun is built on its ruins. Marcus -- you remember what the Grail Tablet said. "Across the desert and through the mountain to the Canyon of the Crescent Moon."  But where exactly?
Yes. Now we know.
Indy... Indy, you must hurry!! Come quickly!
Indy! Henry! Follow met I know the way!  Haaa!
Tell me, what's going to happen when we get to Venice?
"Where the cup that holds the blood of Jesus Christ resides forever."
Hard to resist, isn't it? The Holy Grail's final resting place described in detail!
Let me tell you another "bedtime story," Doctor Jones. After the Grail was entrusted to Joseph of Arimathaea, it disappeared and was lost for a thousand years before it was found again by three Knights of the First Crusade. Three brothers, to be exact.
All I have to do is squeeze.
I never expected to see you again.
Elsa! Elsa, don't move!
But what are you doing here?
Humpf -- so I was wrong this time. But by God, I wasn't wrong when I mailed you my Diary. You obviously got it.
If only I could have been with you.
Ooooh... I like the Austrian way better.
Feels like a cigarette lighter.
I ought to tell you something.
Dad!
What?
This is intolerable!
Stop!
You're going the wrong Way! We have to get to Berlin!
There is more in the Diary than just the map.
Yes! The only thing that matters is the Grail.
What did you get?
You know, sharing your adventures is an interesting experience.
Well, I'm as human as the next man.
Do you remember the last time we had a quiet drink? I had a milk shake.
This is intolerable!
Dad?
The penitent man is humble before God.
You're strangely dressed... for a knight.
I'm going after those horses.
My father was looking for the Holy Grail. Did you kill him too?
Who are you?
Ask yourself, why do you seek the Cup of Christ? Is it for His glory, or for yours?
Charming.
Thank God all that mumbo jumbo rubbish is disappearing.
Then she must have run out of the room and you found her.
Hard to believe, isn't it...?
He's not exactly what we call "a spring chicken".
Miss Scott, you're not making any sense.
So, it is true, Dr. Jones? You found Nurhachi?
You have insulted my son.
What's that?
I ride with you, Indy?
That little Maharajah think he big stuff.
Next time I flatten him! Did you see his eyes?
He was afraid of you. He knows a tough guy when he sees one.
Get to sleep Indy -- I stay up and keep eye on things...
What does it mean, Indy?
The village knew their rock was magic -- but they didn't know it was one of the lost Sankara Stones...
Slow on the curves or we'll fly off the tracks!
Give me the stones!
You will go to palace there.
The evil starts in Pankot. Then like monsoon, it moves darkness over all country.
I like the service here.
Look out, damn it, I need that antidote!
Me seduce you? Honey, you're the one who took your clothes off.  I just came over to remind you that you never know what else might be in the water.
A what...?
Can you move your arm?
I'd like to find one of those myself.
Any more complaints?
You're nice. Listen, I'm taking applications -- how'd you like to be my palace slave?
Yeah -- and nothing else.  That shock you?
Oh my God! He ripped out his -- he killed him!
Down? Down there?! Are you crazy!
It's okay. You're all right now.
Let her go! Our only chance is outrunning them!
Well, you didn't get your prince, and there goes your diamond.
I get it!
This is the first time anybody ever cried when I left.
I don't appreciate being cooked like a french fry!
I'm reporting you to the .....transit authority!!!
Somebody's been here.
Are you threatening me?
The Nicholson Node. I suppose you haven't heard of that either.
What are you doing?
I'll tell you what to say.
I don't know...To get Al.
Yeah...Who is?
You are CRAZY!
Thanks.
They'll have to take you apart. ...piece by piece.
Like the guys that attacked us.
Black suits and helmets.
Gone where?
What is it?
It's illegal.
What's wrong with how I carry myself.
Oh yeah, to what?
Eating sushi?
Here...all the seaweed you want. Now, what?
Now what?
I don't want to eat it.
Now lie down somewhere quiet and rest, I'll be back in a while.
Al, are you doing anything in there?
She's...pretty fast.
What is it?
What do I do?
What?
Touch her.
Good thing I'm here to do the thinking.
You stumbled around. Remember, you've got my ID, you've got to be me, not some stumblebum.
Yeah. I did it.
But what's it look like?
You really like that shirt?
I feel like an idiot.
Just don't show fear.
Maybe she's telling the truth.
It's embarrassing.
And on my time.
Better. I found Ryuji.
What was it? What'd I say?
Left...The one with the red dot.
Aim just in front of his face.
There's a lot you don't know.
This may hurt.
What happened?
She works for them.
I know it's no good.  I've no right to be jealous.
In a way, we're like brothers... I can't have her. I want you to.
Can you fly this?
I'm...scared.
Nice?
In him?
They have stolen state property.
I knew he was following us. He diverted attention, exposed Ryuji's trap..
What Job?
Who is your friend?
Well, I'm glad to see you. Sorry things broke up like that.
Yes?
Enough ROmance.
I don't want to intrude.
What brings you here?
And...you know Jan Gruner?
Your memory.
I don't know...the last couple of hours...last few days.
When you remember...
Al?
Not...complaining, actually.
And you, there are many places to get away. Why here?
How's that Trucklhouser Beer?
Yes...What is it?
What do you want?
What?
Is someone else here?
Blake said that?
I'll be right there.
I can't do that?
Wait. What's your name?
And you?
You again.
Promise you what?
I promise you that. I am not crazy. Course, if I was, I'd be the last to know. Why do you ask?
But I don't listen...then I'd be crazy.
And how'm I doing?
...Ummm, you really work for the foreign service?
Who do you work for?
Trans Ocean Travel.
Joe! What happened to you?
Your friends, did they ask about me?
What did you tell them?
He didn't.
Who did?
You're leaving.
I'm leaving too.
This business is over.
You know where he went?
I don't know. He mentioned a city.
Hiroshima.
Wait a minute! How'd you know Dieter was coming here?
What?
I know the territory.
What happened?
Kiss her you fool.
I knew it. I told him.
It was me. He just told me how...I wish he could tell me now.
Must be a fulfilling occupation.
We've had thefts of our new stuff ...GRUNER deals in this... A big deal is going down now. I went to see if GRUNER had anything to sell. But he didn't make any moves...And when you arrived, he backed off.
Water fountain's through that door, down the hall.
It will be fine. You have another.
Screw the PEM...What about Al...
What'd he say, how's he know about Al?
Look, nobody knows we did it.
Hi, honey.
Sweetheart, c'mon. C'mon.
He's into kind of little cars, that...
Let me tell you something, Lowell. Look, look, look. You're talking about two agents in a regional office in Louisville. I got the goddamn Unabomber threatening to blow up LAX! I gotta move 45 agents from all over the country into L.A.  Alright? When I get a chance, I'll give it a look...
Three hours.
Well, are you or are you not, Charlie?
Are you all right?
When's the air date?
Sure.
So, what are you going to do?
The New York Times ran a blow by blow of what we talked about behind closed doors! You fucked us!
That's happening. And, hopefully we won't have to use the alternate, but we should have it in the can.
What caliber is my gun?
Oh, Bill... Main Justice is investigating a major New York bank. Laundering narco dollars out of their Mexico City branch. You want it for the Evening News?
Shall I send for coffee? Sorry I'm late.
No, only that we would hold the story until it was safe for him...
Come again?
Is CBS corporate telling CBS News do not go to air with this story?
Hello?
Lowell?
Is there any more rice...?
Please don't wash your hands in the sink.
No classes this morning?
Two p.m. Great. Bye-bye. 
What?!
Jeffrey Wigand...
"I'm Lowell Bergman, I'm from '60 Minutes.'" You know, you take the "60 Minutes" out of that sentence, nobody returns your phone call. Maybe Wigand's right. Maybe I'm hooked. What am I hooked on? The rush? "60 Minutes"? What the hell for? Infotainment. It's so fucking useless, all of it.
From my perspective, what's been going on and what I've been doing is ridiculous. It's half-measures.
Well, I'm working with someone, now, who was the former head of research at Brown & Williamson, a former corporate officer there.
He referred to this... the Seven Dwarfs...
It went great in Mississippi, Mike.
Lowell.
Did I get you up?
How many shows have we done? Huh? C'mon, how many?
I see a rhetorical question on the horizon.
In the real world, when you get to where I am, there are other considerations...
C'mon, it all worked out. You came out okay in the end...
How have you liked your stay?
Please to explain, why I should agree to interview... with pro-Zionist American media?
I know what I have to know.
...but that's as far as I go...
This is my house... In front of my wife, my kids?! What business do we have?
Like where'd you work before Brown & Williamson?
Seven dwarfs?
The internet said you did graduate work in Wisconsin, then went to UC La Jolla with Professor... Marcus?
I drink. A couple of occasions more than I should have.  I was cited for shoplifting once. But it was a mistake...  I pushed Liane one time. We were both stressed out because of the pressure. She went to her mother's.  I got fired because when I get angry I have difficulty censoring myself. And I don't like to be pushed around!
No, don't evade a choice you gotta make be questioning my reputation or "60 Minutes'" with this cheap skepticism!
Lowell, I can't afford --
"Part of the reason I'm here is I felt that their representation clearly, at least within..."
ABC Telemarketing Company.
That's the whole point, Jeffrey. That's the whole point. Anyone's. Everyone's. They are gonna look under every rock, dig up every flaw, every mistake you've ever made. They are going to distort and exaggerate everything you've ever done, man. Don't you understand?
That's not the fucking point, whether you told the truth or not! Hello...?
I've got to teach class. I've got to go. I've got to teach class.
You try and have a good time.
What do you mean there is no family?
Jeff Wigand, Michael Moore.
Poor communication skills.
Object to the form of the question!
Hello.
My co-counsel, Ron Motley, and I have filed a lawsuit against the tobacco industry on behalf of the State of Mississippi to get the state reimbursed Medicaid costs for treating people with smoking-related illness.  If you'd be interested in talking to us, we'd certainly like to talk to you...
Jeff's a premiere golfer... What are you, a two handicap?
Your husband, who has beaten you -- repeatedly --
Please -- was at the time brandishing your firearm, trying in his rage to shoot an acquaintance -- friend of long standing --
Baby. You are so HOT!
Therefore in an effort to remove any trace of suspicion from my sweet Howard -- I wish to execute a pre- nuptial agreement.
They say the Massey pre-nup has never been penetrated.
Course I can't do much "wriggling" if you tie me up like that again. Massey -- this is one bad bad little girl.
I... uh guess congratulations are in order.
I am here representing Mr. Dumbarton, on a... matter of some delicacy.
Well, actually, all whores worship the dollar, if you want to get technical.
She got absolutely nothing. Zero. Zip.
It was a gift from a client.
You were going to be a Cardiac Surgeon. I was going to clerk for the Supreme Court.
Yes. The inability to experience pleasure.
You should have tried to get pregnant Marylin -- solidify your position.
You like kids.
Maybe she wanted a free trip to LA. Maybe they offered her money. Massey is very seductive. Who knows.
How nice.
As a matter of fact, I'm a huge fan.
He'll regret this.
All girls enjoy a little rough trade from time to time.
Yes. He's a diamond in the rough. And I have a feeling that someday soon you'll be taking that diamond and leaving the rough.
It has bones. Be sure to swallow one.
To victory.
Okay. Should I stop at Starbucks and pick up a blended for --
You have wonderful art. I love that lithograph. Hockney?
And I'm not used to -- Marylin -- there's something I want to ask you.
No... That wasn't right. I want YOU to be MY wife.
But?
I'm sorry. I'm squishing you. I'll move to the...
Hardly. You have six bedrooms
Exactly. And then -- maybe -- not right away -- There's a room right off the bedroom -- It would be perfect for a nursery.  It's a walk in humidor right now -- but if I took out the refrigeration unit --
Miles. I have a very good relationship with all the salesmen. I can return everything.
Salary. Unreported income.  By the way, what time IS it on Bellagio Road?
Drop the bogus forgery charge and I'll forget about your generous friends slash clients.
But then -- I guess -- something inside me died when I realized that you'd hired a goon to kill me.
You're forgetting Howard Doyle?
Sweet.
Hello, Rex.
You want to come out to the beach house tomorrow?
Do you know him?
Lilly's up.
Well, if he continues to maintain this position -- we're in court.
That stinks. They left you with absolutely nothing. It makes you wonder about the entire legal system. Like Rodney King.
Sarah Sorkin. Ramona Barcelona -- this is Miles Massey.
Is this Ming?
So, Miles. If you have a proposal, let's hear it.
Ha Ha.
Why not a hundred and fifty percent?
Are you familiar with Kirshner?
...The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars...
Mr. Rexroth.
When I first met Marylin -- Well, we were crazy about each other. Not emotionally, of course. We just couldn't keep our hands off each other.
In anticipation of making you sick.
I'm sorry I'm late. I was having lunch with Ruth Rabinow's assistant. Guess what? Marylin Rexroth is divorced!
Kenneth this is my associate, Wrigley. Wrigley this is my friend, Dr. Beck.
Let me tell you something about Patty.
Can't you get them to go any faster?  This dissolves to a deserted ROAD, Peter at the wheel of his car. His high spirits find expression in his efforts to sing.
don't know. I'd have to see on what you base your claim. I presume you feel you're justified in-
I sold some drawers and socks, too; I'm throwing those in.
Why not? I'm not charging you for the time I wasted.
What ten thousand?
Who said anything about a reward!
Know what my next move is? No more cigarettes.
You ought to know why. Because-
You can't tempt me.  Do you hear? I won't eat!
Where are you taking me?
Well, everything's set. Creating quite a furor, too. Great stunt King's going to pull.
What's the matter, Ellie? What's wrong?
I haven't seen you cry since you were a baby. This must be serious.  Where'd you meet him?
Been sending her meals in regularly?
We've done that already.
Here's another wire, sir. This one's from Charleston.  "Checking every northbound train. Also assigned twenty operatives to watch main highways. No success yet. Will continue to do everything possible." Signed: Lovington Detective Agency, Charleston.
They're practically all the same, sir. 
No.
Oh, I wouldn't kid you . On the level, it actually happened. Nobody bought a paper that day. They followed me all over town and read the news from the seat of my pants.
Oh, yeah?
I don't want it reported!
Oh, thank you.  We're in Jacksonville, aren't we?
Don't tell me you did it on my account!  hope you're not getting any idea that what happened last night is-  You needn't concern yourself about me, young man. I can take care of myself.
What for?
If you promise not to snap my head off, I'd like to thank you.
That, I suppose, makes everything-uh-quite all right.
Do you mind joining the Israelites?
You'll find the showers-and things-right back of the second cottage. 
Well, I hope you're not going to dictate whom I can talk to.
He apologized for last night.  Said he didn't know we were married.
Thanks.  You think this whole business is silly, don't you? I mean running away and everything.
Yes, you do. You think I'm a fool and a spoiled brat. Perhaps I am, although I don't see how I can be. People who are spoiled are accustomed to having their own way. I never have. On the contrary, I've always been told what to do and how to do it and where and with whom. Would you believe it? This is the first time I've ever been alone with a man!
King-King Westley was in it.
Say, you were pretty good. Jumping in like that. Got a brain, haven't you?
I better go over and see her.
Yes, I noticed he was getting a little fat lately.  Ouch!
I wish you'd stop being playful.
I don't think there's a "piggy- back" rider in your whole family. I never knew a rich man yet who was a good "piggy-back" rider.
All right. You win. Let's forget it.
I wasn't gone more than a minute. Just went out to find you something to eat.
You don't think I'm going around panhandling for you.  Best thing in the world for you-carrots. Had a tough time getting them. If that farmer ever caught me-goodnight!
Oh, that's nothing. Now take number three, for instance. That's a pip. It's the pathetic one. When you're broke-and hungry-and everything looks black. It's a long movement like this-  -with a follow through.
Here comes a car!
You! Don't make me laugh.
You don't have to eat the carrots.  Just passed a pond with some ducks in it.
I couldn't arrive in New York at three in the morning. Everybody's in bed.
Whatever you say, darling.
Eight o'clock tonight.
In about fifteen minutes.
Hey, what's this? Wearing Papa's things? Now that's cute. That's what I call real lovey-dovey. Yessir.
What's up?
Did you know he reversed the charges on that call?
Get out of here!
What!
If it's on the level.
You!
Wouldn't have made a bad story, would it?
Yeah, where am I?
They made me get 'em a rope and a blanket, on a night like this.
There you go-trustin' people again. How many times did I tell you-
Travelin' like this, you kinda lose track of what's goin' on in the world.
It's a lotta dough. If I was to run across that dame, you know what I'd do?
Got a couple of kids, huh?
You love them, don't you?
Boss, Oswald impersonators?  Sounds like James Bond now.
If this is Oswald, it must be our third Oswald.
There you go.  Grain of salt.  Two sides to every coin.
Did he pay?
All this blubbering over that sonofabitch!  They're grieving like they knew the man.  It makes me want to puke.
Well, the kid musta gone nuts, right?  I said Oswald must've flipped.  Just did this crazy thing before anyone could stop him, right?
What do you think, Lou?
You know you keep saying that.
Clay Bertrand?  Sure I know him.  He comes around the Quarter.
I told your uncle I never met a lawman who wasn't a punk.  You too, Bill, even if you're family.  He's a big shot businessman.  I seen him on the TV news a lot with all the other big shots.  A fag, you know.  Goes by another name down here.
What the hell's a Communist like Lee Oswald doing working out of Banister's?
That's fine, Numa, but what about all the people who aren't writing letters.  They're sitting home reading all these lies.  I just heard NBC crew's in town to do a "White Paper" - not on the Kennedy killing, but on us.  One of their top guys, Harry Stoner, is talking to everybody he can find about you, boss...
All right, all right.  Break it up.
Shaw's our toehold, Bill.  I don't know exactly what he is, where he fits, and I don't care.  I do know he's lying through his teeth and I'm not gonna let go of him!
I know this, Bill - Lyndon Johnson got $1 billion for his Texas friends, Brown and Root, to dredge Cam Ranh Bay for the military in Vietnam. That's just for openers.
The Fontainbleau?  20 minutes?
Dave, I always play square.  No bugs. I'd love you to go on the record, but I"m in no hurry.  Whenever you're ready.
Do you mind if I smoke, Mr. Garrison?
No... if he did, I don't remember him.  There were lots of kids in and out... y'know.
No, I never saw him before in my life.
Oh, it was just a spur of the moment thing...  the storm wasn't that bad.
We went straight to Houston, and then Saturday night we drove to Galveston and stayed over there.
I believe the boys got a couple.
Yes, now I remember, Mr. Garrison. I'm sorry, I got confused.  We got out there near the geese and it was only then we realized we'd forgotten our shotguns.  Stupid, right?  So of course we didn't get any geese.
Then who killed the President?
Shit!  Forgot to glue this fuckin' rug today.  You know, at one time I even had a full head of hair like everyone else.  And then I lost that. That fuckin' Clay Shaw.  I hate the bastard.  All I got left is in his rotten, bloody hands.  He tipped the newspapers - I know it.  That's how the Agency works.  They use people, chew them up, spit 'em out.  Now it's my turn.
They'll get to you, too - they'll destroy you... They're untouchable, man...  I'm so fucking exhausted I can't see straight.
Your Honor, I would ask you to direct the witness to answer my question. Why did Colonel Finck not dissect the track of the bullet wound in the neck?
That's our case!
Are we going away, Daddy?
He asked me why I thought I was in danger and I said:
I want the truth.
Don't get sidetracked!  How does he get back to the States?  That's the point.  Does he have any problems?
The Oswalds are introduced by George de Mohrenschildt to Janet and Bill Williams.  It's through Janet Williams in October '63 that Lee gets the warehouse job, right smack on Elm Street at the Book Depository, which is owned by another oilman with ties to defense and military intelligence.
All I can find out about the Williams' is their tax returns are classified and that Bill Williams, a descendant of the Cabots of Massachusetts, has links through his family and United Fruit to the CIA and does classified work for Bell Helicopter which requires a security clearance - so what is Oswald, a defector, doing visiting his wife in his house? Williams has a relationship at Bell with General Walter Dornberger, another one of the Nazis we brought in after the War for our missile program.  He used slave labor to build the V-2 Rockets for Hitler before Bell needed him.
Aren't you being a little hard?
No.
No, I don't believe I know anyone by that name.
Mr. Shaw, this is an Italian newspaper article saying you were a member of the Board of Centro Mondo Commerciale in Italy, that this company was a creature of the CIA for the transfer of funds in Italy for illegal political-espionage activities.  It says that this company was expelled from Italy for those activities.
I can't believe a man as intelligent as Earl Warren ever read what's in those volumes.
No.  I told you I was going to talk to Shaw.
Nothing is going to happen to you. I won't let it.
Honey, come on.  The government wants you to be scared.  They want everybody to be scared to speak out.  They count on it.  But there's nothing to be scared of.
I want to thank you, Mr. O'Keefe, for this time.
Oh no!... How bad?
I know David - a strange character.
Post Office.
They took 'em to the Sheriff's office, not the police station, and they let 'em go.  No record of them ever being questioned.
That means we gotta subpoena Time- Life on it.
Who do you think changed the parade route?
You know who the mayor was?
Earle Cabell.  And guess who his brother is?
General Charles Cabell.  Deputy Director of the CIA.  Fired by Kennedy in '61 because of the Bay of Pigs fiasco, he moved back to the Pentagon, called Kennedy a "traitor".  When he came to New Orleans to address the Foreign Policy Association, you know who introduced him?  Our friend Clay Shaw.
You know, something always bothered me about that from day one, and I can't put my finger on it.
Hell, you're the District Attorney. You read the Warren Report - and then you tell me you're satisfied Lee Oswald shot the President all by his lonesome.
Jim Garrison?
I don't... I can't believe it.  They killed him because he wanted to change things.  In our time - in our country?
The size of this is... beyond me. Testify?
I knew the man 20 years.  That's him.  The way he walked... arms at his side, military, the stoop, the haircut, the twisted left hand, the large class ring.  What was he doing there?  If anyone had asked him, he'd probably say "protection" but I'll tell you I think he was giving some kind of "okay" signal to those hoboes - they're about to get booked and he's telling 'em it's gonna be okay, they're covered.  And in fact they were - you never heard of them again.
And he never hit you before?
Well, I'd ask Guy - we were friendly, you know - heart attack, wasn't it?
Where is Banister in all this?
Never.  Not with me sir, never... Listen, I think I'd better go.  I said enough.  I said all I'm going to say. 
Even my own wife, chief,  Who's wondering where I am?
Hate mail here.  Fan mail here.  The bad news is the IRS has just requested an audit on your income from this office.
Where were you?  Europe, Pacific?
You were lucky.  I spent three years in the Pacific.  I've never seen an avenue with such a profusion of bail-bonding companies. Why is that?
I'm going to be very frank with you. You've done a great job, an astounding job considering the limited resources available to you.  But the best you can ever hope for is to stir up a lot of confusion.  You're not going to do this country any good, and you're not going to do yourself any good.  You don't belong here.  On this Mickey Mouse street with that cheap strip of bail bond shops.
Do you walk home?
This looks pretty good on me.
I understand.
What the fuck can I say? I'm serious, man. What the fuck can I say? Thank you... thank you... thank you.
How old is that machine gun shit?
Three years. That crime's old, man. They ain't got room in prison for all the motherfuckers out there killin' people. How they gonna find room for you?
Uh-huh.
Fuck that shit, man. I ain't shootin' anybody.
Look, man, I know I owe you --
You got a good lawyer?
What's going on?
She sound scared?
Hi, I'm Detective Mark Dargus. L.A.P.D. can I ask what you have in that bag?
You should know if you bring in anything over ten thousand you have to declare it. You forgot or what? You could get a two hundred and fifty thousand dollar fine, plus two years in prison. Now you want to talk to us about it, or you want to talk to Customs?
What's this?
But now you're telling us now you do.
How was your flight?
Can we stop for cigarettes?
Couldn't we just stop at a seven- eleven?
You gain weight?
That's why I don't quit. If I can't fly anymore, I'm gonna have a bitch of a time gettin' my brand.
But they won't want to take you to trial. They'll offer you simple Possession, a few months of County time, and a year or two probation.  How 'bout another?
I wrote him on Monday. They found him dead on Tuesday.
Same as you. Ten thousand.
But if all I can give 'em is Ordell's name -- I don't really know shit about what he does or how he does it -- That don't give me much to bargain with.
Thanks, but I have my own now.
What, I couldn't hear you?
He had his doubts at first. But he's always trusted me an wants more than anything to believe he still can.
How do you feel about getting old?
Really?
Catching a movie.
"American President"
How old's Annette?
What're you, a bag lady?
You talk them into it?
You don't actually do it that way?
I have to stand behind all my active bonds, but I'm not writing any new ones.
Hi, I'm Max Cherry. Your bail bondsman.
Did you do it that night?
It never was, so I'm not gonna start worrying about it now. Look, Ray more or less believes my story, and he more or less doesn't care. All he really gives a shit about is getting Ordell.
Get Ordell to come to your office.
Sure I can't twist your arm?
I thought you were tired of your business?
You tell those guys they'll have to do one helluva lot better than that before I'll even say 'hi' to them.
He say we like the same thing as married.
Sometimes every day, for a while.
You know what we want.
You ever see him sell guns?
I'm recording this.
...Compton with a fifty-six-year- old petty thief -- woman named Simone Hawkins.
It was her coke I got busted with. She knows everything, but she's not part of it, and she's pissed cause she's not part of it. Ordell wouldn't even let her stay at the meeting. She tried to talk me into ripping off Ordell.
I smiled and walked away. She also told me Ordell killed Beaumont.
That's fifty thousand, huh? It doesn't look like that much.
Yes. All those things are true.
I got there early. I've had my eye on this suit -- Wait, let's start over. I got there early. The idea was to try on the suit, see if I liked it. If I did, get them to wrap it up, and change back into my uniform. That's what Sheronda's expecting me to wear. Go meet Sheronda, give her the bag with fifty thousand, and go home.
You took the time to pay the saleswoman.
What did you do after that?
I have no idea.
Louis Gara's dead. L.A.P.D. found him dead in a car on Ninth. And we've lost Ordell.
I'm waiting for the phone.
You think I'm kidding?
Jackie?
Are you getting that black suit?
It looks good on you.
Well, then, why don't you be a good hostess and make me a screwdriver?
The same guy who put me in, thanks a lot.
I'magine they asked who you givin' it to, too.
And what was your answer?
Yeah?
I'm tellin' you, those cops been fuckin' wit your mind. They turn black against black, that's how they do.
I bet you come here on a Saturday night, you need nigga repellent keep 'em off your ass.
Didja tell 'em anything else?
No, I give it to someone else first.
The money's in a Broadway shopping bag. I get some food, and sit down here in the food court. Then your girl comes -- you got somebody yet?
Look, it's my ass facin' the penitentiary. You send some hard- headed roc whore, and she fucks things up.
Drink?
Are you sure she don't know about the money?
What does she think she's gettin?
She saw you with Sheronda. So Simone goes to the dress department with her Robinson's/May bag.
It's boring, isn't it?
Want a hit?
Want a Metrix?
No, it's what body builders drink to beef up.
Where were you?
That's the guy I lived with... his name was... Hirosh.
That's not what I'm saying at all.  You know where he went?
He went to meet that stewardess.
Lemme have the bag.
I'm carrying it.
Is it this aisle or the next one over?
I mean it. Don't say one fuckin' word.
Thanks, Baby.
Guess where I am?
I know you don't know. I said guess.
I'm talkin' to you from the comfy- cozy interior of an Oldsmobile parked outside your nasty-ass welfare motel.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Can I ask you about Melanie?
I haven't even looked at it yet, it's still in the shopping bag.
So what, you left her there.
Couldn't talk to her?
So you're sure she's dead.
Maybe forty, maybe not that much.
How long was she in there?
Louis, You tellin' me the truth?
Where you shot her.
What'd you shoot her with?
I'm going out for a few hours.
How can I help you?
Ten thousand sounds high.
Beaumont Livingston.
Hey, Max.
The bond for possession is only a thousand.
You didn't hear?
Brown, Jackie Brown.
That's what the police thought. I told them I'm unemployed, how could I have anybody work for me? Now I bail out Jackie, I'm liable to have the police on me again, huh? Wanting to know was she doing things for me, was she bringing me that money!
Man, you know I'm good for it. Thousand bucks ain't shit.
The bond collateral on Beaumont Livingston you moved over to cover Miss Brown, remember?
I'm telling you, you got her spooked. She won't leave there till you have your money and you're gone.
Turn left.
My money's in that office, right?
Who is it?
We're back.
Hello.  Hey, Jackie...  No, Jackie, I didn't get your message.
Hope you don't mind keeping him company.
Get me out of here.
Dead? No. I just hurt my back. I'm not dead.
It's all been a dream.
What do you want?
Something weird is going on here. What is it about us? Even in Nam it was always weird. Are we all crazy or something?
Grass never did that to me.
You're hurting me!
Daddy. Let go.
You have an unusual hand.
Things happen? What the fuck are you talking about? They did something to us, Frank. We have to expose this.
Jesus Christ! Who's been talking to you?  What's going on? How can you just turn away?  What about the others?
Shit! You know it's not half the case if I go it alone. We're all suffering the same symptoms, Frank. The army is to blame. They've done something to us. How can you not want to know?
Hey, wait!
There was a bang.
I am.
Listen, will you listen? They're trying to get me. They're comin' out of the walls. The army's done something to me. I need you.
What'd he say that for? What made him say that? Strange, huh? Strange.
He was scared. He saw these creatures coming out of the woodwork. They were tryin' to get him, he said.
Turn on your right side.  How about the other "right?"  I don't understand you philosphers. You've got the whole world figured out but you can't remember the difference between right and left.
She hates me, Louis.
God almighty. What did you do to me?
Louis, you're a life saver.
I've got a problem, Prof. More Augus- tine than Kierkegaard, if you know what I mean.  I need to know about ... demons.
Yes.  I don't want them. I'm not looking for analysis or drugs. It's too easy to dismiss as some kind of psychosis.  It's more than that. I can feel it. I need you Prof. You're the only one I can talk to.
Our doctors are seen by appointment only.
What's your name?
I'm sorry but there's no record of a Jacob Singer in our files.
It's not healthy with it closed.
I'm not dead. I am not dead.
I'm going to have to move you a bit, just to check for injuries. This may hurt a little.
Gee, thanks a lot.
That help?
What do you think?
What happened to you?
And where do you think Jezebel comes from?
Yeah, but for what?
I must have been out of my head.
What's in here?
She looked good then.
Jake!
I don't know. One of these days, I'm gonna see Louis. My back's killing me.
It's still there, Jake.  Even if you never say a word about it. You can't spend two years in Vietnam ...
New York is filled with creatures. Everywhere. And lots of stations are closed.
Demons, Jake? Come on. They're winos and bag ladies. Low life. That's all they are. The streets are crawling with 'em. Don't make em into somethin' they're not.  It's the pressure, honey. That's all it is.
We're at Della's.
What does it say?
Look at me. I'm ice cold.
Look, I'm horny. Keep it in mind.  Love me a little?
How come? The army?
He said you didn't have one.
Why are you doing this to me? You can't just go away like that.
Don't!
What are you doing here? Are you all right? How do you expect to pay for this?  Everyone's looking for you, Jake. I dodged people all over the place, reporters, police. I don't know what you're gonna do.
It's amazing, you know, that a drug could change things like that, destroy a life and then give it back. It's hard to believe that the world could be so hellish on day and like heaven the next.
No! What's going on? Where's my family?
WHO ARE YOU?
So tell me ... am I still an angel?
That doesn't mean shit. Where do you come from, huh? And I don't mean Indiana.
You look upset.
You look terrible. What happened?  Jake ... is it the antidote?
Do what? I haven't done a thing.
Oh God!
Surprised, huh? I told you you'd know me. I've been tracking you for a long time. I just wish I'd spoken to you before tonight.
Next thing I know I'm on Rikers Island. Ever been there?  Suddenly they take me from my cell to the visitors room with those bank teller windows, you know. Four army colonels, medals up their asses, are standing on the other side. They tell me if I'll come to Vietnam for two years, no action, mind you, just work in a lab, they'll drop all the charges and wipe the record clean. Well, I'd only been in jail for thirteen hours and I already knew that Nam couldn't be any worse.
No shit. They had me by the balls. Next thing I know I'm in Saigon ... in a secret lab synthesizing mind- altering drugs. Not the street stuff mind you. They had us isolating special properties. The dark side, you know? They wanted a drug that increased aggressive tendencies.
I'd hoped I'd never have to. Just open your mouth and stick out your tongue.
Don't worry. Take it. It'll free your head. Come on.
I can't move.
Where's Wong?
Please come quietly.
Lennox Hospital.
No. No. You haven't had any visitors.
This is not a dream! This is my life.
Jesus Christ. How've you been? What's happening in your life?
It's almost like a conspiracy, huh?
I just need to talk.
Sorry. Sometimes I think I'm just gonna jump outta my skin. They're just drivin' me wild.
It's okay, Paul. It's okay.
I've seen them too ... the demons!
The army?
I'm so sorry. Obviously you haven't ... Dr. Carlson died.
That's nine to four, geek-boy.
That sucks. Why won't he go down?
Asshole that does not count as a kill.
I don't have all day, kid.
Forget the bridge, the shuttle's waiting!
It's locked!
What are you doing?!!
We can't lead him into the other hull!
Blowing the walkway? You come up with that yourself?
Where have you been?!!
Where the hell were you?!!
Everyone okay?
Hey! I'm not ready.
Goodbye, my love.
Hurry!
JUst don't go in there half cocked. You guys have a tendency to blow shit up and ask questions later.
Got it! Let's move out girls. Yllo go to Lab two and cover out backs.
Where is everybody? What happened?
Space Lab?! Wait'll I get my hands on Yllo.
Pull me in!
Outta here?
Kkinsa, Crutch is hurt! We need access to the shuttle's med-kit or he'll die.
What if you miss?
Hey.
That's why I'm here.
I couldn't save them.
Rizzo, you okay?
You okay?!
That's really funny.
Now hold on! We should hear her out!
Now that's just gross.
YeaH, GREAT IDEA! And I'll keep the big guy distracted with a blow job.
You're so bossy.
You're quicker than usual.
Boeman don't. You know I'm right.
No.
Barbie from hell...
I'm surrounded by idiots.
The cryo unit leaked. The computers sealed the room. No airborne viruses no hazardous materials. I've shut down the until. Alright, stand back.
I'll never experience my fantasy of three sex droids, two humans, and a Knofflapod. Damn.
You did good, Kay-Em. I'm proud of you.
Kay-Em we made it!
How do you know?
I gotta go back.
Hypothetically, how much are we talking?
I'll reset our course . . . 3 hours?
How do you open the damn door?
What have you done?
So, you're saying thse guys have like, lasers and stuff? They could hack him to pieces?
Guys, he's right behind us!
Cash? Or do we do this on a handshake and a promise?
And incidental damages, if any...
This is Matt Hooper...
Hey. Knock it off. I don't want to have to listen to this while we're out there...
Why are we way out here, when the shark's back there?
I never saw one that big.
What's that one, there?
What about us?
He's comin' up -- !
Don't forget these.
Sexy, hm? What was I before?
Be careful.
Mikey loves his birthday present.
It's three feet deep, Martin
You too, sweetheart...
Home... New York?
Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum.
Now tell me something I don't know.
He lost it on the way up.
You'd love to prove that. Getting your name in the National Geographic.
The best interest in this town would be to see that fish belly-up in the water with a hole in his head. You do the right thing. You authorize me.  Right there. Whatever it costs.
There's a fantail launch out there that won't make it beyond the breakwater.
...And it was Dartmouth Winter weekend, and she was Homecoming Queen, and I was her date; then she got into the fact that her family had more money than my family, and she was right -- her great-grandfather was in mining, and my ancestors were Yankee shipbuilders. So we broke up and I went home with some beatnik from Sarah Lawrence.
...Nothing.
Can you tell from that if a big man- eater is around?
We will. There's something I've got to find out.
You all right?
There's no limits to where he can strike, and we've had three attacks and two deaths in the past few days. It happened like this before, in 1916, when a Great White killed five swimmers at Jones Beach, in Long Island.
A 4th of July beach is like ringing a dinner bell, for Chrissake!
I hope we get some more help.
This has got to be one big violation...
What's that, a ship?
Quint...?
Y'know, I used to hate the water...
You picked her up on the ferry.
What d'you pay for a place just for the summer?
Look, I've got to talk to her. This isn't a contest we want the whole country entering.
You wanna call it a night after here?
Leg of lamb this time?
Who've you told this to, Lenny?
Take my car, okay?  You come with us, Lenny.
Hey, Squirt! You want to stow this gear or you want me to use it for ballast? It ain't good for much but bait.
Don't tell me -- 'Death Before Dishonor.' 'Mother.' 'Semper Fi.' Uhhh... 'Don't Tread on Me.' C'mon -- what?
That's disgusting! This is the largest, meanest, most vicious shark ever landed off Amity Island, and a known maneater!
I'm sorry, Martin. She's in a sick, terrible state.
Is that tooth here? Did anyone see it?
You ran eight miles today, Puppy.
Go Carole.  So, guess what?
So, what do you think we should do?
Whose idea was it?
Oh, I couldn't copy your work.
What's up?
So, it looks like you're getting pregnant-er these days.
I'm going to really start looking like a dork soon. Will you still think I'm cute if I'm huge?
Hey Junebug, when all this is over we should get the band back together again.
I don't like Katrina.
You're being really immature.
Why? Because I got bored and had sex with you one day, and then I didn't, like, marry you?
Did you put like a hundred things of Tic Tacs in my mailbox?
Why?
Mine too.
Well, yeah. You're the best friend I've ever had, even when you're being kind of evil.
Wait, what's that supposed to mean?
They could be utterly negligent. Maybe they'll do a far shittier job of raising a kid than my dumbass stepdaughter ever would. Have you considered that?
But they have a real lawyer and everything. I'm going to meet with them next weekend.
That was a mistake, Juno. Mark is a married stranger. You overstepped a boundary.
It doesn't work that way, kiddo. You don't know squat about the dynamics of marriage.
Shit.  Hey, can we give my kid the damn spinal tap already?
So, Juno. First off, how far along are you?
No, I mean in your pregnancy.
What? My eyes are not lying!
Like what?
Behold, good sir! The very first photo of your future child.
I think it kind of looks like my friend, Paulie.
Well, it can really only go two ways.
Junk?
It's the least I can do. What did you say your favorite band was?
So, have you and Vanessa thought of a name for the baby yet?
Madison? Isn't that kind of... I don't know, gay?
I doubt anyone's throwing us a shower.
Cute?
What?
Oh, okay. Like this.
I'm leaving Vanessa.
No.
But I thought you'd be cool if...
I... How do you think of me, Juno? Why are you here?
You should try Adderall.
I think pregnancy is beautiful.
Juno! God, you startled me. What are you doing here? What's wrong?
Oh my God...
Right. Well, Juno, your parents must be wondering where you are. You might want to head home.
Well hi Vanessa! What brings you to the mall today?
Do you need a large sum of money? Legal counsel?
Who is the kid?
Okay, this is no laughing matter.
Did you say you were thinking about adoption?
I thought you were the kind of girl who knew when to say when.
Excuse me?
I guess I wonder sometimes if people ever stay together for good.
What?!
Maybe you're having twins. Maybe your little boyfriend's got mutant sperms and he knocked you up twice!
So what's the prognosis, Fertile Myrtle? Minus or plus?
Is this Juno?
So, what was it like humping Bleeker's bony bod?
What are you doing here, dumbass? I thought I was supposed to pick you up at four.
Maybe they'll totally shit and be super mad at you and not let you graduate or go to Cabo San Lucas for spring break.
The Penny Saver sucks.
Look at this one "Wholesome, spiritually wealthy couple have found true love with each other."  "All that's missing is your bastard."
Check out Baby Big-Head. That kid is scary!
How do you know I'm so poisonous? Like, what if the adoptive parents turn out to be evil molesters?
Yum. This pretzel tastes like a friggin' donut!
That's her. That's Vanessa Loring.
She's gonna steal that kid for her collection.
I want a huge cookie. And like, a lamb kebob. Simultaneously.
God, you're getting huge. How many months has it been now?
I wish my funbags would get bigger.
Please do not refer to Mr. Conyers as "Keith," okay? My barf reflex is already heightened these days.
Oh, it totally does. I was there for her birthday about four years ago and it was like Lipton Landing. But you know, boys have endured worse things for nookie.
I wouldn't be so sure about that. He did it with you. He's a man now.
Yes. Heating and air conditioning.
Obviously, we'll compensate you for your medical expenses.
Well, I wanted to pick something gender-neutral for now. Once we get the baby, God willing, we can create a more decisive palette.
I think I'm leaning toward Custard in this light. I don't know. I should paint a small area...
You should read the book. I even flagged the "daddy chapters" for you.
That wall is going to need something. Maybe we could put our first family picture there.
What?
I've been just wondering if we're, you know, ready.
We're actually, finally doing this?
No.
...You can forget about 'em forever and then look at 'em and they're doin' even better than before.
Are you takin' the pictures?
Better not, or Early'd whip me.
What's this?
Did you settle things with Mr. Diebold?
How many times you gonna tell me that?
So what do you do Early?
This the book your writing?
How did he get away with it for so long anyhow?
That bad?
...They never caught that Black Dolya Killer, huh?
Now why is that?
Sure.
Wait a minute. You're gonna hustle me?
What I'm thinking is, we can drop down through Tennessee, across Arkansas and into Texas, from there it's a straight shot into California.  "We don't stop... until we hit the fucking ocean."
What did he sound like on the phone?
Jesus... They've probably got five bucks between them. Turn around.
...And all I'm saying is I think we ought to try and get along with them. That's all.
Stop being so fucking melodramatic! If it was murder he'd still be locked up or on parole, in which case he wouldn't be allowed to leave the state.
I'm scared. A week ago you would never have even thought to pick up that gun. This afternoon you're out there wielding it around like Clyde fucking Barrow, for Christ's sake! What's with you?
You gotta talk to her. She looks up to you, she'll listen to you.
Any word from that gallery?
...Soon as he finishes his thesis.
Ain't you done enough drinking for tonight?
Sometimes... Don't know why it is... I get so hot I can't stand it. I just start sweating like a dog. You ever get like that?
He's a killer, Brian... He's fucking insane.
Darlin' you were 'bout that far from spendin' the night at the morgue. You understand?
Who d'ya think you're foolin'?  I know you better than you think...
Could be.
Looks like somebody cut off his ring finger.
How many people have you had vaginal intercourse with?
How many times have you gone unprotected?
With how many people?
Well, girl. You tested negative for all sexually transmitted diseases and infections.
Oh man, it smells like butterscotch.
Shit.
It is right.
You know like in "The Wonder Twins" they share everything.
Yeah. "The Wonder Twins". You know.  Activate in the form of, a glass of water.
Well, those guys share everything, right?
But that's the thing. Girl's like it slow. They like romance. They like things to be sweet and romantic.
I watched her eat the watermelon. And all this juice started running down her chin and onto her shirt.
You wanna run by the park and see what everybody's doing? Get zooted?
That.
Nah.
Casper, where is he?
Yo, you think we killed that guy?
No I'm serious. Can I suck your tit? Either of you guys. I don't care.
I don't know. I just never seen girls that did that shit before. But I think it looks nice.
Sup then? Sup?
Hey.
I don't even want to talk, but I gotta tell you that when I first saw you last week, I, I couldn't stop thinking about you. You've been stuck in my head.
What is it?
You know what I want to do?
What do I want to do?
Because your a virgin?
Telly is at Steven's?
How many people have you had vaginal intercourse with?
No. I'm OK. Thanks.
Are you in trouble with the law?
I swear to God. Sometimes he barks. I can hear him straight off my arm. Ruff, ruff, he goes.
Hello.
You still mad at him?
Did you bleed?
Wish me luck.
Yep.
And you don't get shit out of it.
Yep.
Yeah. I've always hated that kid. He used to eat glue in like seventh grade.
No. I was just kidding.
Mom.
What are you guys doing?
Slow.
I've talked to a few people who say you and her were... friendly?
What's that supposed to mean?
That's crazy!  Why would I draw attention to myself like that?
What do you mean, no?
That's right.  I guess only the killer would know that.
You want me to what?
Sorry to ruin your trip to the city, but we got a real nut on our hands, Frank.
Debi Rutlege.  Female.  Caucasian. Twenty four.  Worked over at the Four Oaks Hotel.
No shit!
How is she?
I was with him the whole time until I got the call at the hotel.
A few people.
What do you mean, stand out?
Someone who's going to become an important part of your life.  I want to play a game with you.
Hello, Peter.
Very amateurish, Peter.  I'm surprised you would use such an obvious tactic.  I'm not an idiot!  Don't treat me as one!  I'll call you everyday... You get one minute, whether you put me on hold or talk is up to you!  Are you ready to play?
And -- what path is that?
Why not?
Just like who?
I'm sure there are other people who would be interested in what I have to say.
Huxley's quote also says, "his play is always fair and just."
What?
You're playing the Tarakoss opening.
Interesting concept.  I hadn't thought of that.  If you think about how Anton Berger plays chess you might get it.
Hello, Peter.
By that time the game will be over.
This isn't going to help, David. You're mother's dead.  You can't undo it.
Yes, I do.  I found your file.  I know what happened.
What's this?
Sure.  We've got a modem line hooked up with the data base in New York.
Now what?
There's three.  The first is 1983. Lionel Baines.  The Boston...
Computers.  That's how you got into Homesearchers records.  You can get into anything.  But why?  Why?
What scars?
I admit I handled it badly.  Sanderson wasn't going to talk to me... but you're young, attractive--
Kathy, please.  You're going to wear a hole in the carpet.
Do you like my dad?
I know he really likes you.
What are you doing up?
You mean, no prints but hers?
He tapes their mouths shut.  We found traces of adhesive around the victims mouths.  We're doing a chemical analysis for components, but it's probably a standard brand you can buy in any hardware store.
How long she been dead?
Only that you wanted someone from the institute to talk to Sanderson for some case you're working on.  What'd he do?
I'm busy right now.
As large as castles.
I know you're busy so I'll get right to it.  Did you know her?
As large as castles.  You are still light as air, one hundred men can't move me.
It's a commercial area.  No one lives there.
A shadow.  What's as big a castle?  As light as air , but one hundred men can't move it?  The shadow of the castle.  Are there any buildings that have the name Castle in it that cast a shadow long enough to fall across another building?
Did you send the car?
You opened with the English.  Lutz won't use it.  He opened his first game with it.
She went into town with Mrs. Lutz.  Did they get him?
Of course.  Yes, here it is.  Why, they're all the same?
Are you with the tournament?
I've always wanted to learn how to play chess.  I don't have the patience for it.  When did you start playing?
It seems like such a complicated game.
Sounds very violent.
That's a very personal question.
What are you looking for?
Can you go fifteen minutes without thinking about it?
She died in a car accident.
What is this?
Nobody could attack you.  You set your life up like one of your chessboards. You're impregnable -- but at the same time you've become trapped behind your own defenses.  You're cut off from everyone around you.
Exactly.  It's the key.
Hi.
The other night -- I said some things that maybe I shouldn't have.  I mean, you haven't known me very long and I can see how you thought what you did.
You're wife died.  You can't feel responsible for that.
Because I know what it says.
How did you know it was "carefully"?
You don't understand. I'm just so <u>relieved</u>. I was <u>sure</u> you'd turn out to be short and fat and gimpy.
We're almost married.
Take the western passage.
That's a better one.
You will go alone.
She was very faint. I was barely able to reach her.
<u>Why</u>?
From here, I must go alone.
They will hold Lyssa in the Center of the Vortex, the place of the Beast, where its power is greatest. No man can match it there. Lyssa must try to move toward us. For as we enter the Vortex and move closer ...
She must make a glaive.
Do not let the waters touch you.
I know the cruelty of such a fate.
Even by you?
You too are lonely.
I just remembered I have urgent business in this direction.
Not yet, my friend. It's your tomato that's dying.
They stand at the edge of the grave and make jokes.  Do you know who I am, sprout? I am Torquil, Lord of the forest. My men follow no man but me, and I follow no man at all.
It should be an interesting journey, then.
Well, I'm not impressed.
Lad, you have an unnatural desire to pay for things. It stunts the mind and shrivels the imagination.
Forgive me, my friends. I saw terrible things.
Go, join them.
We could reach it on fire-mares.
We must cover a hundred leagues before sunrise.
You're resourceful, my lad.  I tell you, one year under my tutelage and I could make you the Prince of Thieves.
A good thrust, my friend. Another second and there'd have been nothing between my head and shoulders but bad memories.
Make for the wall. I'll catch up.
Can't I come, too?
I am Ergo the Magnificent ...  ... short in stature ...  ... tall in power ...  ... narrow of purpose ...  ... wide of vision.
Not working? This nose? This nose works day and night. This nose has never loafed an hour in its life. This nose ...  What?  Impossible. This nose asleep while venison fills the air?  Where is it, boy? Tell me where it is and I forgive you everything.
What are you doing with my dear? Stop! Thieves!
Oh, my poor stew!
Passable, pimple, very passable.
My spells always go wrong when I am observed. Be gone!
He didn't join them. They joined him.
They'll trample him to death!
I do not want your power. It is hideous.
What news from our friends?
You know the voice.
Knowledge I wouldn't want.
We must reach the Valley of Reeds before the next dawn.
Kegan!
Go now.  Quell was wise. He knew that a man cannot ask more of his death than it help his friends.
But you would not stay with me.
You had a son.
You had left me! I kept silent out of rage.
Memory is no trick, it is a power. The power to see.
I cannot stop the sand.
What's that man's name?
She told them you wanted her things and that she wasn't surprised police looked for you! Can you believe it?!
I can't believe it! "Yes I think"... How she kids me! I can't believe it!  And did he pass your threshold or not?
At a certain moment I thought: maybe Leon would like working on his own? So he makes some little extras?
Tell me... The money I earn and you keep for me...
No, no.
Well, if the guy is far, in a car, and I know weather is going to be bad, rain for example, I think I would plastic the car, with a remote here. I shoot from the distance and if I miss I plastic.
Five minutes. Keep in front of the window.
Mathilda? May I come in?
Well... Then may you rent me your gear for the day?
...I'm going to kiss you.
Stop. Everyone is looking.
...You don't believe me, don't you?
OK, OK! Excuse me! How old were you when you had your first contract?
...Shit!!  We'd found him. We waited for him to get upstairs and he got out of the window.
...I'd like knowing what he's listening to...
Is there a normal 13 or 14 year old boy?
No, excuse me... It's the yogurt that made me laugh.
Well... 1... 2... 10... 100... 1000? How many, approximately?
...I had a girlfriend... A long time ago.  Before coming here, in my country. I was 14-year-old... We flirted like kids...  Her father didn't want her to meet me.  My family was not very respectable.
...That's awful.  I hope you killed, that asshole?
I don't know... Five minutes.
Huh? Move back, baby, I can't see anything.
Don't fear.
How are you, Miss?
...OK... Good.
Rinaldi... Rinaldi...  What region do you come from?
...Who sent you?
You'd better talk good, son, because, for the moment, I've got a quite bad opinion about you.  Norman smiles.
This smells good.
And your store?  What about your new store?  What about all your dreams?
I don't accept that.
Uncle Maurice -- I spent all our frequent flyer miles on a one way ticket here... I have a rented car outside, just listen to me.  Come back with me now, and if you still want to do something like this in a year -- maybe we'll plan a car trip across the country -- Gerald and I will come along --
Then it'll have to wait until I finish.
A.P.B.... He isn't breaking any law.  He's a grown man... He can crawl on his hands and knees to China if that's what he wants to do.
Look, I'll see if anyone has spotted him recently.  If I get any information, I'll call you.
Are you a preacher?
What are the odds?  Do I have a fifty-fifty chance of surviving the operation?
You should start slow and easy -- fifteen minutes a day.
You thought I sent them?
Have I forgotten something?  Is this a special day?
What it is -- is the truth.
Why there?
Maurice?
If I die, you'll know where to look for me?
To where?
From where?
A marriage certificate?  Who the hell carries their marriage certificate around?
I'm going to drop off Tandy at the station and then drop you back.
You know what, I can play baseball with my brothers when I'm bigger.
Anyway, Big Billy needed another player so he yelled into the stands.  'Who can play baseball?' And there was a little voice that yelled out, 'Me, I can play.' Everyone turned to see a little boy standing with a glove.
Three thousand miles?... How many times does twenty go into three thousand?
What are you saying?  This story is too big for this paper?
What happened?
Where?
When are you leaving?
I'm walking there Kris.
Adelle told me, your writing is going well.  The Crusader for social issues and all.
I haven't been too punctual with the rent.
Are they standing?
We do the operation after I finish. I can't risk not finishing... I thought you understood what I was doing.
Why in God's name did you fly all the way here then?
She knows you love her Mr. Parker. She knows now.
You're in pain.
You're going to have a lot of work to do when I get back.
Hello, Mr. Parker.
What's your shoe size?
I've always wanted a watch like that.
What do you want?
Everything's ten dollars, and there's no alcohol.
No alcohol. You gotta get something else. Everything's ten dollars. What do you want?
Sparkling apple cider?
One drink minimum per show. Everything's ten dollars. Now... tell me what you want or I'll eighty- six you.
Umm. We can stay in the car for an hour if you want. But I really have to go then. It's your time.
Mind if I use the bathroom?
Want a drink? I'm having one.
I think about four weeks, and I've got enough for about two hundred and fifty to three hundred dollars a day.
...or a girlfriend, but if you have some free time... maybe we could have dinner.
You OK?
I'm from the East. I went to college, did an arts course. I now live in Vegas. I think of it as home. I came here deliberately to carve out a life. I was in LA before, but I'll come back to that later.  The tough times are behind me now. I can deal with the bad things that happen. There will always be dark characters. But my life is good. It is as I would want it to be. So, why are you a drunk?
It wasn't so important to me. I mean, he never asked me why I was a hooker, and that was impressive. I really liked him. So I decided to just play my part. I mean... it's good to help someone once in a while, it's a bonus to being alive, and that was my plan... to stay alive. I suddenly came to a decision.
Let's face it, what the fuck are you doing in Las Vegas?
How long have I been here?
Me neither.
Don't you like me, Ben?
You can never... never... ask me to stop drinking. Do you understand?
Want a drink? Great nap. Wanna go out tonight?
Ben?
No. I think you're talking about you. I'll tell you right now that I'm in love with you... but, be that as it may, I'm not here to force my twisted life into your soul.
Giving you money makes me want to come.
I like women who wear mismatched earrings.
Here's my speech...  ...I know this shouldn't be acceptable to me, but it is. Don't ask me why. I sense that your trouble is very big... and I'm scared for you... and so I'm doing what I think you need me to do. Falling down in casinos is little stuff. It doesn't bother me. It has nothing to do with us.
What was that all about?
Maybe I should follow you around and ask one of your tricks what it's like to sleep with you.
I'll be back home around three. If you're back by then we can watch TV or something... I guess what I'm saying is... that I hope you are back when I get home. Please be careful.
Years ago, in LA, I turned a trick on Sunset and Western. The guy was polite and didn't argue about the price. He parked his car and I took him to a house that I had an arrangement with. A fat Mexican woman was watching a TV and I told him to give her the twenty for the room. There were three or four small naked children playing on the floor and we had to step over them to get into the room. The room had a bed and a dresser. He lay on his back on the bed and I put a rubber on him and sucked him for a while until he was hard and then I eased on to him. About twenty minutes later there was a knock on the door and it was the woman saying our time was up. I felt kind of guilty because he hadn't come and I offered to reason with the woman and get another ten minutes, but he said it was all right and began dressing. When we were ready to leave the room he stopped me and... hugged me and kissed me on the cheek. He gave me an extra hundred as a tip and went back to his car. I remember being relieved that I wouldn't have to work again that evening.
I've missed the best sun. Why did you have to pawn your watch?
You know I love you... yeah?
What did they look like?
Where are you staying?
You have been lonely?
It is, after all, Sera, my money.
Where have you been?
But it's a top three school --
Why would I kill my husband?
Were you with another man?
Elle, I can't. You don't understand.
I'm not having an affair with Enrique -- you know a Delta Gamma would never sleep with a man who wears a thong! I just liked watching him bend over to clean the filter --
Uh, yeah, because the bitch shot him.
Okay -- Ms. Windham, when you uh arrived back at the house? Was your father there?
Miss Windham, can you tell us what you'd been doing earlier in the day?
Yes, Your Honor. Had you ever gotten a perm before, Miss Windham?
Huh?
All I know is -- it's not Brooke.
Good work today, Ms. Woods.
You're hitting on me?
You're not going up there.
Yes?
Yes?
You're asking the wrong girl. I'm with my guy eight years and then one day it's "I met someone else. Move out."
You showed up Warner in class? You're supposed to be showing up Sarah.
I'm her sister.
Hi. Sarah Knottingham.
I believe her, too. I don't think she's having an affair with Enrique.
Warner can't even do his own laundry.
I'm a bitch.
It's Elle!  Guess what I'm doing right this second?
Picking out my wedding dress!
Josh proposed!
Oh, how sweet! You made friends with a nerdy girl.
You have Stromwell.
And make sure you read the footnotes in Levinson's class. That's where all her exam questions come from.
Okay, if Brooke didn't kill the guy, who did?
Aside from that.
A) He's an old man with a really big penis. B) She never told me I was fat. And C) Victoria Principal sells on that network.
The what?
Projecting joy is not my job.
So now you're -- ?
Oh, my God!
I miss you guys! The people here are so vile! Hardly anyone even talks to me unless it's to say something that's not nice. Law school sucks!
I don't know --
It's pink.
Wait -- my social events schedule is missing.
Of course.
I completely agree.
Elle, believe me, I never expected to be doing this, but I think it's the right thing to do.
I have to think about my future. And what people expect from me.
What're you talking about? You're not here to see me?
Well, yeah, but --
Thanks for the backup.
Did you ever take Mrs. Windham on a date?
Where?
So, I hear the tart from California shot Heyworth.
Elle?
Is it a Kappa?
Dumb magic.  Giant smash peewee.
More fun win battle?
You go to lady now?
You're magnificent.
You... you're a beast!
Then why hide behind a mask?  You are ashamed!
Jack... Oh, Jack... Help me...
Your moans seem almost pleasurable, my dear... developing a taste for the lash?
When you are ripe for my pleasure, I will enjoy the harvest.
I'm pleased you're not troubled by the prospect...
What was that?  Did you hear that?
Now I want to live forever.  I've never felt so strong or happy.
To be strong and free... that is all I desire.
Course not.  I no flum here.  I come flum Cathay.
No, wait... please... listen...
Well, bygones're bygones, I always say.
Damnation!  Codfish and cockles! Gammon and trotters!  You've bested me, Jack.
I've laid eyes on no mortal but you this day, Jack.
But... but, why?
If ye want more tricks, I'm your man, but for big questions ye must go elsewhere.
Think there be truth only in beauty, lad?  If you've the courage to ask and take care to avoid her terrible claws, Jenny Greenteeth has the answers you seek.
Here now.  Toss her this when you've the chance.  Jenny Greenteeth can't resist the sight of herself in a glass.  She's terribly vain.  Praise her beauty and you'll lull her sweet as a babe in a cradle.
I'll do what I have to do, for Princess Lili's sake!
By the grace of God.
Shhhh!
Damn them!
Tricks, is it?  Why I'll trick ye! Ungrateful whelp!  I'll sour your milk and bird droppings'll fall from the sky wherever ye walk.
How do you plan on finding this here castle, if ye don't mind me asking?
Worse than the battlefield.
Oona tells me the raven has roosted for the night on a sharp stone spire some half a mile distance.
Twould appear other travelers precede us.
Shhh!  Not so loud, mayhap he'll hear ye.
Certainly understandable.
Is she... dead?
Never knowing when it takes a turn or changes course.
We'll never find the Baron's castle.
Don't like the feel of it, Jack.
Tells you something 'bout him what lives there...
A fine mess this is... horrid, nipping creatures... What do we now, Jack?
There aren't enough arrows.
Water doesn't burn...
There isn't much time!
Aye.  We're good as inside.
Easily... The question is, can we save ourselves?  Be a shame to win the battle only to lose the war.
Can't we move any faster?
He's getting away!  He was at my mercy!
Ever wondered why Jenny Greenteeth said you needed the fastest steed on earth?
A good day for singing...
Where's your joy if you cannot sing?
You must find the ring... It completes the cycle; answers the riddle...
Keep me belly full, Jack.  Kill us another worm.
Barely living, from the looks of it.
Well done, lad.
Someone like Floki... or Squarefoot... or --
Greetings, my lady, the green wood is honored.
The Baron is a frightful man.  They say he's an ogre.  He wears a mask so none may see his face.
Oh, dear.
The napkin will keep.  I'd rather not be alone.
Oh Jack, mightn't I touch one?  It would thrill me so.
What happened?
They tricked you.
He did run?
Tis the truth.
What have I done?
It's the Baron's damnable work!  Too cowardly to stand and fight... he used you to save himself.
What?
No!  Don't let go... you mustn't!  I love you!
I can't see a thing.
We seek the ogre, Baron Couer de Noir.  He slew a unicorn and plunged the world into eternal winter.
What's this now?
Well spoke, boy.  You have discerning taste for one so young... Just who might you be?
Dear lad, what does winter bespeak but death?  It is a time of mourning.  This calamity is a curse. Something wondrous and beautiful has been taken from the world.
He chopped off the horn and left the rest to rot.
Where do I find the Baron's castle?
Princess Lili, Godwin's daughter. She was with me when calamity struck, but after I could find no trace of her.
Tis not the time to speak of cheer.
I live in an abandoned fox den neath the roots of a thousand-year-old oak.  My bed is pine boughs and rabbit skins.  There's no need of weaponry to keep the maids away.
And charmed, of course.
I had no thought of offending you, Oona.
I'm promised to another!
Please...
What care I for the human heart! Such a soft, spiritless thing it is. I prefer the hearts of hawks and wolves; fierce and free and keen as steel!
What's she doing?
Hello, Jack.
Each fit for a hero... My uncle fashioned a hammer for Thor.  Twas he named it Mjolnir.  Grandfather forged Excalibur... You won't ever see finer craftsmanship.
Is he a friend, then?
Forgive my blood haste, Jimmy Squarefoot, but I want no more surprises from Couer de Noir.
Lost?
Dad's disappeared!
Oh, honey.  There's not much to do there. I mean, it's all work.
Oh.
Red.
I'd be more comfortable if he slept in the guestroom.
Are you his friend?
Why?
I'm living here while I build another house.
I had them in my pocket.
You have to ask like that?
I'm hungry!  Where's my dinner?  Who ate my dinner?  Huh?  Who's in trouble now?
I don't know.
I can't even take a shower here.
Huh?
I'm coming in.
Why are you so uptight?
What's the point of this?
I thought I was helping you.
Okay, but then we'll just be friends. Okay?
Well, he doesn't need to worry.
He won't leave my room.
Mr. Dokos says that your father missed his height envelope by six inches.
Mr. Stevens.  One of your neighbors is adamant your home has exceeded its approved height.  He's filed to have construction stopped immediately.
That would take weeks.
Peter Webber!  Right.  Quite the spotlight on that guy.
Maybe...?
Oh.
Listen...maybe I can get you a year.
I didn't know there would be a quiz, George.
Well, I feel better about this now.
Sam?
Is Alyssa here?
George, this is the third time.
I did warn you.
I'll be around to check up on you.
Because I live there.
Your nose ring comes out of your nose. If you've got them in your nipples, they come out, too.  And there's no make-up at my house.  No glue sniffing.  Huffing. No pills, no grass.
You'll have money when you work.
No one would blame me if I left!
Where is it?
You can't make me do a thing.
Oh, so you're in the big shit now!  Child abuse.  People go to prison for what you just did to me.
I was holding for someone.  That wasn't even mine.
I'll have to pay him back.
I took some of your Vicodin.
What are you now?
I wish you had told me then.
If I asked you to stop, would you?
I don't know what that means.  What kind of problem?
I still don't know what that means.
And you told Mom today?
We're all dying from the start.  I just got picked for Advanced Placement.
I'd eat a lot of red meat.
What kind of house?
No one's really said four months is all you have, have they?
I aimed high.
Your kid was down around Diver's Cover again, smoking pot.  I didn't write him up...told him I wouldn't tell you...
What are you doing?
You're inconsiderate and absolutely devoid of emotion!
Four days.  I left to think.
I'm going to tear down the shack and build my house.
Forget it, really.  I'll survive.
Hey, hey!
We're fine.  Turkey sandwiches.
I was here six years.  And I only hated two.
I was up on the roof this morning, tearing it down and it struck me as strong as anything ever has.  That I'm happy today.
What is it?
Didn't you once dream you could lick people well, though?
Oh...with his ear infection!
I'll find something that won't kill them.
It's been a while.
Do you know Alyssa thinks something is up with us?  She's giving me crap about being away from Peter and now you're trying to do the same thing!  What no one seems to realize is that Peter isn't there!  He's not there!  And when he is, he isn't!  So, if you don't want me here, or you don't want my kids here, just tell me, George.  I'll stop coming.  But it won't be because of Peter.  It'll be because you asked me to stop.  Say what you need to say, because I'm not leaving until I hear it.
I thought we were helping.
That thing about I was the most, you know, beautiful person you had ever known.  What was that?
It sounded like a pick-up line.
I kept thinking about it, what you said... I hope you were trying to keep me away fro the sake of me.
Peter left me yesterday.
Been thinking?
It'll take you like twenty, thirty minutes.
Then you tell me, what just happened?
I'd love to drive through New England in the Fall.
After the kids are back in school.
I've been helping for the last few days. Weeks.  Sam's working.  I told you Sam was working.  I mean, he really is.
I was talking about our marriage.
Where are the kids?
Do it now!
I've missed you guys.
I guess I could teach you some things.
You're sure about this?
I read the letter.  You read the will. He wants you to keep it.  To live in it some day.
Why do we have to get up and eat with you this early?
Adam, that's not true!
She's doing just fine.
I'm talking about a haircut.
Yeah, but what about me and Ray? I didn't see our names on that pardon. You said you were gonna put in a good word for us.
No, but...
Yeah...
You know I trust you, Claude.
I got it... boss.
For the kind of money they charge here, you'd think they could hire somebody to actually wash the dishes.
Season tickets to the Yankees. Right there on the first base line.  What's wrong, baby?
Engagement ring!
Yeah, that side of the family has all the looks and none of the brains. I hope he don't mess things up.
Can't you remember your own name?
Ten dollars. But I need it to get home.
Where they taking us, anyway?
What are they gonna do to us?
That's some long green.
No, tell me what's so funny.
The Negro League don't pay so good. And you're always on the road. That don't wash with Daisy.
At some point a man's got to get serious about his future. I'm sure you have no idea what I'm talking about.
How would I get a loan, anyway?
Nice meeting you? You've been here before, haven't you?
Oh, I don't know, maybe because our lives depend on it, I just sort of thought you knew what you were doing!
Guess we better get going, huh?
Fuck that cheap-ass watch --  I mean, how the hell are we gonna get home without any money?
What do you think you're doing?! The man's been dead for two seconds! Don't you have any respect?
What ain't there?
Life?! How long is life? We were just walking back to the truck. We didn't do nothing! Fuck life!
So?
What a second, you've been in here since you were thirteen?
I kinda lost track of how many people we killed that night. Must have been 15 or twenty -- not counting women and children. It was a real bloodbath. All that screaming...
No, man. I want you to have it.
That's why we won't take the train. Cookie showed me where there's a farm house. They got a boat there.
Your daddy must have been a helluva guy, a deep man, a wise man. Sure wish I could have met him --
You still got that map?
The appeal was denied. Then Daisy went and fell for Maynard. They're engaged to be married, can you believe that?
What'd you say?
I know these trees all look the same, but I'm getting an awful familiar vibration from this one right here. You sure you know where we're going?
That's right, we'll get off at the next stop. The train's pulling into the station right now.
Allie Reynolds. He's my boy.
I know people.
Can't be worse than any of these other fools.
Crawfords.
Let it go, Claude.
One of the new kids said they're farming those acres just north of the swamp. He said he saw a crop duster flying around the place.
He said they keep it parked out behind the barn. Can't be that hard to fly a plane. Lots of people do it.
Take that back or we ain't friends no more, Claude Banks.
You're a sucker. I'd have taken that deal.
I know, but since we're talking, I thought I'd mention it.
What?!
Then you're lucky I came along. Doesn't take a visionary to spot a golden opportunity like this. Now help me out of this trunk.
Back to New York for starters.
You sure it was him?
I can't do it.
Sure would like to see the house that Ruth built one more time.
Are you trying to tell me after all this time you finally have a plan for busting out of here?
It's too late for plans.
What is that?
At least he didn't kill Santa Claus with his bare hands.
We don't need no fences at Camp 8, boss.
Man, you really bummed me out. That's a terrible story.  Nigger, you crying?
What do you think about that?
Mama?
Rayford, I wanted so much more for you than this.
I can't take that, mama.
They gave me life, mama.
Is everyone here?
Stay calm, Ray. We'll find him. Claude! Has anyone seen Claude?
Wait for the firemen!
Respect? Well, isn't that progressive.
What's going on here?
Hey, Ray, Goldmouth don't believe me. Ain't it so they got trains up in New York City that run under the streets?
Alright Willie, I think I got everything. I'll talk to Dillard, see if I can get up to the infirmary and check up on you. Make sure they're changing your diapers regular.
How you doing? We're looking for Slim.
You don't have to drown that fella, Spanky. You already scared him half to death. He didn't know who he was fucking with.
Where'd you get this?
He should have thought of that before he denied me my birthright.
Is this a joke?
Now will you get in the flask?
I knew it. He's finally retiring.
Um, excuse me, we're having a private conversation here.
I am concentrating. Where can we rule?
"Let the sin begins" -- that was a good one.
Hello, Cassius.
No!
Wow. What... what did she look like?
Hello... yes, he's here with me now... I don't know if he's hot, he's my son, you perv! I'll call you back...  Oh my God, I will call you back, goodbye.  That was my friend, Michelle, she says "hi."
How did you see me?
I gotta help her. I gotta help Dad. I gotta help everybody.
Well, Mommy, get me to the big apple cause I'm gonna rock that town like a hurricane.
What's Nicky doing down there?
Where is he? He's late.
So far, so good. Now what?
You'll be alright. Go on. Big day tomorrow. Don't forget to do that sleep thing I told you about.
You can't do jack shit... unless you learn your evil powers.
Yeah, but Joe was coming here anyways. Just go back to Earth and enjoy your records and the Hall of Fame and the beautiful family and all that.
I mean... tough break.
I don't care what kind of mood you're in at the start of that song. When it's over, that mood has been altered. Wow. Great shit. What's next?
Who is this, Metal-lick-a?
To do that Cassius and Adrian have to come back through the other way.
Dad, Adrian's got the whole city after me. He's always a step ahead. What am I gonna do?
Uh, I'll do my best, Dad. Do you have any advice at all for me?
Thanks.
You got it. Could you maybe not tell anyone about this?
You know what was in Hell when I came down here, Cassius?
Boogerland!
There's our man.
Looking for the chief.
This don't look good.
Come on. One more time.
So I was driving to work today, and some bozo in a Cadillac cut me off...
So I followed him...
Please. You got to.
You got the wrong window again, man.
I don't know, but I like it. Say. Your glasses are nice. They make your eyes look sparkly and big. It's fun to look at them.
I'd love to have a dog. But I go to school full time. It wouldn't be fair to the dog.
Your juicy, heart-shaped ass.
No.
I think I'm floating.
..."The Devil?"...
We're going to Jersey?
That just hurt a lot.
I'm a Sandman!
Are you too startled? Am I too removed from your ken?  I'm neither machine nor man... but a perfect fusion of the two... and better than either.  No human sculptor could match this greatness... don't you agree?
Hiding? Yes! Hiding, hiding.
Answer the question!
How did they get in here?
But you don't know, you just say what everyone says. "One for one. One for one."
No, but at least I wonder sometimes -- instead of doing that "one for one" song of yours. You sound like a sleepteacher with a stuck tape.
Did you ever see Francis-8?
You missed something special.
You should have been with us in Nursery, Daniel. I'm positive I recognized him --
Now there's a few who could have been his seed-mother.
Who invited you?
What's going on, Logan?!
He's the one. You too. I remember. He was in a hurry. Just a face job. Dark hair, I said. Then he killed Doc and you grabbed me -- and the machine blew up and I ran... I ran.
Well then...?
Yes... probably he was renewed?
You felt sad. What's your name?
But you put yourself on the circuit!
And now?
About what?
I'm not armed.  Well?
You shouldn't even think such things...  And you picked a strange person to say them to --
What Quad do you live in?
Maybe... sure...
Of course.
Why tell me?
About running, dying what?
Where did you get that?
And then you killed him, right?
Are you here to help me?
If you did know, you'd tell me.
I hate outside! I hate it!
Don't ever let go.
You're right... it must be near now. We'll find it.
What does it mean?
...But I still have the choice...?
What are we promising him? What can we possibly give him?
And Sanctuary?
What does that water do?
And... and how were you grown? Inside your mother?
Come with us.
We don't get many Sandmen. I think we've only had one other since I've been here.
I like your face. Would you mind if Doc took a picture? I'd like him to give your face to somebody else.
My name's Holly... Holly 13. In ancient times they said my number was unlucky. Do you believe in luck?
How did you get here?
What's beyond this place -- do you know?
May we stay here for a while? We'd like to rest.
I don't know who you are. I'd like to thank someone.
Good... You up for a drive?
Just goin' up'ta "Tops"... Maybe the "Ten Pin".
This rod is a fuckin', embarrassment, Carl. Whatiya burn in this thing, "V"?
You want somethin'?
Do you always sleep here?... In this room?... Both of you?
Why not?
Like you'd get if it was hand held.
Now we'll see what this son of a bitch is up to.
You recognize that guy?
I was here yesterday.
Okay...
He'll kill us.
In pornos?
You liked it.
That's his name... Andy. Our ticket out of here.
I'll set it up for tomorrow night. You'll meet me at his place at eleven o'clock... Don't drive there... Take a bus... Make sure no one follows you... His address is easy to remember... It's 2224 Deep Dell Place... It's a white stucco job on the south side of the street... I'll be upstairs with Andy... The back door will be open... That leads into the kitchen - go through the kitchen to the living room - there's a bar there... At eleven fifteen, I'll ask Andy to fix me a drink... When he does, you can crack him in the head... Okay?
Are you kidding?... I've got so much on Andy, it isn't funny.
Look at all this shit... I know a fence... he'll give us money and get us passports in exchange for this and the car...  We can go anywhere.
Dick Laurent?
But Dick Laurent is dead, isn't he?
What night is that?
You don't look so good.
We saw you that night, Pete.
Repeat that, Bill.
Of course, it's Madison!!! Who else could it be?
If he's not Madison, then where's Madison?
You just gonna let him go?
Now, Mack, what's the situation?
Yeah, Mack?
When he went to work, right.
Pete, can you tell us now, anything about this?
I won't ever tailgate.
What's your axe?
Headache, huh? Too much sun, I guess. You want to come in?  Still got forty- five minutes outside if you want it.
What is it?
You're up early.
We will.
What the hell is going on?!
I thought you were getting me a drink?
I don't remember... Anyway, Andy's okay...
Did you see that about the guy who chopped up his wife into a million pieces?
Andy would go for this, don't you think?... Firing squad, definitely.
What happened? Somebody givin' you trouble?
Thanks, Mr. Eddy.
You like pornos?
How ya doin', Pete?
Look... It's late, Mr. Eddy... I ...
I don't think so. Where was it that you think we've met?
Sheila?!
Well, there's certainly nothing wrong with that meal!
Not even a radio?
What about those men we met this morning?
Two years!?
A what?
Found in Asia!
Uh-huh.
Wait a minute, you expect to be knighted for finding that soupbone?
Yes, it just shows-  I don't know why I'm talking to you. I don't know you. Who are you?
I didn't care for 'sister' last night, and I don't like 'Lovey' this morning. My name is Lovett - Alexander, P.
I see.
Have I?
You know, that's what makes the whole thing so funny. A guy like me starts out in life as a plumber - an ordinary, everyday, slew-footed plumber - and by the use of a little brains, mind you, he builds up a gigantic institution, employs thousands of people, becomes a great civic leader. And then the crash comes - and overnight he's the biggest crook the country ever had.
I don't know why I associate with you, Mr. Barnard - or Mr. Chalmers Bryant - or Mr. Embezzler - or whatever your name may be.
Barney? Why should I? Never! We have nothing in common. Hmmpf, Barney! What effrontery!
There you are!
Oh my, isn't that pretty! What is it?
Hey, hurry up, you slow-pokes - I'm starved!
Oh - that! That can wait. Nobody's going to run off with it.  Say, I've got to get busy. I want to show this whole layout to Chang.  So long. Don't you take any wooden nickels.
I say, will you have a cigarette?
Yes. I've just been talking with the porters. They're going to take us. We've got clothing, food, everything. Come on!
All right! If you insist on being an idiot, I'm not going to waste time coaxing you.  How about you?
And the wine - excellent.
For a man who talks a great deal, it's amazing how unenlightening you can be.
But Mr. Chang, all these things - books, instruments, sculpture - do you mean to say they were all brought in over those mountains by porters?
Well, it must have taken-
When was all this?
Well, is it?
One moment. You say the High Lama is the only one who can give us any information?
Not for years. Shangri-La will keep her youthful indefinitely.
You must prevail upon him not to attempt the journey. He could never get through that country alive.
I'm sorry, but we have no doctors here.
You shouldn't be looking at the bottom of the mountain. Why don't you try looking up at the top sometimes?
We were just going to bury him when you came along.
In that event, we better make arrangements to get some porters immediately. Some means to get us back to civilization.
Sit here, near me. I am an old man and can do no one any harm.
And be sure that none of the natives get in.
George, what are you going to do?
Hello, George.  Cigarette?
Oh, I'm feeling far too peaceful to be concerned about anything.  I think I'm going to like it here.
Don't you ever want to see what's on the other side of the hill?
Well - I heard that if you want a man's wife, she's yours, if he's got any manners.
Porters?
For heaven's sake, Bob, what's the matter with you? You went out there for the purpose of-
George - you're behaving like a child. You haven't opened your mouth in two weeks.
Why not? What's going to stop me?
Well, I - I really don't know what to say. Except that you must be completely mad.
What else can I think after a tale like that?  Good heavens, Bob, things like that don't happen today. We're living in the twentieth century.
I knew there was a reason I hated this place. I'd give half my life to fly over it with a load of bombs just for what they've done to you. How do you know the things they told you are true? Did they show you any proof? All this talk about the Lamas being hundreds of years old. How do you know? Did you see their birth certificates?  I can't believe it, Bob. A bunch of decrepit old men sit around and dream about reforming the world. And you, Bob Conway - two-feet-on- the-ground Conway - want to join them. It's horrible.
Besides, I - I don't feel like making that trip alone, Bob.
You can't take her away from here!
Because you can't. Do you know what will happen to her if she leaves Shangri-La? She's a fragile thing that can only live where fragile things are loved. Take her out of this valley and she'll fade away like an echo.
The clothes?
Bob, can't you get them to wait for us? They're leaving us farther behind every day.
Where were you hiding?
That fellow got on at Baskul.
What do you suggest?
Imagine having all that fuel there, waiting for us!  George, something tells me our journey is just beginning.
Huh? I give it up. But this not knowing where you're going is exciting anyway.
A man whose life was empty!
As a matter of fact, all I saw was a little boy whistling in the dark.
Yes.
There are so many questions I'd like to ask you, I hardly know where to begin.
Father Perrault! I envy you. I talked to him last night.
You know, if you keep on asking that, we're not going to get anywhere. And don't ask me why.
It would serve you right if you were left behind.
Couldn't you arrange to make a little less noise?
I don't care what you've got started. Do you want to go?
I'll make some for you!  You will come today?
No. just peace on Earth.
What's so funny, cadet Cowan?
It'll make sense later?
Sorry, Cowan, I found out literally just before the ceremony.' Apparently you're to report for further review.
Bull... loney- Sir.  I'm sorry.  Sir, I'm sorry. Sir.  I just, I find it hard to believe that it didn't come from you.  I mean, everything here comes from you.
Look. I don't know why.  I could guess, however.  Maybe it's your attitude.  Or that you're not even close to a team player.  Or that you always seen to think you know more than your supervisors.
Cowan.  Do you ever think that maybe, just maybe, other people might be right and you might be wrong?
You do?
Little more burn on the perimeter-they weren't roasting smores here. Dig out this hole a little.  Cmon, I know it's late, but the sooner we get it right, the sooner we'll all be home.
I wasn't scared...
So... lemme get this straight.  We got the use of all sorts of technology from all sorts of other planets.  We got information no one else in the world is privy to.  And we're in a 1986 Ford LTD about to go look at an insect?
I know, but we're on a college campus...
Hey, I was workin' her.  I was workin' my thing.
What'd you do before this, anyway? Wait-- let me guess. Ice sculpture? Rock?
Kay, um... how, uh, fast does this thing actually go ... ?
What?
Why did Mikey leave Nazca?
The radio show?
"Perhaps we shoulld take a lesson from our dinosaurs..."
Great.  Fine.  Listen, why don't we call the pentagon, maybe they'll take you back with the new age well wishers.  I'll stay here and go extinct with the dinosaurs.
I know what you're saying.  And I'm telling you I don't trust him--
Maybe they didn't get here.  Maybe they've been here.
What the hell does that mean?
What are you doing?
The kid looked desperate.  I figured...
Oh yeah?  Well if you're suddenly such a good samaritan, why didn't you file a departure report, like you're supposed to?  You know how many rules you've just broken?
So... now what?  Cattle call again?
Did he say where?
Wouldn't happen to be the Lincoln Memorial, would it?
Listen to me. You're holding something very very dangerous. You've just iced 350 of your pals--
We're with the immigration and Naturalization Service, Intergalactic Bureau.  We monitor all-alien activity in and around Earth and its enveloping atmosphere.
Which way?
How's Dee?
Hard to tell.  I hope not.
I'm getting a trajectory...
And they're buying it?
And get this: you know how humans evolved from primates?  Well guess what the dominant life form on planet evolved from?
Now, what are we looking at?  Keys.  Look at them all.  Why do we have them?  Mr. President?
A good question.  And a simple answer.  No more hunger.  No more smog. No more overpopulation.  No more war.
Agatha --
No.  Follow him.
He's here.
Oh, God...
Please, I want to go back...
I have to go back.
I'm sorry, John, but you have to run again.
Just some guy... they found.
About who?
I'm so sorry... I just want him back... I want him back so bad...
I put you away --
You set your patients on fire!
I know you're in a hurry, so I juiced up the nano-reconstruction around your new eyes.
Kill type?
That's an old one.  One of our first.
Hence the expression...
Huh, we don't seem to have her data.
Looks like she was a neuroin addict like John Doe here, but I show an address history that includes the Beaton Clinic.
Has the observer from Justice shown up yet?
You understand, John, that the minute Precrime goes national, they're going to take it away from us.
Somebody named Leo Crow.
I'm out of breath!  I'm a fucking fugitive!
You can't run --
Got him in the Foxhall.  4421 Gainsborough.
Somewhere near the capital?
Look at the kid.  In this one, he's on the left of the man in the suit.
Go ahead.
The victim's name is Leo Crow.
I show time of occurrence, Friday at fifteen-zero-six hours.
As I recall, they outlawed compression firearms in the District ten years ago.
It was Iris Hineman.  She developed the Precogs, designed the system and pioneered the interface.
Really?  You've never been inside?
At least now you -- and I -- have the chance to make sure that kind of thing doesn't happen to anyone ever again.
Well, hey, you didn't have to come all the way down here.  For you, Chief, I make housecalls...
She's a precog?
C'mon, Rufus, you've been busted twice for felony hacking.
I tell you what.  I do this, I get to keep whatever images I get from her head.
I scored a goal!
Okay... now let me time you.
You're alive?
... and that I needed his help.  It wasn't so bad really.  I sang him a song, made him laugh, bought him a pretzel.  I took care of him.  I made him happy.
Look, believe me, I know it's hard, but you gotta do it --
Tell me, who was it, set this up?
Let go of the gun.
Yes, I'm afraid that would be from the Doll's Eye.
You don't seem all that proud.
How can you avoid a man you've never met?
Why?
Where?
That's all, huh?  Just walk right into Precrime, go into the Temple, somehow tap into the Precogs, and then download this Minority Report...
Oh, God, what did you do?
John said something about him being set up because he "found out about her."
Lamar, do you know the reason why John came here to work with you?
Sir, the press conference is starting.
Oh, it's all my damn business now, Lamar.  Investigation of a supervising office for a capital crime falls under federal jurisdiction... so as to rule out any possibility of conspiracy.  He's my suspect.
I don't wanna say over the phone, but I think we may be chasing the wrong man.
Good God.  What was that?
I'm thinking someone got away with murder.
Precog Deja Vu...
So there is a way to fool the system?
Of course, it would have to be someone with access to the Prevision in the first place, someone fairly high up --
This is Evanna, the team pilot.
People, if you don't let the spyder scan you, we'll have to come in and arrest you.
We could have lunch together.
My name is Danny Witwer.  I'm --
This your work?
Cream and sugar.
No, but then I don't talk to John that much anymore.
That was our apartment.
It was nobody's fault.
You said in your divorce papers that he tried to kill himself.
Lamar Burgess thinks that you left John because he lost himself in Precrime instead of you.
To prevent a murder.  Sooner or later, he's going to contact you.
Nice to meet you, Wally.
They've never been separated before.
Hey. I don't know, I don't want to know. Far as I'm concerned, you're a good kid. I got news, though, without you here I can't keep on your friend. I got enough people pretending to sweep.
Yeah.
He'll be a minute, hon. You want some coffee?
Yeah, snifters are for cognac --
What's the matter? You ain't got no snifters in this motherfucker?
Yes, sir.
I can take you down there.
Are you sure?
Thank you very much, sir.
As far as...?
I don't get it. What do you do?
Is he cute?
He's great, right. Is he great?
I know.
It's daytime.
You're not my daddy.
I gotta go, baby. I love you. Tell mommy I called. You be a big girl and be careful when you're alone.
No. What kind of bachelor party?
Oh my god. What happened?
Bobby, this is a plumb gig. It's a bunch of young agents and it's at a restaurant. It's gonna be easy and we'll make a lot of money.
I feel weird asking him.
No way that cocksucker's driving you.
I never promised you anything.
Don't you get it? I don't want to leave. This is who I am.
It's already been a hell of a night. Where you been?
Well, you look it. You win?
Yeah.
So, when's the drop.
How bad is it?
It's fixed. That's the only way to win. A sure thing. See that horse. The blaze.
Last time, maybe, with the Puerto Ricans, but these were nice Jewish boys.
You're not driving Jess no more. Two strikes, Bobby, and this last one was big. The bachelor's father goes to my schul.
It's my fault. I send you out to watch scum drool all over the love of your life, then I wonder why you seered. It's my fault. The tooth is on me. But no more. I'm 'reassigning' you.
Who the fuck do you think you're talking to? This ain't a fucking democracy. You want out?
I got a way we make everybody happy.
I don't need a few days. I'm gonna settle down with Jess. She's through dancing. We're opening a restaurant.
That's him. Now you all know the drill, right?
Jesus Christ, where the fuck you been all night? You look like you got shit out in the gorilla house.
Hi. I, uh, think that's us.
I'm not sure. All I know is the account is Cardiff Giant.
Nah.
Spa?
Yeah... Mmmm, that sounds good... Uhu...
So, it was a draw.
So, it's not a winning record.
Of course I don't want you to bring it up to him... But if it comes up...
Yeah. Page me. You know the number?
So I'm like, 'Maybe I'm not on the list cause I'm not a fuckin Persian.'
He implied it.
Sorry coach.
I still can't believe you missed the fucking team bus.
What? Did she say something?
I don't know.
I'll get the girl.
How much is it?
What are you doing?
You know this guy?
This shit's sketchy. Why do they drop us in the middle of nowhere to have the guy we're supposed to meet come meet us just to tell us we have to meet the same guy somewhere else?
So is this the drop?
Yeah.
Why you gotta make everything difficult?
Fuck you. Go then. I'm taking the car.
He said it's being arranged. He said Jimmy will know.
We're not getting whacked.
Nothing, man.
Whatever. We're here. We may as well go to the penguin house.
All the more reason.
Wanna bet?
Float me a hundred bucks.
You coulda picked up a tab every once in a while.
Let's just go get guns, I'd feel better.
Look. They're together. You telling me this ain't a set-up?
Hey, boys.
Fine, fine. And you were...?
I don't wear a white wig, I don't carry a gavel.
You want to come splash around.
What's up, man.
You look big, man. Diesel. You been lifting?
I'll get you the list of videos, if you don't mind, I'll offer the other passengers a beverage.
Yes.  Would you care for another one?
Don't drag my ass into this --
I'm not saying shit to neither of you.
What the fuck, 'Red Dragon?'
See you later.
I can't yet vouch for the amount, unless you want me to sit here and count.
So you're our own private guy?
Yes. You're going to New York.
Don't worry. I get it.
I never intended to test you two to that extent, but you both came through. I should've been informed there was a flag on the play, but I'll take that up with Ruiz. I made a few calls back East. Those punks weren't tied in with anyone. As for the Welshman, he wasn't in on it. He was just plain dumb. As for you, Ricky, your draw will go towards a new carpet cleaning van.
And here I thought you flew in some out of town muscle. How's it going, men?
I'll get it.
What they call you?
Not this boy... I ain't fighting their war. I got my own. Right chere. Heard tell you're a good man to know.
You ain't bullshitting me, is you, boy?
Okay, baby. Now you outfitted. You ready to tackle the street?
Ain't nuthin' in the world to give you that real deep cool. Like girl. You there?
1, 2, 8 hit, didn't it?
It's me or you, ain't it, Pops?
Man live by his rep.
Who the hell are you?
Man, what do you want?
If you ain't trying to punk me, what's your hype?
What the hell for, man?
Man, I'm studying in the man's book. I don't dig half the words.
You pitch, baby; I'll ketch.
Sure, white man throw us a bone and that's supposed to make us forget 400 years.
Little.
I want to, Bembry, but I can't.
I want to, Bembry, but I can't.
Brother Bembry, can we fix it so our loudspeaker is heard on the street?
Do you?
You are now Benjamin 2X.
Considering today's standards of animal raising and curing meats, I don't fully understand the restriction on pork.
You're from Detroit, near where I come from. You majored in education at Tuskegee. You're studying nursing and having trouble with your family.
Did you hear what I said?
I'll be away a lot.
Talk about what?
"Los Angeles, UPI: Elijah Muhammad, 67-year-old leader of the Black Muslim Movement, today faced paternity suits from two former secretaries who charged he fathered their four children..."
No, what's the matter with you? Wake up! Are you so dedicated that you have blinded yourself? Are you so committed you cannot face the truth? Bembry is the editor of the newspaper you established. Ask him why your name hasn't been in "Muhammad Speaks" in over a year? Ask him why you rate front page in every paper in the country, but not a single sentence in your own.
Dear heart, you have to help me. I'm raising our kids practically by myself, while you're running all over the world. You don't know how many times the girls ask me when is daddy coming home?
We need you too!
Malcolm, they keep calling, threatening us. I'm going crazy, when is this going to stop?
I'm gonna try and get some work done tonight.
No, that won't be necessary. I'll be all right.
I assumed...
Brother Minister, what is wrong?
Do you know what a friend you have in Jesus, son?
Just what are you saying?
You left one phrase out. Another educated Kneegrew said to me and I quote: "Brother Malcolm oversimplifies the dynamic interstices of the Negro subculture." Would you agree?
Let him finish.
And like a fool I believe it.
'Bout every other night, Red.
I better not come in.
Baby, I'll call you tomorrow.
It's the same questions, Mrs. Little. Since the death of your husband --
How many you turning out?
I'm with you, Brother Minister.
Sheeet, you ain't. I had aplenty.
That's alright. Baby, take your time. Sophia's not going anywhere. I told you to walk, don't run.
Well, all right, then.
Don't you know, you can't hump the Bogart.
I'm tired of always playing the cops. I wanna be Bogart sometimes.
What did you do, Homey, palm it?
Then I put him to bed and pour talcum powder on him like a baby. He gets his jollies off.
You have a rather checkered past. Mr. Creasy. Your Interpol file is six pages long.
[Senor?]
A lot of people are looking for you.
It's Santa Muerte. Death worship. The religion of La Hermanidad. There's a curse on you.
Where does he live?
Deal.
[Daniel.]
[Do you know who I am?]
[I'm professional. I just do my job.]
Who's he?
[He has a tattoo covering two-thirds of his back. He is part of the Brotherhood.]
[Yeah.  Yes.]
[I don't know him. I saw the opportunity and got lucky.]
[And I had my men ready.]
[There was no ten million dollars.]
Is it loaded?
How does it affect you?
When did Mexican Customs start getting smart?
You got a secondary search and you had a gun.
Everything happens once if you live long enough.
You did something on impulse?
What are you doing here?
Samuel Ramos. Owns one of the plants in Juarez. The Jap car industry is in the toilet. He's trying to persuade Ford to partner with him. I think he's in trouble. He asked me if I knew anyone he could trust.
I've heard of it. Never happened to me though. Maybe the firing pin's off.
Stomach's gone. But... okay.
Frank doesn't take to most people. Do you speak German?
In between you can take Mom shopping and to lunch. Does that sound alright, Mr. Creasy?
No.
We're taking a different way home.
Did you like school, Creasy?
You're fast.
Doesn't matter. I always finish second.
In the West, it's one wife for one husband, but different cultures have different rules.
Remember you asked me what state I was from?
What's so important in Los Angeles?
You don't drink like you used to.
I know because I go in your room and check the bottles.
That's strange. Frank was a no-show. Not like him to miss a ride.
Yes, she told me. Do you have children, Mr. Creasy?
You should know they're tenacious when they want something. And Pinta wants to be friends.
I don't believe you.
Last night. Do you know something?
I know you need to please Lisa. An ass like that is hard to find. Good bodyguards are even harder.
And Lisa will be able to save face. We won't be the only family without a bodyguard.
[I need a driver to drive Samuel, the father.]
I like him, Mom.
[Then what do you have to lose?]
He'll deliver more justice in a weekend, than ten years of your courts and tribunals. So stay out of his way.
I told you she wasn't attractive...
You wanna have a drink before we start dancing?
That big girl that was sitting in front of us with the skinny friend.
Boy, you're getting to be a real drag, you know that?
Where you been, for Pete sakes?! I been looking all over for you.
We gotta whole pot inna kitchen. We give you a plate-a your own.
Marty, let's go downna Seventy-Second Street area tonight.
Hello, Lou, Angie come in yet?
Who told you that?
I gotta pain in my left side, and my leg throbs like a drum.
I wake up this morning, I hear the baby crying. So I wake up. I come in their room. That girl is shaking her hand atta baby. I said, "You brute! Don't you strike that baby! That's my son's baby!"
She's a witch, that one. I tell you what happen yesterday?
Ufa!
So I am an old garbage bag, put inna street.
Well, what Marty you think is gonna be here in this house with a girl?
Oh sure.  This girl is a college graduate.
You will see. A coupla months, you gonna be an old lady, sleeping onna couch in her daughter-in-law's house.
I only got about three bucks on me now, but I just live about eight blocks from here on the other side of Webster Avenue. Why don't we walk back to my house? I'll run in, pick up some dough, and let's step out somewhere.
So I was telling you, my kid brother Nickie got married last Sunday. That was a very nice affair. And they had this statue of some woman, and they had whiskey spouting outta her mouth. I never saw anything so grand in my life.  And watta meal. I'm a butcher, so I know a good hunka steak when I see one. That was choice filet, right off the toppa the chuck. A buck eighty a pound. Of course, if you wanna cheaper cut, get rib steak. That gotta lotta waste on it, but it comes to about a buck and a quarter a pound, if it's trimmed. Listen, Clara, make yourself comfortable. You're all tense.
No, Marty, please...
No...
Waddaya doing tomorrow night?
What happened, Angie, was that we thought we were just gonna go for a short walk, and then we thought we were gonna come right back, but we got to talking. Listen, Angie, I want you to meet Clara...  Clara, this is my best friend, Angie. I told you about him.
So I'll call you tomorrow.
Siddown, siddown. You want some chicken? We got some chicken in the ice box.
No, thank you, really, Mrs. Pilletti.
Herbie! Wadda you doing here?!
Oh, that's a sad story. And her husband is that little fellow, works in Peter Reeves.
What time is it?
So what are you gonna do tonight, Marty?
What?
So I'll die without a son.
Blue suit, gray suit, I'm still a fat man. A fat ugly man.
I'm ugly... I'm ugly! I'm UGLY!
She looks a little old for you. About thirty-five, forty years old?
What are you talking about? She's a nice girl.
So these two girls come over to the bar...
Waddaya mean, Ralph?
I'm with a girl, Ralph.
Your kid brother got married last Sunday, eh, Marty?
Well, there's the Stardust Ballroom. That's a kind of a big dance hall. Every Saturday night, it's just loaded with girls. It's a nice place to go. You pay seventy-seven cents. It used to be seventy-seven cents. It must be about a buck and half now. And you go in and you ask some girl to dance. That's how I met Virginia. Nice, respectable place to meet girls. You tell Marty, Aunt Theresa, you tell him, "Go to the Stardust Ballroom. It's loaded with tomatoes."
He says okay, it's all right Catherine comes here.
Hello, Aunt Theresa.
On accounta...
We didn't tell her anything yet. We thought that we'd leave it to you. We thought you'd put it like how you were lonely, and why don't she come to live with you. Because that way it looks like she's doing you a favor, insteada we're throwing her out, and it won't be so cruel on her. Do you want Tommy and me to stay here with you?
Well, I'll tell you, Aunt Theresa...
Okay.
That's very nice-a you, Aunt Theresa.
Tommy...
Reckon so, but we been boozing all day and you work up an appetite.
Yes, O'Reilly?
What are you going to do with him?
Is there any reason why we shouldn't know the name of it?
I don't think I should have opened my big mouth. Sorry, Ho-Jon.
What's that?
Never mind. Forget it.
Never heard of him.
How come nobody knows about him? And you do?
I thought we were heading for trouble putting on all these trinkets.
I have a tent to myself.
Oh, I'm used to it. What makes me sore is how they behave towards you.  They ought to be grateful to have you.  I certainly am.
I was just asking...
If we had closer relations, there wouldn't be any misunderstandings. That's where a football game would help. Between your outfit and mine.
The hell we won't! You bastards pulled something, I don't know what, but we've been beating you without him. Ane we'll go on beating you!
Gimme three.
You betcher ass, Dad.
Pierce! That soldier requires immediate attention. I'm a surgeon and I know.
I'm going to play poker until three a.m. or until the patient is ready for surgery. However, if you'd like to operate on him yourself right now, be my guest. I get the same dough whether I work or not.
Well, it's still pretty much in the talk stage.
I think I heard about that.
I only wanted to know what she's like in the sack. Do those big boobs hold up or are they kind of droopy?
Oh, certainly, Sergeant. My name is Captain George Limburger, and this is Captain Walter Camembert.
I think I've seen this nut somewhere.  Haven't I?
Black capsule.
Don't worry, son. That's Captain McIntyre, and he's the best chest surgeon in the Far East and maybe in the whole U.S. Army. He'll fix you up fine. Your daddy saw to that.
Please!  Face it, Colonel, you don't have us, we have you. Your boys blew this case, we bailed you out. We figure we ought to hang around a day to check the Congressman's kid, and we also figure to play some golf. So if that's okay with you, we got a deal.
Best thing you could do for all of us is grab some sack time.
It's in pretty deep.
Never mind the conversation. Do it, Dad.
But we'd have to break his leg or something to keep him out of the game for good.
All of them?
Major Burns is far from satisfied.
I've noticed that both nurses and enlisted men address you as 'Hawkeye.'
Hey, Knocko, I got those pictures you promised to look at of my kids. You too, Wilma. It won't take a minute.  You can see them too, if you want.
What's the matter?
Thank you, Captain Pierce.  It's been so long.
How did you get called that?
Very happily married.
You'd think now, with only six weeks before they ship me back home, it would be easier. But it isn't.
He should come to now for a while, but he's got so much dope in him by tomorrow he won't know fact from fantasy.
What do you care? You'll be on your way to Japan.
Two-man job. How much blood has he had?
Be the longest short-arm inspection you ever held!
What's wrong with him?
Officer all sleep now, yes? And I go wash clothes.
Pain bad, Ho-Jon?
The blonde dish.
Stop acting like a colonel, Henry. You know Trapper wouldn't sock him without a good reason.
Dammit, Radar, wait till I call you! Tell Major Burns...
If I can make a suggestion, Coach.
Thank you, Spearchucker. I'll certainly take a look at these. Where the hell did you ever get that name?
Those two big guys were tackles on the Cleveland Browns, and the redhead played halfback with the Rams.
Well, there's one big satisfaction.
Planes mostly. May take a crack at rickshaws. How does the direct approach work over here?
What's the bastard really like?
Ease off on those tapes, and let's see how much it bleeds.  How is he?
Don't mind the Colonel. He hates people.
Hello, John.
Can I help you pack?
You know, I had a crazy dream last night. It was about you.
But here's the funniest part of it all. I was the fella up there doing the marrying. You know, the Justice of the Peace or something . . .
Three hundred thousand? What makes them do it, Ann? What makes them come and listen and, and get up their John Doe Clubs the way they do? I've been trying to figure it out.
Better let me talk to him.
Oh, somebody else sitting there?
Tomorrow night, before a crowd of fifteen thousand people, and talking over a nation-wide radio hook-up, John Doe will announce the formation of a third party.
That's good.
What for? I gave you fifty just the other day.
And the fifty's all gone, huh? Who's the ten for?
Oh, I'm sorry, Ma. Oh, don't pay any attention to me. I guess I'm just upset about all this. Gee whiz, here I am with a great opportunity to get somewhere, to give us security for once in our lives, and I'm stuck. If I could put this over, your Mrs. Burke can have six babies!
Yeah, I don't know. I simply can't get it to jell!  I created somebody who's gonna give up his life for a principle, hundreds of thousands of people are gonna listen to him over the radio and, unless he says something that's, well, that's sensational, it's just no good!
That's your father's diary, Ann.
Yeh, D. B. Oh, just cleaning out the dead-wood. Okay.
The letter from John Doe.
You made it up.
Now, then comes the drama. He meets discouragement. He finds the world has feet of clay. His ideals crumble. So what does he do?  He decides to commit suicide in protest against the state of civilization. He thinks of the river!  But no, no, he has a better idea. The City Hall. Why?  Because he wants to attract attention. He wants to get a few things off his chest, and that's the only way he can get himself heard.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Lemme get this through this lame brain of mine. Are you suggesting we go out and hire someone to say he's gonna commit suicide on Christmas Eve? Is that it?
So you think this is worth a thousand dollars, do you?
Hurry up, Pop.
Yes.  What's he doing here?
And you! Start pounding that typewriter. Oh, boy! This is terrific!  No responsibilities on our part. Just statements from John Doe and we can blast our heads off.
Yeah, but it's got everybody sore. Ads are being pulled-the Governor's starting a libel suit-what's more, they all know John Doe's a phoney-and they insist on seeing him.
Listen. If that guy lays an egg. I want to get something out of it. I'm getting a Jane Doe ready!
Now listen, Ann-he can't possibly get in without our seeing him. I'm watching the side door and the Colonel's out front, so stop worrying.
Well, nobody asked yuh.
Colonel!
Had any schooling?
Baseball?
Ann! Say, why didn't yuh-
Hey, wait a minute, Mr. Doe!
Well, I'll be doggoned if over forty people don't show up. 'Course none of us knew what to do, but we sure got a kick out of seeing how glad everybody was just to say hello to one another.
You don't have to-Why, we're with you, Mr. Doe. We just lost our heads and acted like a mob. Why, we . . .
And then we started to find out about a lot of other people.
No!
Hey, pretty nifty, huh?
I gotta figure some way out of this thing!
Tear down all the fences. Why, if you tore one picket off of your neighbor's fence he'd sue you!
Jitterbugs.[9] Close shot: JOHN and the COLONEL.
Join the John Doe Club.
No, I never read the speeches before I make them. I get more of a kick out of it that way.
All right! Now, supposing a certain unmentionable worm, whose initials are D. B., was trying to use that to shove his way into the White House. So he could put the screws on, so he could turn out the lights in those lighthouses. What would you say about that? Huh?
Go down to the office and arrange for some radio time.
Look, D. B. I'm supposed to know my way around. This John Doe movement costs you a fortune. This convention's gonna cost plenty.
Miss Mitchell, do me a favor, will you? Go on out and get married and have a lot o' babies-but stay out o' newspaper business!
What are you doing up here then?
Yes! I was paid! But the-
It's good to see you. Sit down.
She isn't?
Oh!
I bet you he'd know how to say it all right. And me, I get up to it and around it and in back of it, but, but I never get right to it. Do you know what I mean? So the only chance I've got is, well, if somebody could kinda give her a warning sort of, sorta prepare her for the shock!
Say, who's putting up this dough?
Spencer of the Chronicle .
Out the window! Something just flew by!
Is there a crowd in the street?
A sea-gull? What's a sea-gull doing around the city hall? That's a bad omen, isn't it? 
Hello, guys.
Floor seats.
Dinner's on you.
This SWAT guy might be a good idea. He may be able to take a little pressure off you. I worry about you.
Perhaps for his own reasons he entangled me in this... situation.
Tell me what's wrong.
Tell my dad I'm sorry about the watch.
You signed out twice.
The suspect came in shortly after the bank opened. Botched robbery. A teller hit the silent alarm. He took seven hostages. Shot one -- the guard. He's still alive. So far he's asked for...
That's right.
Anything on Korda so far?
I want a plane waiting at the airport. I'll tell them where I want to go when I get there.
For now that's all.
Satisfied?
That's not going to look too good on your service record.
How do you feel after a shooting.
With your qualifications you must have had a lot of offers. Why here?
How did you like Toronto?
No, no, no...  She's from Hoboken.
We see each other every couple of months.
No. Actually I think it's fucking crazy, I don't know if I could do it.
You know the ten commandments?
You tell me.
To save lives.
We need the 4 and 6 to finish to first and second.
Ronnie... Yeah, so.
The 6 horse is last.
We won!
Is it always like this?
What the fuck is going on.
It might have happened no matter who was up there.
Is the hostage injured?
I know how you feel, Ray.
Same thing happened to me, man. She cheated on me, but I forgave her. You know why?
Ray, if you walk out of here with me, I'll get you a job.
This baseball player you're going out with...  He's no good for you.
Please. I'm begging you.
Hey.
Maybe you should be.
Oh, hell, forget it. This won't work.
Something I guess I can't have anymore.
It's already started.
I've been craving that stuff all week.
Stay here, don't move.
That's right. We've got to bare it all. Here and now. 'Cause I think I'm finally ready to go for it...
Scott...
...at the top of the stretch it's Cozy Girl in front with Backtrack coming on... Cozy Girl by a length, Backtrack closing...
Stay up there, Girl...
Are you going to make this hard for me?
And a car.
You know I can't assign you to this. You're much too close to it. You were much too close to Sam. The department will take care of it.
They have nothing to do with this --
You're in there.  Everybody dies, you go with them --
Your life that bad?
You were right.
You don't have much sex up there in the real world, do you?
It's time to wake up.
The patterns were moved around, but they weren't changed.
God creates man, man creates technology, technology creates God.  End into beginning.
The new world.
Where the hell are you going?
How long 'till we can eject?
Where you plugged-in from?
We can be there in fifteen minutes and rip him off the system.
Because why the hell would you be interested in a program that allows people to live inside your machines?  I mean how much profit could there possibly be from owning the universe and selling space in it to people who are dying, or people who are just God-Damned sick of this world --
The only way to eject it is from the inside.
Then what's with all the staffing programs in his account?
There was no need to kill her.
Someone you have to get back to?
We worked together on the inside. You were on my programming team --
To see how long it would take for me to realize.
But you were with me.
What's so funny?
Don't know what you're talking about.
Standard, modern, upscale --
WE CAN'T BREAK FREE!
Ay, yi, yi, yi.  The legend speaks of a Master Warrior who lives on the planet Phaedos... This is the only person who knows the secrets of the power.
Wow.  Sand.
I heard that!
... What's happening to him?'
Release the power with the power.
SABER TOOTH TIGER!
Release the power WITH the power.
Ay, yi, yi!  The Rangers are going to be CRUSHED!
PTERODACTYL!
NINJA CRANE ZORD!
... Nothing.
NEW POWER COINS!!
009843... 42... 41!  WE'RE IN ALIGNMENT!
There goes the neighborhood.
Just shut your gap!
But boss, what about their parents?
Don't you ever have anything nice to say?!
Six become one... the combined forces of the Ninjetti.
I am the mighty ape!
You own a hotel, sir?
We're asking you to go to prison.
One fuckin' year ago I had ta hit you up for train fare. Now I can buy the fuckin' train. And I ain't even a fuckin' Sicilian!
Torrio ain't like them guys. He thinks like an American. You'd like him, Charlie. He'd like you.
We have a commission. If there's a dispute over territory, the commission decides.
Maybe you better hear what I got to say first.
Up down. Down up. It's the same. You see things through both eyes.
Scotch is a very valuable commodity these days.
Tommy Reina. Good pal. Better partner.
Shane was a friend of yours?
It consoles the bereaved family ta see the perpetrator take his load of juice. We try to oblige.
How much longer we gotta be shut up in this fuckin' sweatbox?
You ain't even a man yet.
I think Maranzano's talkin' a hell of a deal.
Does Maranzano have to kiss you on the lips before you'll take his goddamn money?
I'm sorry, but I sleep better when I know I'm with the winning side.
Inside, they were talking of you.
Come on. It's Christmas. At least stay for breakfast.
Same here.
Why do you bother with perfume when you smell like this?
Charlie?
You fellas got names?
Meyer just finished the books.
At least Masseria plays by the rules. Maranzano thinks he's God, and the rules don't apply.
Well, good. Woman like that you don't have to keep an eye on.
We're going to Atlantic City for the honeymoon.
We need to put together a meet for the whole country. We all got the same problems. We could talk. Meet the guys we don't know. Lift a few with the guys we do.
Like Don Maranzano.
After all this time I'd think you'd know me better, Meyer.
It's just that Maranzano's the only bastard I ever heard brag about gettin' audited by the IRS. He came out clean, so he thinks his shit don't stink.
Why's it gotta be Tommy!
You're a smart boy, Charlie, but there's somethin' you ain't learned yet. A man needs a family.
This business is about taking risks.
He'll think something's wrong I ain't there.
You and Vito are gonna pull that payroll job. Right now.
You got no fuckin' choice. You might be able to stay alive, but you're never gonna win the war from these fuckin' rat holes.
Then perhaps you need to know me.
If you give him the chance, Lansky will betray you like Judas.
At first, it will hurt you. But you will come to understand and we will be strong together.
I will be the Boss of All Bosses.
Tell it to the Calabrian. Tell it to the Jews.
Forget it. That's past.
Why didn't you tell me that Maranzano had made you an offer?
You think this is a coincidence? Next week half your customers will be buying their Scotch, our Scotch, from Maranzano. In a month, he'll be in Scotland talking to my distillers, because you can't move product. I'll be out of business, and you'll be working for Maranzano.
So we're gonna knock 'em both off?
I'm a hard guy. I done more jobs than alla you combined. And I never said no. Not once. But dammit I don't understand why the hell we gotta kill our friends!
Take any one ya like.
You're fuckin' crazy.
When he first came in to the sleep lab?
How do you get from <u>here</u> - to <u>there</u>?
The thing is, I'm responsible for the way he's acting. It's the nightmare juice. It's got to be.
Yeah, I know - Picasso. <u>Guernica</u>, right? That's what everybody says - although personally, I don't see the resemblance. What are you drinking?
<i></i> I beg your pardon?
DEATH!!
Back? You're sending me back?
Death! Thank you!
I don't want to be rich. It's just a trap!
No. I want to give him <u>more</u>. I want to give him a massive dose.
Wait a minute. Stu Miley, right? Boys and girls ...Mr. Stu Miley, in the <u>house</u>! <i></i> This is an <u>honor</u>. We see a lot of nightmares down here, but yours are like <u>caviar</u>, man. You da <u>shits</u>!!
The monkey, of course. It was his idea.
Meaning me, of course. I'm referring to myself. You have to assume Monkeybone would be a pretty lucrative franchise...
What are you watching?
We'll hop a plane tonight. An island ceremony. An Abba Dabba honeymoon!
Can't you give it to me later?
How was it? I don't recall.
An hour ago. <i></i> I tried to prepare myself, but I didn't know he would be like, like <u>this</u>. I can't even bear to look at him... How about you? You're okay?
It's too soon even to - <u>talk</u> about that!
Kimmy! What's the matter?
Hypnos?
I'm so sorry, Stu. I <u>wanted</u> to tell you what was going on. I really, really liked you.
<u>He</u> got an E-ticket. Where's mine? <u>When do I get</u> <u>to wake up</u>??
I've been stuck down here for <u>months</u>. Somebody had better start paying attention, or I'm gonna - I'm gonna <u>kick ass</u>!
Pact? Pact? NO LIFE SUPPORT??
Stu, you have my <u>absolute confidence</u>. -- DEAD MAN! DEAD MAN WALKING!!
OH, THANK YOU! THANK YOU! TH-- <i></i> Something went very, very wrong here.
He's taking her to the land of Death, right? So all we've gotta do is...hitch a ride! <i></i> Stop shaking! I'll protect you.
Excuse me, sir.  I just wanted to thank you for helping me get into my building yesterday.
Who told you we deal drugs?
I wanted to ask you something.  Those motorcycles across the street ...?
The motorcycle gang?  Don't they deal drugs and rape young girls?
You know that guy in the pictures you saw?
Where to?
I came to New York to visit my youngest daughter.
She would have come to the airport to meet me - she wanted to - but ... but, she just started a new job and, well, I guess no one drives here.
This is one-way street.  You go down the block to the middle.
Here you are, Senator. Not a bad desk, either. Daniel Webster used to use it.
Give you something to shoot at, Senator--if you figure on doing any talking.
Right up there over the Vice- President's chair--the four in the front row represent the four big news services. You've met the press bunch, haven't you?
But it *isn't*?
What's he bringing pigeons for?
Well--who d'you take this time--Paine, Bill, Carl--or McGann?
Will you go chase an ambulance!
Oh--yeah--
Where?
I won't take it! See? I won't be party to murder. See? Steering a poor dope up blind alleys for that grafting Taylor mob is low enough. But helping that dame cut him up in little pieces besides--nobody's gonna make me do that. No, sir.
Well--let's dig up the preacher, kid.
All I know is--he said to me tonight-- "What does your wife think?" My wife. Thinks we're married--
The war's on!
Of all the times! Of all the times! Two months to the end of his term-- and Foley has to go and die on us--
Otis!
Good. Are the newspaper men at the hotel?
I *can't* wait, McGann! You go into that room and tell Jim Taylor and Joe Paine that I give them *one more minute*--
Oh--oh.
--a *boy ranger* a squirrel chaser-- to the United States Senate!
You couldn't understand! Listen, Ten Thumbs, I'll be on my way to Washington in half an hour. Whatever happens, I'm all ready for this Ranger of yours. Never mind how. You'll get your instructions from Ken Allen here. It isn't anything you have to do. I wouldn't trust you to lick a stamp. Allen'll do it himself. You just use your *high office* to help him get it done. Understand?
Thanks, Governor--*yes*! Do you mind? His head--Ma'll take the tail.
I did. What about it?
He's the greatest *American* we got, too, Dad. Can tell what George Washington said--by heart. An' "Boy Stuff's" got the swellest stuff in it.
No, *sir*! You couldn't do better, Dad.
Yes. Come in.
Maybe you'd like to come along and watch, Governor? Jefferson's done a wonderful job with that leg.
Washington!
Just a minute, I better make sure.
Has the gentleman the effrontery-- standing there convicted and in disgrace--to try to force the postponement of that bill--?
Ma's told me about it a thousand times.
I know. I suppose, Mr. Paine, when a fellow bucks up against a big organization like that, one man by himself can't get very far, can he?
I mean, sir--if I'm going to stay in the Senate--I ought to know what I'm doing--at least, I ought to try to study the Bills that are coming up--
Yes, I was--
Yield *how*, sir?
Ah, now, that's better.
Mr. President--I did not say that Senator Paine was one of those Congressmen I saw. If the chair please, I will deny that Senator Paine *saw* Taylor or even knows him--
Can't you?
Yes! I've told Senator Paine for twenty years--
What is it?
*No*!
Is--is something the matter?
One of those sightseers--you know. You see, I--gosh, I've never been called absent-minded or... but there it was all of a sudden--looking right at me through one of the station doors--
I don't believe I've been so thrilled in my--oh, and that Lincoln Memorial! Gee! There he is--Mr. Lincoln--looking right at you as you come up the steps-- sitting there like he was waiting for someone to come along--
The Capitol Dome! Lighted up!
Tell me, Miss Saunders--what time does the Senate--uh--what do they call it?
Convene--that's it--yes. I got to pick up some of those parliamentary words. I imagine a fellow can get pretty lost in the Senate without 'em--
I had a lot to do with that little press conference last night--
Pardon me. Senator Paine decided this *with* you?
If I were *triplets*, I couldn't--. Look, Senator--let me give you a rough idea. A member has a Bill in mind--like you--a camp. Right?
Fine. Now, what does he do? He's got to sit down first and write it up. The where, when, why, how--and everything else. That takes time--
Tonight.  Look--uh--I don't want to seem to be complaining, Senator--but in all civilized countries, there's an institution called *dinner*--!
Committee.
A committee of the majority party leaders. They decide when a Bill is important enough to be moved up toward the head of the list--
But you've had beautiful country all around you. You've just had to life up your eyes!
I take it your--your parents couldn't-- uh--
No! Gosh! I better get moving here, Miss Saunders--  Everybody else calls you just plain "Saunders." Why can't I?
Saunders. That's better.  Good morning, Saunders. Hello, Saunders. How's the bill coming, Saunders--?
Clarissa. Oh. Uh-huh.  Well, Saunders--let's go--
Do you mean all--look--look we'd better open them up--see what they say here--look at the money--what does it say--"Dear Senator Smith, I would like to come to your boy's camp and I shine shoes at the station and here's nine cents." Oh, isn't that wonderful. Look and he signs it. "Yours truly, Stinky Moore." Isn't that marvelous?  Say--have I got some paper here?
I know. Don't tell me. It was a wonderful party. Your suit went over big. And she looked beautiful, and she gave her hand when you left her-- and said--"Thank you, Mr. Smith." Oh, but it was the way she *said* it. You like to fell through the floor--Horseradish!
Well gee--how--how've you been, Saunders? I--I haven't seen you in-- . I suppose--now that you're married--
No. That night--I--well, *you* know-- I was pretty--. No--Diz is a--a sort of brother, that's all--
I don't care *what* you've done! Don't quit. Don't grab a measly chance like this to save a few pieces--other men could--but not you. As long as you lived, you'd remember you ran out and threw this country of yours to the jackals--!
Jeff--wait--they want you to speak!
Tell us about yourself, Senator! Hear you got a Boy's Club back home! Any ideas? Going to make things hum in the Senate, huh?
Uh--that's good. And--uh--you?
That's--that's splendid.
The chair recognizes the rather strong- lunged junior Senator, Mr. Smith.
One moment, friends, let's give the Senator a break.  Now, where'd you say you studied law?
Joe--drop everything and come with me!
I know that.
Who? Who? Your boss! A nut, huh? A nut! Wow! There's a *story* in this guy--! I smelled it!
What do I *mean*, huh? Uh--*I'll* tell ya--World's Series--a pass! In a month it's worth fifteen bucks!
Well, that's out. Either it's *lots* of reporters and *lots* of tickets or--. Now will you go and call 'em before I change my mind about the whole thing!
Yes. He went to Mount Vernon to give himself a patriotic address.
Nice *compliment*!
Joe, that's coming a long way in twenty years since I met you practising law down there in Main Street.
We can't drop it now, Joe. We bought the land around this Dam and we're holding it in dummy names. If we drop it or delay it--we are going to bring about investigations, and investigations will show that we own that land and are trying to sell it to the State under phoney names. No, Joe, in my judgment the only thing to do is push this Dam through--and get it over with.
That's him. Let him in.
You won't stand for it?
Oh, I see. Out steamroller methods are getting too hard to your sensitive soul, is that it, Joe? The Silver Knight is getting to big for us. My methods have been all right for the past twenty years, Joe, since I picked you out of a fly-specked hole in the wall and blew you up to look like a Senator, and now you can't stand it. Well, maybe you won't have to stand it, Joe. Maybe we can fix it so you and your Boy Ranger can go home together.
Oh, it's all right--it's all right. It seems a shame, though, to part company like this after all these years, especially now with a national convention coming up. Joe, I've put everything I have behind you. And so did all of our friends, but I guess we'll survive. We'll just have to find somebody else that's got a little more sense, that's all. In the meantime, you explain to Mr. Smith about Willet Dam. It's your bill-- it's your reputation, and if he can't find enough facts to break you with, you just send him to me and I'll give him a couple of good ones. I'm taking the next plane home.
Anything *better* to offer?
Hey--Joe! Where you going? We've got to celebrate tonight!
Well, at the expense of some of the furniture, Susan--you've made another conquest.
Senator Paine will state it!
Order!
He walks in the rain, without his hat, and talks to himself.
For no reason, I guess. He always does it. We always run into the house when we see him coming.
Why, you own it, Longfellow.
Why, you've always been pixilated, Longfellow.
Why, everybody in Mandrake Falls in pixilated - except us.
Are you married?
All right, Mr. Dodsworth. I think you'll qualify.  Take this to that desk over there for further instructions.
Were you given an assignment to follow the activities of Longfellow Deeds?
You are , aren't you?
No, thank you. I'll be all right.
Oh, that was so lovely. Thank you.
You've been having quite an exciting time here, haven't you?  All those meetings and business deals and society people - haven't you been having fun?
It's awfully nice of you to show me around like this.
I'd rather have Mandrake Falls.
Really?
I've often thought about going back.
Yeah, I know.
"Humoresque"? I'll bet you don't even know how it goes.
You know what I've been doing since I got home? Been working on a poem.  It's about you.  Sometimes it's kinda hard for me to say things - so I write 'em.
Ready?
The reason why I wanted to take a walk, Mary, is 'cause I wanted to talk to you.
Well, here we are again.
Uh-huh.
The guy's balmy.
Aw, cut it out, will you? You'll get me thinking about Charlie again.
Huh?
What'll I tell him if he calls up?
Just a minute. No, you don't.
Can I have a month's vacation?
Did it?
When're you going to see him again?
Proposed to you! You mean he asked you to marry him?
It don't look as though we're gonna get any pictures tonight.
Yes, but you said-
You try it.
I wish you luck, sir.
You can't come up here!
Must we have the echo?
He's what?
Hang up.
Yeah. A glorified doormat.
Well, your uncle was Chairman of the Board of Directors. They probably expect you to carry on.
Yes?
Where?
Mr. Deeds, are you the son of Dr. Joseph and Mary Deeds?
Are you a married man, Mr. Deeds?
Saving a lady in distress, eh? Well, I suppose we all have dreams like that when we are young.  Incidentally, we'd better get started. You'll have to pack.
I wouldn't worry if I were you. Of course, a large fortune like this entails a great responsibility - but you'll have a good deal of help. So don't worry. Leave everything to me.
No?
I think you ought to give this matter some thought, Mr. Deeds.
Why not? Who is he?
I can't hold out any longer either, Mr. Deeds.  Being an attorney for you will be a very simple affair.
Come in, please. Come in. Can I get you a cup of tea?
Sit down. Sure I couldn't get you a glass of lemonade or something?
No, I'm his housekeeper.
Oh, it'll do in a pinch.
Well, whenever I run across a funny name, I always like to poke around for a rhyme. Don't you?
I've got one for Cobb-
I've gotten the 'sackaroo' in many ways - but never in rhyme.
Well, how about tonight? What would you like in the way of entertainment?
What do you think bodyguards are for?
If they're going to poke fun at me, I'm going to-
Yes, I guess I'll have to.
She's the star reporter on The Mail. Every time you opened your kisser, you gave her another story. She's the dame who slapped that monicker on you - "Cinderella Man." You've been making love to a double dose of cyanide!
You shouldn't be running away like this. What's going to happen to the Estate?
That's impossible. The opera has never paid.
Mrs. Semple?
Yes. Have you any peculiar characteristics when you are creating?
No.
Proceed.
Now about the Falkner sisters. That's kind of funny. I mean about Mr. Cedar going all the way to Mandrake Falls to bring them here. Do you mind if I talk to them?
Proceed.
New mouthpiece. Been waiting two weeks for this. Kids keep swiping them all the time. They use 'em for bean shooters.  What can I do for you gentlemen?
Tails tonight, sir?
What do you think you're doing?
Twenty! What did he do with them?
What do you mean? I remember everything!  Hand me my pants - I wrote her phone number on a piece of paper.
You kept searching me last night, sir. Going through my pockets. You said you were looking for a rhyme for Budington.
Madame Pomponi is on the telephone, sir.
Why, that's an echo, sir!
Pack my things, Walter. I'm going home.
I said... you must come out to the house for dinner on Thursday.
I had ordered some books. "The 100 Greatest Books Ever Written."
It's my daughter Sofie... she's gotta problem.
You're the shrink, aren't you?
Thank you.
Interesting approach. What was his name?
Well... you see, when I broke it off with Phyllis, she was naturally upset and she became more determined than ever to pursue certain -- how to put it -- doubts she's been harboring...
I have eighteen more minutes!
Well, I don't know... I only been seeing you --
-- 'cause in that instant I saw the beginning of a vixen's smile and I knew --
No?
We got divorced.  I had to get rid of her. She couldn't satisfy me.
You remember when I asked you about pornography --
My guess is these images were burned into your brain when you were young. Maybe if we could nail down the exact fantasies that are haunting you -- maybe you could get past them... Anyway, I thought we could try an experiment.
Whoa, whoa, what are you doing? I want to know what's in here.
You're the doctor, what do you think?
So, is this like a Japanese restaurant?
Four months, two and a half weeks -- that's how long.  And you've already got more patients than those other two shrinks combined.
They come through a few times each year.  Hello, Mrs. Saito, good to see you again!  It's a tour.
...so rich?
Don't you at least have a back door I can use?
It's a country club. Don't worry about it.
I been drivin' since I was twelve.
Hiya, Doc.
What?
No... but it started one year to the day after my divorce became final. That's not too suspicious, is it?... But it wasn't like I was feeling bad about the divorce. Just the opposite.
You have the best answer for everything.  You seem so... hopeful. Are you always this sunny?
Is it contagious? 'Cause everyone agrees my immune system's way down.
She's not in a bad mood. She's like that all the time.  It doesn't bother me anymore. It's my dad and my brother I worry about.
Is this the treatment?
I don't know if I mentioned the headaches.
You're doing great.
You're purposely making me talk while we do this...  ...because you think this is good for me...  ...and you're a sadistic bastard...
Why'd you come to the house the other night?
Yes, something's very wrong, Dr. Mumford.
Given that, I'm obviously not going to be judging things in the most realistic way.
I'm saying that since I'm doing so much better -- which I attribute to you -- I'm liable to misinterpret some of my feelings.
I know a little about psychology. I took three different courses in college. It's true, none of them were above the two hundred level, but I took them... And there was one concept I remember very well.
Transference!
I guess you saw the show...?
...How violated I feel?
Oh.
...so he already had the tattoo that said, "Naomi Forever"... and now they're broken up, see, and he has to have it removed. But while the scar is still healing, or whatever you call it when you have a tattoo removed, he meets Chandra. And it's serious, immediate love. So in no time, he's gone from the most gorgeous model in the world to the most gorgeous actress in North America.
In maybe three or four issues.
Don't do that thing...  ...that shrink thing.
I want to have the session. I thought it would be cool if I could show you some of the things that interest me. But I guess you're not into it... which we already knew.
I don't think you know what you're talking about.
There's this kid at school... Martin Brockett. He has some gigantic idea of himself that no one else shares. You wouldn't believe the crap he lays on me... Who appointed him my spiritual leader? If he has everything so figured out how come his best friend is a .22 rifle? And why's he spend all his time chasing after me? Probably thinks I'm gonna give him a hummer...
I said I'd consider it. Nobody owns me. And the last thing was insane. I don't know what's wrong with him... No magazines.
I gotta pee.  Can I ask you something? This town is called Mumford... Been that way since... 18... 18-0... 18-0...  ...thirteen! Right?  Now here's the question -- Your name is Mumford, too.
I've got three big ones.
Lily and I talk a bit. You know Lily, runs the coffee shop?
So I guess Henry Follett is a patient of yours. He's my pharmacist.
You're a shrink, Doc. Aren't I supposed to be able to tell you everything?
All right, I'm just gonna tell you, as simple and direct as I can.  And you understand that this is a big secret? Just between us?  Okay. You know I've got this gift for certain kinds of... machines.
Sounds like kind of a good idea.
Who else knows?
Damn! What is your name?
Of course, him being insane didn't make it all right that I fell in love with his wife.
Somebody's taking a shower down there.
I know it starts with a birth certificate...
I've never brought anyone down here before.
It's all your fault. In the last 48 hours, I've completely lost interest.
I guess that makes sense.
You know where he's taking her?
We saved him! Saved him before the creature could finish his work. Now leave, all of you, quickly, before he finishes you all.
Goin' somewhere?
And you think this justifies killing innocent people!?
I wouldn't trade ya for a brass spittoon!
The sun turning black.
You bastards!
The hell with that! I'm not goin' nowhere! We're safe here.
The hell with this. I'm goin, downstairs to get me a drink. You want somethin'?
And what is he in prison for?
I will give you one hundred pounds to spare his life.
Fifty percent.
A bright good morning to all.
Do you realize, we are standing inside a room that no one has entered in over four thousand years.
No?
You were actually at Hamunaptra?
Every damn day.
Sorry, didn't mean to scare ya.
A key! That's it! That's what he was talking about.
According to my readings, our friend suffered the HOM-DAI, the worst of all ancient Egyptian curses, one reserved for only the most evil blasphemers. In all of my research, I've never read of this curse actually having been performed.
You sure you outta be playin, around with that?
According to that Book, once this creature has been reborn, his curse will spread, and as he grows in strength, so will his curse grow, infecting the people until the whole of the earth is destroyed.
It's everybody's problem!
You called me your girl?
Do you really think he'll show up?
I can't believe I allowed the two of you to get me drunk.
What do I do, Evy!? What do I do!?
Ah! Ah! Ahmenophus!
Yes, awfully tempting, wasn't it?
You're welcome to my share of the spider webs.
None taken.
Whoever's in here, sure wasn't getting out.
Damn-it! That's two down and only two to go.
Do something, Jonathan! Kill it!
You two timing psychotic bastard.
Come on, baby!
I'm her only son, and she always had such high hopes for me. Medicine. Law.
The cape. The turban. She wouldn't understand.
Hey... you okay?
Eat your mustard.
That boy's got talent.
You know I'm writing a play -- it's just a little Broadway thing, but there's a part in it that I think you'd be perfect for.
Hi.
What?
Hi.
I've never been able to figure out what to do with my life, which is why I guess I'm still a waitress.
You know what? Underneath all that anger I think there's just a little boy who wants everyone to love him.
At the Frankenstein Center.
Roy... We might never see each other again, so I'd better tell you now... I think you're wonderful.
Leave him alone. She's his mother, not yours.
What are you talking about?
Have you ever seen him?
We need a break, that's all! Nobody'd ever heard of him until he busted Casanova Frankenstein!
Why do they always fill stuff these things so full you can't pull 'em out without ripping 'em! 
So why don't you just tell her!
Nah.
I saw him go in -- and he didn't come out!
Maybe she's right.
So you're only invisible, when absolutely no one is looking at you?
So you're like... struggling superheroes?
And why are you wearing that silly costume?
Oh, Mother, I'm sorry. I know how much you wanted me to be a doctor or a lawyer with a family -- but it's just not who I am!
She likes you.
And there's the Sphinx.
And a social life.
That was too close.
Where am I going?
My dear Caulaincourt, agreements can endure only when they allow both sides to live.  Napoleon may believe it is necessary to injure England but, before that, he must realize it is necessary for him to allow his friends to live.  He cannot expect me to tell my nobles they must ruin themselves so that he can bring England to her knees -- and I'm afraid that is what it has come to.
It's a fine thing to establish policies but, when they don't work, they must be reconsidered.  Granted that you have hurt England, but she is still on her feet.  And to seal off her trade with Europe, what has it cost you?  You have had to rule with an iron hand.  You have turned friends into enemies.  And even at that, the result has only been partly effective.  You have never been able to stop the extensive cheating, smuggling and corruption -- even of your own officials.  But I should think the situation in Spain, alone, would give your policy a minus balance.  You have had to commit a quarter of a million of your best troops against the guerrillas, with no victory in sight. And you have given England a dangerous foothold on the Continent, for her armies.
I hope you will forgive me, Your Majesty, for requesting an audience at such a late hour, but I have traveled all the way from Moscow to see you, on a matter which cannot wait.
Well, has Your Majesty considered what Napoleon's alternatives might be, if you simply chose to ignore his note?
I must confess he would look a bit silly, fighting his way to Moscow and turning right around again.
What do you think Napoleon will do?
If he withdraws his army in good order, it will be a serious political defeat.  But, if he should be caught on the move, with his army, in the full grip of winter, then it will be a catastrophe.  If Your Majesty can prolong his hopes for a treaty by silence, be deceit, by any means, for another month, thus postponing his departure, then the graves of his army are already dug in the soil of Russia.
I'm glad you like it.
Yes, Captain?  Have you anything you wish to say?
Ah, my dear friend, come in, come in.  Please sit down.
I don't have to tell you of our latest difficulties.
To be perfectly honest, I haven't the vaguest idea.
Would you be prepared to handle this for me?
You realize what is at stake?
Well, Belliard, what's this?  What are you doing here?  Where is the enemy?
And where is the army?
And who is defending Paris?
But, sire, Your Majesty would lay Paris open to being sacked.  The enemy is outside the gates with more than 120,000 men.  Besides this, I left the city under the terms of a treaty and I am forbidden to reenter Paris.
I don't know what has happened to Prince Joseph.
This dispatch has just arrived from Aboukir, marked highest priority, for General Bonaparte's eyes only.
You will return to Paris tomorrow and you will carry my compliments and thanks to General Le Clerc for assigning such an excellent officer to carry out a responsibility which has meant so much to myself and to Madame Bonaparte.
I haven't been there for three years.
Ah-hh, no.
Hello there, Picart.
But to start a fire like this in five hours -- how is it possible? It would take a carefully organized plan, tons of combustibles and hundreds of people.
The Emperor has decided to marry your Archduchess, Marie-Louise.
Earlier this afternoon, the Emperor refused the hand of the Grand Duchess Anna, of Russia, and, as I'm sure you can appreciate, he is quite able to change his mind again.  For the Emperor, to choose a wife, is only a matter of minutes.
I have met her.  What is your business with me?
Will Alexander be joining us soon?
Oh...?
Thank you, Napoleon.
Good evening, sir.
No... I have a... room... at the Hotel de Perrin.
Well, it must be a good deal warmer than it is here on the street.
What's your name?
The comedy of my marriage is sufficiently well known already.
Were any of them married?
Perhaps -- but tell me you promise, anyway.
Go away -- I'm busy.
Why did you give it to him?
What the hell is the matter with you?
What was there to tell?
You mean you heard them making love?
I wanted to kill him but Joseph convinced me it would be a mistake. He said people would say you hadn't the courage to deal with it yourself.
Good day, monsieur.  Do you think it is possible for you to tell your driver to stop ringing that bell?
May I inform you, monsieur, that I am Major Fidon, official courier to the court of the Emperor Napoleon, on my way to our Embassy at St. Petersburg and, in accordance with the rules of the road, no one may overtake or pass me.
Do you like music?
Oh, no, I am very happy.  But you must have patience with me... I know nothing at all of what a wife must know.  And I know nothing about men. My papa has never allowed me even to have a pet of the male gender.
Do you know the joke about the two Swiss boys who go to a bordello for the first time?
And where do you place Alexander?
Sire, you have only enemies in the court of St. Petersburg, and I fear outside your influence, Alexander will have another look at what he has agreed to.
Citizen Lieutenant, my advice is to leave this town at once with your men.  We do not wish to do harm to our brothers in uniform.
Come in.
Come in.
His moods at this time were complex and varied.
Napoleon would soon arouse the resentment of the Directory in Paris, exceeding his authority, making political decisions and treaties like a Roman Conqueror, enlarging his role to ruler of Italy.  Only his tremendous success and ever increasing popularity prevented the Directory from replacing him.
Okay, I know what I want this time.
Just tell him to come over here and talk to me.
Well, let me in.
I know you smoke weed, right?
Me, too.  You think they're in there?
Stretch it out.
No I'm not.
Dude, dogs hate me.  I don't know why. Me and K-9's just don't get along.
Fuck, what's his name?
You know it's been over a year since we kicked it last?  Up at the family reunion.
Yep.  I forgot about him cussin' out everybody.  Damn that was fun.
This you?
Must be nice.  I wish we won the lottery. Come up on a million dollars like ya'll.
Go on and make yourself at home.  I'mma go get dressed for work.
Restraining order?  Where the hell you meet this girl?
You got a restraining order on a little girl named Baby D?
How can they do this?
It says we owe $3,900...by tomorrow.
What's the matter?
I ain't trying to get in it.
I didn't think you smoked bud that much.
Craig, what the hell are you doing?
You sure you don't wanna stay?
Most definitely.
Huh?
Easier said than done.  We saved up to get away from them, but they followed us.
I did.  Is that door locked?
Next time, page me first.
You alright?
Must be your upper lip, 'cause I don't smell nothing.
I gotta get'em fixed.  They don't roll down.
Nice neighborhood, huh?
Nigga, you got knock the fuck out.
See you later, Day-Day.  Come by after work, I got the John Blaze shit for you.
Why for?  Them boys are real player haters.
I can't get jiggy with this shit.  Where is the damn manager?
Did you see that?  That was a W.W.F. hit right there, huh, Day-Day?
I don't know.  I hope Craig got a good idea.  We gotta ask him when he comes out.  Let's go and clean up before Pinky gets here.
You wanna knock?
What?!  What that mean?
Money?  Man, we came over here from some sugar and rolling papers.  We was going to get high, and I was going to show this white boy how to make Kool-Aid.  That's all.
Finally you got a bitch, huh, Roach?
Shut up!  Both of you right now!
Why would he take it?  He don't even know you.
What you say?
If you shut up I'll tell you.  The urgent message is...Drop everything!  Craig is in trouble.  Come quick, don't call.
Just do it.
I can't feel my legs no more.
I thought you were taking me to see Mama?
Hey, what's going on?
'Take your car?'
Suga.  Go ahead and get us something to smoke on.
Huh?
Somebody close?
I need your help.
Mrs. Grant, Governor...I won't hurt you.
If I were here to hurt you I would have done it already.
What?
For what?
Could I see some identification, sir?
Daddy?
I will do no such thing.
This'11 get you in anywhere.  Red Elevator. Thirty-fifth floor.
Are you 'fucking with me!?
What would you do in my place?
He's dead?
No.
Yes, you're right, I don't understand.
The man following me has a walkie- talkie. If he sees I'm not here he'll call his partner. I do anything out of line and he'll send the word to kill my daughter.
But...
We have to hurry.
Haven't you ever seen anybody kiss like that?
Now, see, this is why you should always wear a helmet and knee pads. You never know when you're going to fall down and go boom. Right?
He has to say "over and out". Daddy, you have to say "over and out".
No. Kisses to you.
Can I get out to Flower Street from here?
Something is going to happen. When it's over you'll know what I was talking about.
Cover your mouth.
Oh, Jesus ...
Yeah, now listen.  I can't mess with these shoes any more or it's gonna look funny. You go down get yourself something to drink. Make sure Godzilla there, follows you.
Hey, would you look at this crazy car? Everybody has their own radio. What do you think of that?
This is what they call the jack. Hi, Jack!
He's going to help the police. Your daddy is going to be a hero.
You have, huh?
I'm not a baby.
Somebody mind telling me... ) What the hell happened!?
I come not with Peace but with a Sword.
You understand?
You got common sense. She ain't. When you grow up that money'll be yours. Now swear. "I will guard Pearl with my life..."
O, she's all right.
Here's your can o' hooks, Uncle Birdie.
Sure, but you was worried too, Mother; takin' off with never a word of goodbye. I even got to figurin' them gypsies busted in and done off with all three of 'em.
That boy's as stubborn and mulish as a sheep!
I must wend my way down River on the Lord's work.
I tried to save her.
Tell me a story, John.
Just a man.  Goodnight Pearl, sleep tight; and don't let the bedbugs bite.
Someone is after us, Pearl.
Now listen to me, Pearl. You and me is runnin' off tonight.
Get in the skiff, Pearl, goodness, goodness, hurry!
Kings! Why, honey, there was only one.
Why, he told me what fine little lambs you and your sister both was.
Married! We have decided to go to Sistersville tomorrow, and when we come back --
You don't reckon I'd leave you.
John's a feller who likes to keep secrets.
Now it's your turn.
You see? We can't have anything to do with John.  You and me will go down to the parlor.
Ahhh.  And is there -- a doll?
Is there anythin' -- anythin'...?
What do you figure to do?
That's mighty brave of you, Reverend.
Didn't -- didn't she leave no word?
John: take that look offen your face and act nice.
John, Mr. Powell has got something to tell you.
You thought, Willa, that the moment you walked in that door I'd start in to pawing you in the abominable way men are supposed to do on their wedding night. Ain't that right, now?
Answer me!
Somewheres down river! Parkersburg, mebbe! -- Cincinnati! -- One of them Sodoms on the Ohio River.
The Lord is merciful! What a day is this! -- And there's little John!
What do you want?
Miz Cooper!
They're just simple tests, Nan. We'll both be right here.
How long's this been going on?
Not to worry. No signs of pathology in Nancy's EEG or pulse rate. I'd guess what we've got is a normal young girl who just happens to have gone through two days of hell.
What happened? That needle sank like a rock.
It's just a stupid cat.
Why's she so bothered by a stupid nightmare, anyway?
What the hell's going on!?
Well at least I have an objective wall to bounce this off.  You believe it's possible to dream about what's going to happen?
Listen, I got a crazy favor to ask.
Jesus, it's dark in here.
Yeah. So?
They got a whole system they call 'dream skills'. So, if you have a nightmare, for instance like falling, right?
What happens if they don't do that?
What!?
Meanwhile...?
Decide to take a day off after all?
He's dangerous.
Then you know more than I do -- I haven't even been upstairs.
Please. I'm gonna go get the guy who did it and bring him to you. I just need you be right there to arrest him. Okay?
DAD! GET US OUTTA HERE!
Looks like her boyfriend did it. Rod Lane. Musician type, arrests for brawling, dope --
She lived there.
Had to've done it. No one else was in there.
Your father the cop. That's a good one.  Forget Fred Krueger. You don't want to know, believe me.
Your old man thinks I did it, don't he?
Do you think I did it?
Rod says the sweetest things.
Nice to have a fire.
What the hell you doing here?
What is it, Ninotchka?
Good evening, Anna.
And you too, Ninotchka.
You know how it is today... all you have to do is wear a pair of silk stockings and they suspect you of counter-revolution.
No, I left everything in Paris. I just happened to be wearing this.
When you get up you put on a negligee, and then you change to a morning frock.
Comrades! Comrades! Don't let's give in so quickly. After all we have to uphold the prestige of Russia.
And how is Lord Lavenham?
That's her.
Imagine, for once in our lives we were in Paris and we never went to the Eiffel Tower.
Capitalistic methods...
He's cutting our throat...
You know what they say -- there's nothing like home.
What a lovely room you have here.
I am Comrade Buljanoff.
This is the apartment we have reserved for you, Comrade Yakushova. I hope you like it.
Now let's forget everything except that we're together.
Let's not close our eyes. There are many good things to see here too.
Comrades... I'm out of the omelet.
It is high time you got out of Russia.
Guest?
Count d'Algout is still asleep.
A blue shirt, perhaps?
And Gaston, I was happier all day long. I felt I'd contributed something.
I want you to know all the White Russian exiles in Paris are keeping their fingers crossed about the jewels. They are very interested in the case. Swana suspects her countrymen.
You're looking magnificent, Leon...  ...isn't he, General Savitzky?
General, would you mind making my excuses at our table? I'll be back in a few moments.
Certainly, Your Highness, this way please... Count d'Algout made the reservation this afternoon.
Comrades, why should we lie to each other? It's wonderful.
You know, Monsieur Mercier, this is all non-sense.
We can call our ambassador.
Leon, my little boy.
We don't want to be disturbed.
Well, gentlemen... how about a little lunch?
All right, go ahead, get her on the witness stand! What can she say?
I suppose you expect us to hand over the jewels?
What's the name of that Commissar on the Board of Trade?
How much does this cost?
A week?
Come, now, you must not talk that way.... You have to adjust yourselves.... We must be brave.
Only myself and two other girls. One is a cello player in the opera and the other a street-car conductor.
This is Comrade Kopalski.
We may have a chance.
I am ashamed to put the picture of Lenin in a room like this.  Comrades, your telegram was received with great disfavor in Moscow.
We dealt directly with the representative of the Grand Duchess. I am sure if we call him he will give you a very clear picture.
That's two weeks from Thursday...
I know, gentlemen, but it is in the hands of the Court. We're helpless, aren't we?
What can I do about it?
Pardon me, I am very interested in what you just said -- you mean when an envoy goes back to Russia -- if they don't like what he has done they put him out of the way?
That's impossible! Nobody has the right.... You can't do that!... If you don't give me that visa...
Yes. Could you give me some information?
Have you never been caught in a similar situation?
Thank you.
I am interested only in the shortest distance between these two points. Must you flirt?
You are very sure of yourself, aren't you?
The foundation is one hundred and forty-one yards square...  I hope you'll forgive me but I thought you'd...
So that is your house?
Then why don't we go?  You might be an interesting subject of study.
What do we do now?
That is why I believe in the future of my country.
Your general appearance is not distasteful.
You are bringing in wrong values. Love is a romantic designation for a most ordinary biological, or shall we say chemical, process. A lot of nonsense is talked and written about it.
You don't have to do a thing. Chemically we are already quite sympathetic.
I was wounded before Warsaw.
I was a sergeant in the Third Cavalry Brigade. Would you like to see my wound?
It's midnight. One half of Paris is making love to the other half. Look at the clock. One hand has met the other hand. They kiss. Isn't that wonderful?
I have never heard one.
I don't look too foolish?
Leon, I would like to ask you something.
I wouldn't know. The closest I ever came to champagne was in a newsreel. The wife of some president was throwing it at a battleship.
Wonderful -- if one could believe it.
Oo! Darling! Something is the matter.
Oh, everything is so wonderful! It's getting farther and farther away!
Now, Ninotchka... please!
No speech.
Not white, darling.
Radio! What is radio?
Yes, sweetheart... all by ourselves.
No music.
It wouldn't be fair to the man in the street.  There they are... they are terrible things, those jewels....
Hello, Leon!
Don't you find that restful?... Why didn't you come last night?
Was it for this that I refused to endorse Dr. Bertrand's Mouthwash? I could have made a little fortune by saying that the Vincent Vacuum Cleaner was the only vacuum cleaner ever used by the Romanoffs... and now you want them to smear my life's secrets over the front page of a tabloid?
He's a waiter at the Clarence, poor devil. You know him.
You just told me you hadn't seen her.
Brutal frankness, if you insist.
Knowing the efficiency of the French Air Service I think I can guarantee that Madame Yakushova has already taken off for Moscow.
Hello, Leon darling!
That does it, Swana.  Now you mustn't miss your appointment with your hair-dresser.
I just dropped in to have a little heart-to-heart talk with you.
Now there you are completely wrong. If we sit down for a little chat, I'm sure we won't run out of conversation and what's more it won't be dull.
They always belonged to the Russian people. They were paid for with their sweat, their blood, their lives and you will give them back!
My lawyer agrees with you. He says France will uphold it in every court, but I will drag you through every court, don't forget that. And when I say it will take two years I am, as always, conservative.
You mean you have finished the whole investigation?
Well, Comrade, have you heard from your friends Kopalski, Buljanoff, and Iranoff?
I appreciate the confidence you show in me, but I must ask you to entrust someone else with this mission. I should hate to interrupt my present work. I am positive that my survey is more important than finding out whether three of our comrades have been drinking some extra glasses of champagne.
I am sorry, I don't want to overstep my position -- but please... don't send me.
This way, madame. Are you alone? By the window perhaps?  Or a nice little corner table?
I think this is the first time you have been to my little place. Your face is new to me. Now, what shall it be?
Mr. President, I don't know what to say.  As soon as we learned from the Secret Service you were en route, the Director was notified.  He should be here any minute.
The bigger problem I see is this guy who was arrested, McCord -- James McCord -- he headed up security for the Committee to Re-Elect.  He turns out to be ex-CIA.
So, what about those Watergate clowns, John?  This fuck Sirica's crazy. Thirty-five-year sentences!  There were no weapons.  Right?  No injuries. There was no success!  It's just ridiculous.
Mr. President, Hunt wants more money. Another hundred-and-thirty thousand.
He says if he doesn't get it right away, he's going to blow us out of the water.  And he means it.  Ever since his wife died in the plane crash, he's been over the edge.
We could get that.
I agree it's ridiculous but --
The President would like to know if that was the last payment.
Is it?
To protect his people.
They went after Castro.  In some crazy way it got turned on Kennedy.  I don't think the "P" knows what happened, but he's afraid to find out.  It's got him shitting peach pits.
McCord? ...
I don't have time for all this shit!  Just handle it, Bob!  Keep it out of the White House.  What else? Kissinger's waiting -- he's gonna throw a tantrum again if I don't see him, threatening to quit ... again. 
Hunt?  Howard Hunt?
Oh, I suppose you would've just let them take over.  These aren't fraternity pranks, John.  It's anarchy.  A revolution!
Excuse me ... Are you talking about recognizing China, Mr. President? That would cost us our strongest support.
The country's loving it.
This is June twentieth?
No, sir, you did not.
Who?
... an action that will at last, once and for all, show that what I knew and what I did with regard to the Watergate break-in and cover-up were just as I have described them to you from the very beginning ...
... you mentioned the "Bay of Pigs" several times.  Sooner or later they're going to want to know what that means.  They're going to want to know what was on that gap ...
They did what?!  I don't understand. Why'd they go into O'Brien's office in the first place?
Their fourth!
I did?
But what are we paying him for?
How about a COMINT classification?  We put it on the Huston plan.  Even the designation is classified.
"National security priority restricted and controlled secret."
Pat Gray'll do anything we ask him. That's why I appointed him.
Christ, you're right -- Gray makes Jerry Ford look like Mozart.  Just have Helms call him.  Helms can scare anybody.
It's got nothing to do with justice. It's national security.
I suppose you thought the Presidency was above this sort of thing.
No, no, not tonight.  Don't let her in here.  I have too much to do.
Meanwhile, what happens to the country?
The first assassination attempt was in '60, just before the election.
And not just Hunt.  Frank Sturgis, all those Cubans.  All of them in the Watergate.  They were involved in Track 2 in Cuba.  Hunt reported to my military aide. But I met with him several times as Vice President.  That's what worries the shit out of me.  I don't know how much Hunt knows.  Or the Cubans.
... he'd just found out about Track 2.
Well, one way or the other, Kent State is not good.  We have to get out in front of this thing.  The PR is going to murder us.
Congratulations, boss.  A great victory!  The madman theory wasn't so crazy after all.
So that explains his press notices. Working both sides of the fence: Jewboy Henry, always trying to get his Nobel Prize, get laid ...
Because they're not Americans.
We've got to turn the faucet off on this thing.  It's out of control ...  You might burden just me with this in the future.
... I was wondering what's such dynamite in this Bay of Pigs story?  ... although it was clearly effective, because all of a sudden it was no problem for Helms to go to the FBI and try to put a lid on Watergate.
Richard ... come with me, would you ...
It's a gift, Richard.  This law school is a gift from your brother.
President Kennedy threatened to smash the CIA into a thousand pieces.  You could do the same ...
Current levels may not be sufficient.
And of course I accept.  I'm flattered.  And I want you to know, I work for only one president at a time.
Oh, my goodness ...
Roselli?  Johnny Roselli?
We took his system out.
How the fuck did you know?
Why, you got a customer?
Mein Kampf?
Like you said Jack, I'm just a New York lawyer now.
It looks like to me we're gonna lose the war for the first goddamned time and, Dick, goddamn it, you're going along with it, buying into this Kissinger bullshit -- "detente" with the Communists.  "Detente" -- it sounds like two fags dancing.
It's your people who are leaking to the Times.  Wasn't this Ellsberg a student of yours at Harvard?  He was your idea; why are you suddenly running for cover?
Well, as you know, most of my staff have weighed in against this "incursion."  They believe it will fail to achieve anything fundamental militarily, and will result in crushing criticism domestically ...
Housecleaning?  It would be ugly, Henry, really ugly ...
... Uh, I hope this doesn't embarrass you.
What are you going to do about this Allende fellow nationalizing our businesses in Chile?  You gonna send Kissinger down there?
We can prosecute the New York Times, go for an injunction ...
This isn't '48, Dick.  They'll never buy it.
You all right?
... give me a break, Mary.
Edgar, wonderful to see you.  Clyde ... hi.
Where you from?
The Orangemen!  Now there's a football program.  Jim Brown.  And that other tailback ... The one with the blood disease ...
Hi.
That's Julie ... and that's Tricia. She, uh, reminds me a little bit of you ...
Yeah ... Guy Lombardo ...
Someone wants it ...  You can't stop it, can you?  Even if you wanted to.  Because it's not you. It's the system.  And the system won't let you stop it ...
No, no.  I'm not powerless.  Because ... because I understand the system. I believe I can control it.  Maybe not control it totally.  But ... tame it enough to make it do some good.
We gotta make 'em think we're just as tough as they are -- that Nixon's a mad bomber, he might do anything!  I played a lot of poker in World War II , and I won big, and let me tell you this -- unpredictability is our best asset.  That redneck Johnson left me with a shitty hand and I'm bluffing.  I've got to play the hawk in Vietnam and the dove in China. And if we keep our heads, we can win this thing.
Mr. President, the press guys asked if you could come back for a minute.
Shit, plenty of people did their best writing in prison.  Gandhi, Lenin ...
There's more ... there's more than just me.  You can't break, my boy, even when there's nothing left.  You can't admit, even to yourself, that it's gone, Al.  Do you think those POWs in there did?
I sure am.  The goddamned missile crisis united the whole country behind Kennedy.  And he was supporting Brown. People were scared, that's why.
I'll concede in the morning.
My God -- divorce?  What about the girls?
It would ruin us, Buddy, our family.
Were you planning to tell me?
Because ... I have to relax.
Yes!
Penny for your thoughts.
Not for the Pentagon it isn't.  I'm kissing Mao's ass.  And the press is gonna find some way to shaft Nixon on this one.
Yes.
Why didn't you?
And what would I find out that I haven't known for years.  What makes it so damn sad is that you couldn't confide in any of us. You had to make a record ... for the whole world.
It'll be over soon.
Howya doin'!  New York treating you okay?  I'm sorry I haven't been able to see you at all--
Repartee, Dick -- very good.  Hey, I feel ten years younger!  It makes a helluva difference, let me tell ya! How's the lawyer life?
You heard my -- you havin' fun with me?
I am older.
How fresh is this coffee?
...Your granddad never asked me to sign on as deputy. I done that my own self. Loretta says you're quittin'.
...What you got ain't nothin' new. This country is hard on people. Hard and crazy. Got the devil in it yet folks never seem to hold it to account.
I thought maybe she was with your boy there.
Well what would you call him.
Not word one.
I'd say it is. Not a doubt in my mind.
...You ride Winston.
Sheriff, that's aggravating.
Wasn't no bullet?
You said entrance wound in the forehead, no exit wound.
Yes Noreen you better had. Thank you.
I don't know. Any new bodies accumulated out there?
Yessir. None of the three had ID on 'em but they're tellin' me all three is Mexicans. Was Mexicans.
...Could I get you to call Loretta and tell her I've gone to Odessa? goin' to visit with Carla Jean Moss.
No.
...You got no cause to hurt me.
Big talk.
What're you doin', baby?
Not we, you. Stay with your mother.
Well thanks for fallin' all over and apologizing.
Mama's gonna raise hell.
I'm used to lots of things, I work at Wal-Mart.
You are comin back, ain't ya?
What should I do?
We don't have to do this. I'm a daytrader. I could just go home.
What's that.
And where is that.
I can't say.
Where does he work?
Mm-hm.
I think that you do. Do you know where I'm going?
You're in the hospital across the river. But that's not where I'm going. Do you know where I'm going?
What business is it of yours where I'm from, friendo?
Didn't mean nothin'.
With anything?
Well... I need to see about closin'.
Yessir.
...Don't put it in your pocket.
Don't put it in your pocket. It's your lucky quarter.
What kind of tent?
I'm waitin' to hear your description of that.
I want you to take me to another motel.
Yessir.
Could I get another room.
Then you'll like me.
...What do you do?
So was I.
Look. You need to give me the money. I've got no other reason to protect you.
Don't jack with me.
Nam?
Sorry you had to see that. You were saying?
IF THIS IS ABOUT DEL, FORGET IT! I'M NOT COMING BACK!
I thought you said the eggs weren't...
You should get the order you want.
Ahh, what'd you do now... fall off your bike again?
Bad idea...
Oh, you're sharp as a tack, Elden.
You're lying!
What the hell do you want?... Hey, Sue Ann, what's up?
Come on, Elden, think about it. The driver, all them trunks standing open like that... something's going on here!
Well, do something, then, damnit!
That's a lie! I figured it out! I've been trying to tell this dumbass --
We need ammo... Go check his jacket, I'll cover you.
So you weren't involved with him in his pathetic attempt to diversify?  Were you mixed up in the drugs, Betty?
I'm appreciably older than you, but my health is good. I take care of myself, and I got some money socked away. You'd never have to work again, that's for sure. I'd treat you like a queen.
So all this... really was because of that soap opera? My son is dead because you came out here to be with that doctor? A fake doctor?
Wesley didn't even want to come up here. He warned me, but I insisted...  I have to ask you, Betty...are you crazy?
What you did yesterday was reckless at best. You are not an employee of this hospital! If that boy dies I don't even want to think of the lawsuit that'll follow. Are we communicating here?
Did you watch it yet?
No... what about your sister?
All you been through... I ever tell you what a good friend you are?
Something bad happened to Del and me, didn't it?
Halfway where? You've gotta come home. We've been worried sick about you. Are you alright?
I gotta go.
...of course you do.  You don't remember me?
I beg your pardon?
Honey, I didn't want to tell you at the time, but Del and I go way back. We went to school together. In fact, he saved my life. Two more minutes in that icy water and I would have drowned. But Del jumped in and grabbed me. We fell out of touch eventually, but I still owe him one.
I tried to tell myself it was for the best, that there was a reason behind it. But... Del?
You never gave us a chance...
Lyla's very nice.
She told me I was charming and relentless, and would go far in this town. And she said that unlike the other charming, relentless people she knew, she liked me.
Carleton School of Nursing. Two semesters, but Del made me give it up...
I haven't been this happy since I was twelve years old.
Yeah, I felt that way, too, when I first started, but now... the hours, the repetition... it's not all glamour and mall openings anymore. Maybe I should've listened to my people and tried to make the crossover to nights earlier, I don't know...  ...I just hope it's not too late for me. God! Listen to me, "Me, me, me." It's so easy to get caught up in the whole ego cycle of this business and make it all about yourself. Stop, right? That's it, no more about me tonight, I promise... Let's talk about you... what do you think about me? I'm kidding... Seriously, Betty, I'm doing all the talking here...
You know, I almost believe that... you're like a warm breeze that's suddenly blown into my life...  I said that to Leslie, once, at her funeral, remember?...
David, I don't... Can we talk privately for a second?
Why are you doing this to me?
George...
I don't need one, but it's kind of a special night, and --
And I don't need Sue Ann's fat ass around to fuck it up...
It's people with no lives watching other people's fake lives.
Well, are you gonna answer me? What'd you come here for?
You're not on that soap opera thing again, are you? 'Cause you know what that is?
Uh-huh.
Yes.
Betty! Boy, am I glad to see you!
So you're into "Reason," too? Finally, someone civilized! I'm Ellen, what can I get you?
If that little weasel ever walked in here I wouldn't serve him.
And you called your friend, and she's telling you not to go?  When I went to Europe my friends told me I was crazy.
How did you know?
Dr. David Ravell.
Piss off, Merle.  So how you gonna find him, Betty?
I can't believe I remembered that, although I suppose I should. I wrote it...  But that was seven years ago, and you're quoting it verbatim. I'm flattered... I think. Or frightened. What's your name?
She called you 'George,' George.
ARE YOU CRAZY?!! STOP IT!!!
So why'd you come to L.A.?
It's something I had to do. For David.
No... I don't really know where he is yet. I'm at a hotel around the corner.
Hmmm. Sounds like you've had a pretty tough go of it with men...
The Five?
Okay... oh, umm, would you mind if I borrowed some clothes?
You know, the more I think about it, this really isn't David's kind of place.
Had. She died in a car accident last year. She was decapitated.
Don't worry, I'm looking... just taking a tiny break.
So what do you say? Can we be friends?
This isn't fair, you know. Do you always get what you want?
You should have a little faith in people.
What are you doing?
What? No, I'm not gonna let you just run out of here... You need to talk about what's going on...
Your husband?!
Yeah, but your running away isn't going to help you with all this...
Blake, I can handle that transplant!
More than you know. Is there anything else?
The fuck you talking about?
I like this. I like doing business in the home. It's cozy...  Who's birthday?
We appreciate that. But you just poured me a drink, I'd like to enjoy your hospitality for a few minutes.
I didn't think so. So, give me an example of a stupid person doing a stupid thing. Not being stupid, you're equipped to recognize it.
Let's see... around here that would be Kiowa, Kickapoo or Osage, if I'm not mistaken.
Bourbon, little water, thank you.
Hey... you got a fine one right here!
No, that's ignorant. They just don't know any better.
That's right.
I didn't. You gave me a look!
It's not here. Let's go.
Let me tell you something. In our business you can't put food on the table if your phone doesn't ring. The guys who get the calls are good -- not flashy, just good. They get in, they get out. Nobody knows a goddamn thing. Understand? Boom, boom, boom. Three in the head and you know they're dead.
I hope you're right...
Joyce was screwing Del.
I'd say that about torches her credibility, wouldn't you?
No, I see Betty as a Midwestern Stoic type. Ice water in her veins. A clear thinker. Probably a Swede or a Finn.
Oh, for Chrissakes. It just means the kind of person who can eat shit for a long time without complaining, then cut their momma's throat and go dancing the same night.
Okay, thank you, goodbye... Keep in touch...
We should go.
Every American should see the Grand Canyon. Are you an American?
So you believed the bartender. Why?
Wesley...
You were right. Del wasn't lying.
We could do that. I could be on my way to Florida, and you could go to Thailand and fuck your brains out.
I don't like talking bad about the dead, but now that he's gone I can tell you she put up with things in that marriage I wouldn't have. And yes, she, of all people, was the one who defended him. And that's why what that sheriff said makes me so angry.
She makes me stretch! I got inside my character last night like I haven't done in six years on "Reason". It was a totally rejuvenating experience.
Let me try this, goddamnit! SHE'S BEEN DOING IT ALL WEEK, SHE CAN DO IT NOW!
This story is beyond belief, which is perfect for us. It's free advertising and it's gonna run for months.
And she always had such spirit! But, after her mother died...
Because it ain't natural, young man.
No, about... Are you talking about Duane Cooley?
So how's it going with your new roomie? What's her name?
Maybe we're suing him for malpractice. What's his name again?
Did Chloe crack?
You lie, motherfucker...
Her show?
Huh?
Thankee boys for throwin' in that fricasee. I'm a man a large appetite and even with lunch under my belt I was feeling a mite peckish.
'N I'm Delmar O'Donnell.
You got light fingers, Everett. Gopher?
Why don't we bed down out here tonight?
Preacher said my sins are warshed away, including that Piggly Wiggly I knocked over in Yazoo!
But there were witnesses, saw us redeemed!
This ain't no laughin' matter, Everett.
Now wuddya suppose is eatin' George?
Uh, we uh-
Pete have a brother?
Well that's right! If then! Believe me, Delmar, Woman is the most fiendish instrument of torture ever devised to bedevil the days a man!
We'll go fetch it with ya, Everett.
What's his name again?
You don't know where his goddamn folks from; you speakin' outcha asshole.
Gonna pluck us off the tit.
Ass right.
Pullin' ah pants down...
Helluva idea.
No one says no to Pappy O'Daniel.
Vernon Waldrip.
Pappy O'Daniel be laughing' then.
No - you stop it! Vernon here's got a job. Vernon's got prospects. He's bona fide! What're you?
I can and I am and I will - tomorrow! I gotta think about the little Wharvey gals! They look to me for answers! Vernon can s'port 'em and buy 'em lessons on the clarinet! The only good thing you ever did for the gals was get his by that train!
McGill. No, the marriage'll take place as planned.
...Time for this old boy to enjoy some repose.
That's one of Aunt Hurlene's.
A 9,000-hectacre lake, honey.
Huh?! They dam that river on the 21st.  Today's the 17th!
Well, I'll be a sonofabitch. Delmar's been saved!
Pete... I do apologize.
We prayed to God and he pitied us!
That ain't the tune you were singin' back there at the gallows!
Hold on there - I don't want this pomade, I want Dapper Dan.
No! I don't want Fop! Goddamnit - I use Dapper Dan!
...Yeah?
Hey, honey, look at this! My son! Isn't he beautiful?  You should've called!
So what're you doing in Seattle?
Hey, what did you want? A lot of fatherly bullshit? A big pat on the back?
I knew you'd make it!  Where's your girl? Didn't she come?
Good morning, girls.
Hey, did you hear? Sands and Kantrowitz DORed last night.  Survival of the fittest.
Esther, do you think she's using...  ...birth control?
He doesn't mean anything by it, Zack. Do you, Joe?
Are you laughing at me, dick-brain?
You didn't kick him out...? Wait, didn't he tell you what he's been going through?
You're good.
I know.
Hi, son.
What did you call me, boy?
Before that.
You said, 'How're you?' I am not a 'ewe,' boy! A ewe is a female sheep, boy! Is that what you think I am, boy?
Lauder, Sweet Pea!
Only two things come out of Oklahoma, steers and queers. Which one are you, boy? I don't see any horns so you must be a queer.
Daddy, I don't want to get into anything with you tonight. I'm tired and I...
Yes I do!
If you won't take me to dinner with your parents, I won't meet you at the motel.
How late?
Forget that. Come on. Got a little surprise...
I'm not pregnant. I got my period this morning. There's no baby, Sid.
Come on, guys. It's five o'clock.
Far fucking out! I've been wanting to meet one of the Blue Angels since I can remember.
You know what I mean. Would you... let yourself get pregnant?
No more backward, if you ask me, than the way these hotshot assholes fuck us, then ditch us.  Don't you ever feel used, Paula? Don't you ever feel like if this is all you get for your trouble then the sonofabitch ought to be paying for it...?
Lynette, where's Sid?
What did you tell him about the baby?
Italian. My mom was Irish. I got her ears. But the rest is all wop.
Everywhere and nowhere, Paula the Polack.
My father is a Rear Admiral in the Seventh Fleet.
Yeah. We've lived all over the world. Katmandu, Moscow, Nairobi.
Do you go to school?
I don't know who you think you're talking to! I ain't some whore you brought here! I've been trying to be your friend and you treat me like shit!
You know, sometimes I wish I was one of those girls they're letting in the flight program these days. God, I'd love to fly.
I've seen all that a hundred times.
Hey, what about Sunday dinner? When're you gonna let me know?
So, after you graduate you go on to basic flight, right? Is that in Pensacola?
Because my real father wouldn't marry her.
Paula, he DORed and nobody's seen him.
How do you figure that's your bunk?
I see you didn't DOR, Mayo.
That Foley looks like he's been through a war or two.
Jets.
You okay?
I kid you not, Mayo, I am in love. We must've set a new indoor record today. You want to know how many times we did it?
I don't believe that. They're just having a good time, same as us.
You should've done what I did. A clean break.
So what's the problem? Girls do that all the time.
Not if she won't even talk about an abortion.
Okay, but what if it's like Foley said and she got knocked up, to trap you -- is it still your responsibility?
He's right, Zack. It doesn't matter.
Please, Zack -- go back to the barracks!
What the fuck is funny about this?
Yes.
You can.  You're full of ideas.  You just need to squeeze one out.
One.  Squeeze.
Th --
You got an idea?
YOU KNOW HOW THIS IS GONNA GO!
They're not supposed to be here!
What tables?  I've never seen him before.
It's still a good plan.  It's just... got a twist.
I'm afraid to let you think, Junior. Things get worse when you think.  Oh, that's gonna help.
We're not leaving.  I'm getting in that room, and I'm opening that safe.
I mean it!
What do you want?
I don't have to tell you there is an acute shortage of living space in Manhattan right now and this is a highly unique property.
I hardly see how family gossip is germane to showing the property.
Could the child please stop that?
Oh, I've seen these...
Hey, this is perfect for you...  Absolutely!  You're a woman, you're living alone now.  Your alarm goes off, or you head glass break, or for whatever reason you think someone's broken into your home in the middle of the night.  What are you going to do?  Call the police and wait until they get here on Tuesday?  Traipse downstairs in your sexy little underthings and check it out?  I think not!
Wait a minute, wait a minute.  We can still handle this.  Can we still handle this?
-- seventeen feet wide, fifty-five feet deep, forty-two hundred square feet, four floors with a rentable basement apartment, so five altogether, courtyard in back --
No, Edgar Allen.
Can't hear a thing.
"What we want is in that room."
Fuck.
Are you freaking out?
Why did the chicken cross the road?
Why did the chicken cross the road?
YOU CAN'T DO THAT!  YOU CAN'T FREAK OUT LIKE THAT!  YOU HAVE TO STAY HERE WITH ME!
What, what, what is it?!
What would you think, in the middle of the night?  I mean, three what, three bears?  He'll call the police.
Okay, listen, honey, you went double digit here, you must have been shooting out adrenaline like crazy, we gotta bring your blood sugar back up, okay?  Can you hear me?
Hey, she's still a smart ass, excellent sign.  Did you see any sugar in here?  Any candy bars, anything sweet?
Tyrone...
Alma I told you to...
Lemme see that rifle son...
This brothers is gonna be a colossal event. We'll shut the mother down right at the capitol, in front of the cameras.  Will you cool it? What's up man? What it be Bobby?
You got six months to donate to the party, Bobby?
I expect to hear from you soon. If Huey Newton takes a crap, I want to know how big it was. Otherwise I'm gonna come looking for you. And I won't be as "friendly" as today.
Judge, hold on, is your phone safe?
Hey... what the hell you doing?
Yeah... I'm fucked up. You're fucked up. Government's fucked up. Whole country's fucked up. You got no idea what's going on here. This is bigger than you and me. We're just little tiny soldiers getting moved around on some big asshole's desk. The Panthers... fuck you're history... they killed you and you don't even know it.
God damn... Kid never had a chance...
Aaaah, Bitter Motherfucker... I almost forgot how nasty that shit is.
Motherfucker... you stay away...
C'mon Judge we got to start somewhere.
...Glad you came man.
Man, did you see Huey down on Grove street? All up on that cop, that was beautiful.
You got it. Berkeley?
You want me to put a man on it?
One: "We want freedom. We want the power to determine the destiny of our Black Community." Two: "We want full employment for our people." Three: "We want to end the robbery by the white man of our Black Community." Christ, they're asking for reparations...
Yes sir, I did.
Huh, well then...  did someone else start shooting?
Shit, nothing but Paper Panthers.
We'll get them. Right now we got to worry about being armed and ready to protect Betty Shabazz. Those phonies sure as hell can't. We need guns.
Huey man I got to talk with you...
Alone...
That's right. We'd be proud to provide as escort for Malcolm's widow. How many men you got?
We put our lives on the line today. Malcolm X's widow was on the line today. And your guns weren't even loaded.
Judge... we're doing security for Betty Shabazz's visit next week. I'd like to have someone who knows there way around a pistol there. Someone like you.
Okay man I ain't going to push. But remember the revolution isn't going to wait for anyone. Come on, we'll give you a lift.
Hey, GI bill pays for school. And shit, if I stuck around here, instead of signing up, I'd probably be in jail, or sitting on the stoop drinking Bitter Dog with Rose, you know?
What it be Judge. Nobody got hurt, Sister Betty's safe. This was a good day...
You were alright Judge, better than alright. You're what the Party needs. A fighter but also one that's going to school not making the man too nervous.
Aw... uh... it's was just harassment. My driver's license expired.
What's the pig's name?
And you're gonna do just that. But I'll tell you what to feed the pig. You alright with this?
I saw... but...
Yeah, I do.
You're a smart brother... you should dig what Huey and Bobby got to say...
Huh?
The pigs are gonna start flooding us with dope. Huey wants us to stop them.
Motherfuckers...
We'll all get out of here together.
My Mom's at that.
Unh... Unh Man... I don't take no money from friends that need help. Fuck no. What do you think I am a bum?
Ain't no one seen him.
Yeah.
You believe that?
I know who you are, Gabriel Marion. The last time I saw you, I was nine and you put ink in my tea.
He reminds me of you before you got old and ugly.
They're from good stock on their mother's side.
How did this... how did I let this happen?
You're surrendering.
Shall we proceed?
I beg to differ.  One is a command decision on your part.  The other represents nothing more than the occasional over-exuberance of field officers attempting to carry out their duty in difficult circumstances.
Very well, let us move on to...
How can we end this madness?
The New York and Rhode Island assemblies have been dissolved...
Rioting both sides of the bay, in Chestertown they burned the Customs House and tar-and-feathered the Customs Agent.  He died of burns. In Wilmington they killed a Royal Magistrate and two Redcoats.
We'd cover more ground if we split up.
Did your father teach you humility?
And, Corporal...  ... be careful.
Sir, I'd like to request a furlough. Two days?
Don't go in there.
Father, tell me what happened at Fort Wilderness?
That's why it was four years between you and Thomas.  It took me that long to regain her respect.
We buried them, then we went to track.  It was a cold trail and they were moving fast.  We went faster. We caught up to them at Kentucky Ford.
There are some letters here from him.  Some are just to you.
You don't hate him.
Mister Robinson, I fought with Captain Marion in the French and Indian War, including the Wilderness Campaign.  We served as scouts under Washington and I have no doubts about Captain Marion's courage or competence on a battlefield. There's not a man in this room, or anywhere, for that matter, to whom I would more willingly trust my life.
And your principles?
I recognize him now.  Is he as imprudent as his father was at his age?
Green Dragoons came to my home, killed my son, Thomas.  It was Tarleton himself.
Lord Cornwallis will be with you presently.
How far away?
Margaret, take William and Susan to the river shed.  Hide there.  If we're not back by dawn, go up the river to the Richardson's house. They'll take you to your Aunt Charlotte's farm.  Nathan, Samuel, and I are going to get Gabriel.
Colonel, let us help his soul find it's place with the Almighty and...
Put those away.
Father?
But where are we going, Mr. Crandall?
Have you got a death-wish, Ellen?
Good God! Where'd you hear that?
Because you promised.
I don't get it.
I can hardly read these.
Well, there's a dead cat over here on the edge of my lawn, Louis. I think it might be your daughter's.
It's Church.
No, you shouldn't have stopped. But you got away with it. Important thing is are you sure you're all right?
I tried to tell myself I buried him alive. You know--Edgar Allan Poe meets Felix the Cat. But...
Can I have another one?
They buried their dead and for a long time their dead stayed buried. Then something happened. Half the tribe died in a season. The rest moved on. They said a Wendigo had soured the ground.
Out of the mouths of babes, Louis.
Please, I want to wake up. Leave me alone. It's not my fault you died; you were as good as dead when they brought you in--
I'll tell you where the ground is sour--the ground in my heart is sour. Let me tell you something else, Vic-baby: Wrong is wrong.
---and you'll end up doing a free consultation on his arthritis or urinary problems and---
That's enough of that kind of talk!
Not by me, it isn't. I know how badly I acted, how unfair I was. It's just that I..you know.
I'm going to try to do better.
My dory.  The Jolly Mon.  Where is it?
You've got one shot -- and we can't die.
You're setting me up for a double cross, you with the ship, and me with nothing more than your word!
Jack, I don't trust you, and that's a fact.  Never trust a smiling man, you can lay to that.
It's pure evil to make a Captain walk the plank of his own ship, twice in one lifetime.  No good can come of it.
No, I really think I do.
The situation has changed.
Just so you know, Jack -- I don't think you're that clever.  I think you're a fool.  A mortal fool.
Now?
My apologies, miss.  As you were saying, before you were so rudely interrupted?
There was a lot of long words in there, miss, and we're not but humble pirates.  What is it you want?
I am disinclined to acquiesce to your request.  Means 'No.'
You've got sand, for a maid.
And how does a maid come to own a trinket such as that?  A family heirloom, perhaps?
No, no, nothing like that.  Very well.  You hand that over, we'll put your town to our rudder and ne'er return.
I think it would be rather exciting to meet a pirate.
Commodore, I must protest.  Pirate or not, this man saved my life.
It's -- beautiful. May I inquire as to the occasion?
There.  And don't you dare tell me that wasn't a proper kiss!
What's in your head to put you in such a fine mood?
Blast it, I'm already awake!
I'll tell lee.  Now, Jack Sparrow has an honest streak in him, and that's where the whole problem starts.  This was when he was Captain of the Black Pearl --
Raise the sails.
Hands!  Come about!  Jackets off the cannons!  We are to fire on our own ship?
Well, well... Jack Sparrow, isn't it?
Taking stock: you've got a pistol with only one shot, a compass that doesn't point north ... and no ship.  You are without a doubt the worst pirate I have ever heard of.
That chart I drew up'll get you past the reefs.  If you're steersman's good enough, that is.
Who makes all these?
The ship's real enough.  So its anchorage must be a real place. Where is it?
Because you're a pirate.
I can get you out of here.
I'd die for her.
Come aboard.
It's still against the law.
Everybody stay calm.  We're taking over the ship!
I swear, you look just like him.
What's that?
You haven't seen it.
No.
Captain Norrington... I appreciate your fervor, but I am concerned about the effect this subject will have on my daughter.
Look, I don't mean to rain on everyone's ascension here, but we got a little problem.
Not anymore, Mr. O'Brien.  The nanobot has changed that.
You can't mean that.
I swear to you, Argon, if you don't stop the meltdown that nanobot will be the last one I ever build.
I know what you're doing.
But, Poppy, you don't know what this means --
Oh no.  No.  We'll get her assistant.  What's-his-name? Nebbishman?
And you still believe he's going to come here?
Do you think she loves him?
Poppy, are you in one of your moods again?
Look at me, Icarus!  Look at my body.  I've done everything, changed anything you asked me to.  'We will always love most that which we create.'  Is that still true?
Then you still love me?
It will be an ascension.
Did you feel that?
Okay.  Alright.  Okey-dokey.  Now, we need the nanobot.  The nanobot that initiated the reaction.  Once we have that we can stabilize the meltdown.  Simple really.  No problem.
Facts, Dr. Nebbleman.  Facts. You've been using cryogenics to control the waste from the mouse experiment, haven't you?
Dr. Makeo is working on it now, sir. I estimate at least another six hours.
Yeah?  So what?
Of course, sir.
Argon is a lunatic!  I can't believe I was stupid enough to believe I could control him.  You heard what he said, Nigel.  He doesn't care if all of Calumet City is turned to Jell-O.  How can that not affect you?
Is that what Argon told you?
Yes?
Oh yeah.  See, Susie, a man doesn't do the hard time and just pick up where he left off.  Oh no.  The big house does things to a man.
Do you ever wonder what happened to us, Susie?
Yeah.
They did it to me!
... just like the mouse.
Oh God, please!  This can't be happening!  I can't be plastic!  A plastic man?!
You're not protecting the world, you're obstructing progress!
I want you to know that I really appreciate you helping me.
What's wrong?
How far can you stretch?
I'm going to go out for a while.  I want to take the blood samples to a lab that has the equipment I need.
I could go with you.
Susie... I...
All the different ways that I could kill you.
Maybe you're ready to find out if that hide of yours is bulletproof?
I spoke to Dr. Argon this morning and he remains frustrated over the loss of the original nanobot.
I could have you fired right now.
It might be paranoia, but I've never lost my keycard before.
If this nutcase did take it and has half a brain, he'd use it right away, before we could invalidate it.
Miss Wilson will give you the guest list and any other details you may need, Miss Gallagher.
What do you want?
Where did you get those letters?
Will - uh - five thousand be enough?
I'm just beginning to believe that something could be done with you.
Oh, yes you will my dear - oh, yes you will my dear - you'll wear garters and you'll like it too!
You know, Stewart, you failed to mention that Miss Gallagher was a very beautiful young girl.
Is this true, Stewart? Did you really say it?
It's a good thing your father passed away before he saw insanity ravage the family. I can't imagine what made you do such a thing. A reporter! Of all things, a reporter! A barbarian who lets his socks come down!
Why doesn't Dexter show some decency? And you might show some too, Mother. What do you expect a man to do when he's called such names?  I'm glad you hit that reporter, Stewart. He deserved it.
What's the matter? Isn't there a 'bless you' in the crowd?
This way.
I knew your managing editor very well.
So, you see how silly that rumor is?
Thank you very much.
Say, take it easy! Take it easy! Listen, my boy. No use you hanging around here. Just buy the Tribune tonight and read all about it. You can rewrite it for your last edition.
Impossible. Put it on again.
Would you like to have me turn around for you, Bingy?
How's that?
Is there a green elephant standing beside that bwana?
Big Chief Bingy come to white man's tepee to make friends. Big Chief very sorry. To show how sorry - will bend over and let white man kick Big Chief where sun never shines.
Well, Stew, that's all thrashed out. By golly, I'm surely glad to see that you're not really sore. You know our racket - after all, news is news.
Yeah.
Yeah, little Gloria.
Why not?
And live on your salary, I suppose?
Araby?
How do you like your bath, sir?
Who are you?
Yes. I must have been pretty much plastered if I hired a valet.
What are you doing fooling around in here?
Say, you are nice. You're all right. You'd make a good wife.
Are you trying to tell me that I need someone to help me put on my pants and button them up?
Yes.
Why, a list of the guests. That's the usual thing, isn't it?
Mr. Smith? Oh, you mean Ann Schuyler's husband?
The boss is getting hoarse.
There you go, talking like a woman!
Well, well, well! Gallagher, old pal! There you are. What did you run away for?
Remember, she's a Schuyler.
My error.
Oh, I'll call you up some time. And if your social duties permit - why -
Sure - I think so, Stew.
How is her family going to feel about it?
There you are-!
Well, I'll have to look someplace else.
They all consider me just as one of the boys.
Okay.
You know what I should do with you? I should sock you right in that funny little nose.
Isn't he the one that always writes about things - only the things he knows about?
Then why don't you write about something you know?  Write about yourself and Anne. The poor boy who marries a rich girl - now there's a swell theme.
Hey, Gallagher!
But that's ridiculous! You can't make a sudden change like that.
A statement? Good.
Well, at best you might deny it.
Indeed? Perhaps he will do me a great favor.
Stop calling me Mother!
Good morning, everybody-  Well, maybe it isn't a good morning, huh?  Anne, did you ever get the feeling that there was someone else in the room with you?
What's going on here? Who is this woman?
Found no skeletons?
Smythe, what do you do with yourself - I mean, when you're not carrying those double-strength - what do you do with yourself?
Hmmm, you just putter. Do you have to have a putter to putter?
Yes sir.
I just love you in that sweater Mary-Sue. It's so flattering.
I put blueberries in them just the way you like.
Bud. Mary Sue ... Breakfast is on the table.
There's a meatloaf sandwich in there too. Don't go skipping dinner just 'cause you're not here anymore.
I just thought ... It's beautiful.
Where'd you get this?
No she's not.
Wait ...
What is that?
You can't go out there.
Look. Let's just forget about it. Let's just go to the meeting and ...
I made a couple of lunches for you and put them in brown paper bags ...  I'm gonna go now.
I sure am glad you said you'd come out with me tonight Mary Sue.
Anyhow ... I really wanted to come over and sit next to you in civics but ...
... Why?
I'm busy.
I don't believe it.
C'mon. Everyone's turning colors. Kids are making out in the street. No one's getting their dinner-- hell, you could have a flood any minute ... Pretty soon you could have the women going off to work while the men stayed home and cooked ...
Why don't you start by saying "yes," and then getting me one of those swell pineapple kabobs.
BUD--WHY DID YOU DO THIS?
I think I've got something to say.
What do you mean!?
How'd you know about the fire?
What did you do?
Okay, now you listen to me! I don't know what's going on but you'd better fix it! I had a date with Mark Davis and I even bought new UNDERWEAR!
No! I'm not gonna do it! If I don't dress like this for Mom I'm sure as hell not going to do it for you!
Why can't we just EXPLAIN IT?
I could like kill a guy with these things.
He-llo? I've got like three pounds of underwire here ...
Me too. Sounds swell.
Seemed kinda sexy. Look. I read 35 pages.
Yeah ...
Gone out with you. She woulda like rearranged your tonsils.
Besides. You think there's like a chance I'm gonna get into college back there?
No. I baked them for you.
Hi.
Sure ... Where would we go?
Mmmmgh.
Yeah ... I guess.  I don't know.
So what's it like?
What's that like?
You want some berries?
What do we do?
Can I open it?
I like calling you David.
You're unbelievable. You'll win this thing for sure. When is it on?
... Like Prince Charming.
Yeah ...
Why would I do that?
So even though I can't make any promises, well--I figured if you asked me real nice--I might just be willing to talk about it again.
Look--it just sort of "happened" ...
Look ...
OKAY. NOW YOU'RE REALLY STARTING TO PISS ME OFF!
Where's the remote control I gave you?
Have you cooked the burgers?
Look. I thought we talked about this, I thought we said ...
You know what I really like?
Wow ... That's pretty good ...
What's wrong?
TV repair.
You think you could do this like soon? It's almost six thirty.
Dream come true, hunh?
Oh GOD ...
Saw you at the mall yesterday.
I'm just working....I have some customers here.....
Well, I can't talk though --
Yes, I'll be there.
Did you think that we'd all be looking at you?
Hey, how are you? BARRY I'm fine, hi, how are you?
Yes, indeed, yes I am.
Well I don't want to do something like that.
Yes but I get tense and I feel like I can't be myself if that happens.
...please, I just don't want it....
I know.
It's not cool?
I'll leave then, I'll go to get something from my car, go away so you don't feel pressure. Can I ask you a serious question:
Why's it here?
Oh My God, yeah, I know exactly where she is, why?
Tell me why.
No.
I'm horny, Jack, what about you?
Hello?
I'm fine. Who is this?
Yeah. No. It's ok. What's goin' on?
I know but I....how much is it?
Yes, no, yes. I can't. I can't afford that. I'm sorry. Sorry.
No. No. We got disconnect -- why?.....you're calling me at work....how did you get this number -- ?
You lied to me?
Hello?
Hi. Do you work at the mechanic?
Is it ok if I leave my car you think?
There's a piano in the street.
Maybe I'll see you later, when I pick up my car?
Do you remember me, I left my car, yesterday.
It was great to meet you again. To see you again, thanks for helping me yesterday --
That's very nice. Thank you. Thank you for saying that.  You're friends with my sister?
How long have you known her?
You like her?
-- the promotion says: buy any 10 Healthy Choice products and get 500 miles of airline travel or 1,000 for purchases made with a special coupon. So in the supermarket, you notice their products, first you notice they have a Teriyaki Chicken Dinner at $1.79 - that's a pretty good deal....but then I noticed they had soup at 89 cents a can.....and you start to do the math and you start to notice that it's a really amazing deal because I stumbled across the pudding at 25 cents a cup. Now the crucial thing is the bar codes on the label. That's those little bar codes, you know? The universal product codes?
....No....
My friend Carlos is doing it who works with me. It's his. It's his pudding, he's doing it. It's not mine. He's crazy. I told him not to do it. He's the one who's insane. He only spent about one hundred dollars so far though --
Ok....well...I'm gonna go.
It was nice to see you again, to see your face again, to go out with you --
This is Barry.
Really?
Yeah?
I just...your face is so adorable and your cheek and your skin, I wanna bite it....I wanna bite your cheek and chew on it....god damn cute....fuck....
Yeah.
Lena I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry that I left you at the hospital..... I called a phone sex line. I called a phone sex line before I met you and then these four blond brothers came after me and you got hurt and I'm sorry -- and I had to leave because I don't want you to get hurt again and now I'm here and I'm back and I have a lot of pudding that I can redeem in six to eight weeks and if you give me that much time I can get enough miles to fly with you wherever you have to go if you have to travel for your job because I don't want to be anywhere without you.....can you please let me redeem the mileage?
Why?
No.
Your hand is bleeding.
Sir, I have no way of proving that you demolished the bathroom --
I'm gonna call the police then, sir.
What do you mean?
And your Social Security number.
It's just for verification through the credit card company.
I'll say whatever I want --
Can we agree that that is that?
How many sisters do you have?
How's business?
What's up?
Hey, good morning, Barry.
You ok?
Why you wearin' a suit?
That's part of a very interesting airline promotion giveaway that's really tremendous. I'm going to start a collection of pudding and coupons that can be redeemed for frequent flyer miles through Healthy Choice and American Airlines --
Which guy in Toledo are you talking about?
Ok. Well. I'm gonna go out of town. I'm going to go out of town just for two days...
I'm going to go to Hawaii but you can't tell my sisters that.
Alright: And I have to go and buy some more pudding for this trip to Hawaii and as I just said that out loud I'm realizing it sounds a little strange but it's not. So can you come and help me out?
You know you can get places in the world with pudding. That's funny.
Whoa...whoa...wait, wait -- don't please....
Ok.
I don't really remember that.
This is this place called Ace Vintage, you gotta find it, I don't know exactly where this is and I don't understand these maps so just go there and check it out. It's a '61 AC Cobra that this old guy says is fine, but I need to figure out why he's only asking 23 for it. So take a look, the whole thing, call me about that, if it seems alright then I'll head down there and check it out.
He's wearing a suit again, I don't know why he's wearing a suit, he doesn't usually dress like that --
I'll go pay for my car.
So I'll meet you at the restaraunt?
You've been to his quarters, haven't you?
I hear he's got a whetstone and chisel, and he uses them to sharpen his teeth.
Marquis? Is that you?
"One day, Fanchon's first client was a surgeon. He ran his fingers across her naked skin, pulling apart folds of flesh, inspecting each and every follicle..."
Has he hurt you?
But why must you indulge in his pornography?
It's a sin against God for me to refuse your kindness. But my heart's held fast here...
Madeleine, I... there are certain things... feelings... we must not voice.
Free his mouth.
I should've told you it was the blood of Christ; you'd believe that, wouldn't you?
It's true, dear-heart, you've spoiled me pink.
I'm entertaining you now, aren't I?
But you implored me to write! For curative purposes, to stave off my madness --
It's a fiction, not a moral treatise.
I thought that was your duty, Abbe, not mine.
Fuck 'em! They're half-wits and pinheads. Let 'em die on the streets, as Nature intended.
Perhaps -- in time -- you'll earn them back through good behavior --
Start with the Bible; it's cheerier, and more artfully written.
Madeleine. She's besotted with me; she'd do anything I ask. She could pay you a midnight visit --
"Part the gates of heaven," as it were --
My bed, gone! Am I to freeze to death?
-- water! --
What in God's name am I to do with you? The more I forbid, the more you're provoked!
I DO NOT MEAN TO FLIRT, MARQUIS!
Don't confuse one organ with another --
Who's to say I did not?
I FUCKED HER COUNTLESS TIMES! IN EVERY ORIFICE! AND ALL THE WHILE, SHE PLEAD FOR MORE --
If you don't mind my asking... why has the Emperor taken such sudden interest in my... our... affairs?
He's made a great success of our Little Theater; there's seldom an empty seat. Not to mention its therapeutic value.
Why is he in your care, and not a proper prison?
He no longer roars or spits. He no longer taunts the guards or molests his fellow wards --
He's more than a patient, Doctor; the Marquis is my friend --
It was not inspired by circumstance.
If only blood will appease you, then shed mine.
As you say, Doctor.
Will you sleep soundly tonight?
I've stared into the face of evil...  ...and I've lived to tell the tale. Now... for your own sake... let me write it down.
His wife was trying to escape; they caught her on the stair, and set upon her with bayonets.  "There but for the grace of God"... eh, Doctor?
You asked my name once; it's Madeleine.
My darling, Eugenie, dainty morsel! Get on your back! Let's try it dorsal!
And then -- to prove your truly mine -- I'll plunder you, darling, from behind!
"The vigor with which he made love caused her bones to dislodge. Still, he granted her the highest compliment he accorded any woman..."
I'm only a laundress; not a detective.
You're more than a priest; you're an angel! Ain't he, Maddy?
The unhappy tale of a virginal laundry lass, the darling of the lower wards, where they entomb the criminally insane.
What have they done to you now?
"...your wife."
You're aware, are you not, that it costs a great deal to house your husband at Charenton...
Perhaps if you were to buttress your entreaties with the means to oblige them...
If you're truly determined to step out of the shadow of your husband's celebrity --
-- words alone are insufficient.
Good God, Marquise --
Public scorn carries a terrible sting. Trust me. I'm a woman who knows.
You're just scared.
Of being found out. Of not being a genius
That poor woman.
God, these parties are the worst
I did my best but, well, you know me
Uh-huh
Who are you, sir?
The actor
Louis
Oh, why is that?
How bad is it?
A million dollars a year on art and st-st-statues and there's nothing to explain?!
Did you need it? Did you need any of it?
I just want to understand--
castle -- still fighting old battles he will never win with Pulitzer and Roosevelt and Hollywood--
You're not going to get another chance, boy! Look right at the monster and you tell him--
But you keep coming up with the same elitist crap - - HEART OF DARKNESS with a million dollar budget?! - - no one wants to see that.
Magic
How about Howard Hughes? We could do Hughes
The great Spanish bullfighter
Jesus
Here you are, up with the birds for once, you vampire!
Oh for Christ's sake-
Now remember he's a public figure who sought out that publicity so legally he can't stop us from--
What?
I want you back
I'm sorry.
Well, at least she's off KANE today
Is that from one of the Gospels?
You know, all this nightmare we went through with Hearst. The whole thing... And in the end, probably no one will ever remember the picture anyway.
You're lying to me.
A "Z" and a "K" in the title. That would draw the eye. For the poster. I like that THE PRISONER OF ZENDA had a "Z" and a "P" and that worked--
Do WAR OF THE WORLDS as a feature and everyone's happy. You make some money and New York's happy and you have a track record and then we'll move on to KANE.
The magazines are one thing -- but Hedda! Why did we have to let her come?!
Listen to me. The press ban is killing us and the distributors won't book it. And meantime I'm dealing with the stockholders in New York who are scared shitless -- and I'm this far from getting fired myself -- and you don't have a friend in the world but me right now. So you have got to trust that I'll do what I can to--
Well it' s all you've got !
It was the best, kid
Oh, no--
They wanna talk to you.
Hey champ!
What is it with you? Can't you talk? You got like a funny attitude. I can't figure you out, Joey. What's with you and the quick answers? You wanna get outa here fast?
He's an embarrassment because Frankie and the other guys are expectin' me to do something about it, and I'm lookin' very bad. I can't deliver a kid from my own neighborhood. Why's he make it so hard on himself? He comes to me, I can make it easier for him.
I'm gonna kill him. That fuckin' jig's gonna wish he never came outa the jungle. You got any money?
It looks done. I'll take it the way it is.
J.R., glad you could make it.
Yeah, I really cleaned up on him.
Jack, I got no gloves.
And that hard-on, Salvy. Who's he think he is? I'm gonna let that fuckin' hard-on come up here and act like a big shot.
Who's that?
Whadda ya mean, whadda I care? Who is she? What's a matter? You afraid I'm gonna take her on you?
I'm tellin' you, she'll be there, I know she'll be there.
I'm tellin' you, she'll be there, I know she'll be there. Dressed up and everything.
He fights the toughest guys around that everybody else is afraid to fight...
They robbed us! Those fuckin' judges -- What the fuck fight were they watching? If I see them on the street, I'll break their heads. Decision Robinson, my fuckin' ass! Those judges give him the decision 'cause he's goin in the army next week! How else could this have happened?... What do you think they gave him the decision for, that's why.
Nah, she would never...
Whatcha doin'?
I'm gonna order up some stuff. Have a steak.
What? I just said hello. Since when I can't kiss my sister-in-law?
Well, you're not supposed to kiss your mother on the mouth.
Answer me somethin'. What happened at the Copa with Salvy when I was out of town?
I did keep an eye...
But you said "you."
Was Vickie part of the deal with Tommy? Was my wife part of the deal? Tell me, was that it?
I'm pulling out of next Wednesday's TV bout 'cause I can't make the weight. I'm fighting at light heavyweight, and I still can't make the weight.
It ain't worth it, Jake. Get out.
Nine o'clock.
You don't talk very much.
That's it. Just grip up a little tighter. That's it. You're gonna be real good at this. How does that feel?
Can you see it?
What're you lookin' at? You lookin' at him?
Don't tell me "No." I saw you lookin' at him. Why, you like him?
Then why'd you say that thing about Tony Janiro?
You don't kiss like that. Hello and goodbye, that's all you do.
But Jake... I didn't say anything...
Where you been all day?
What'd you see?
What was it about?
Come out of there! Did you fuck Salvy?  Answer me. Open this fuckin' door, you fuckin' cunt!  Who've you been fuckin'?
You're killing him. You're killing him for nothing. Stop it.
Sure, what else is new?
Open the door, Vickie.
Aw, c'mon. Don't say that.
Can't you get the money from your friends?
Tomorrow, at the gym. Don't forget.
I said, let's go.
And you're drinking with them right now.
Indo-China -- Jeff predicted it would go sky-high.
Name me a better photographer.
Like disposing of their wives?
It's too stupid and obvious a way to murder -- in full view of fifty windows -- and then sit over there --  -- smoking a cigar -- waiting for the police to pick him up.
I think you saw something -- that probably has a very simple explanation.
I -- uh -- won't report it to the Department. Let me poke into a little on my own. No point in you getting any ridiculous publicity.
She never left the apartment --
Who said they left then?
I hate to remind you -- but this all started because you said she was murdered. Now did anyone, including you, actually see her murdered?
I can't do it even if he's gone.
Now don't get me mad! Even a detective can't walk in anybody's apartment and search it. If I were ever caught in there, I'd lose my badge inside of ten minutes!
One thing I don't need is heckling! You called and asked me for help -- and now you're acting like a taxpayer!
Did you ever own a saw?
If I'd been careful piloting that reconnaissance plane, you wouldn't have taken the kind of pictures that got you a medal, a big job, fame, money --
My Lisa. She went into Thorwald's apartment, and he came back. The only way I could get her out was to call the police.
For what?
Where?
Stop sounding stuffy. I'll take pictures from a jeep. From a water buffalo if necessary.
Like what?
Something wrong?
Hello.
I can't. The police have it by now.
That's normal.
Her father loading up the shotgun?
The insurance Company would be a lot happier if you slept in your bed, not the wheelchair.
Keep your mind off her.
And she'll end up fat, alcoholic and miserable.
Poor girl. Someday she'll find her happiness.
Mrs. Thorwald?
No -- but it makes the rest easy to take. And she's reading the Bible.
No.
What's she trying to do? Why doesn't she turn him in?
It is something really important, Jeff?
How's your leg?
And your stomach?
It's opening night of the last depressing week of L. B. Jefferies in a cast.
Now that's no way to spend your hard- earned money!
What would you think of starting off with dinner at the "21"?
Don't laugh. -- I could do it!
That's what is know as "manless melancholia."
Those high heels would be a lot of use in the jungle -- and those nylons and six-ounce lingerie --
Not that salesman's wife. And why didn't he go to work today?
Sitting around, looking out a window to kill time, is one thing -- but doing it the way you are --  -- with, with binoculars, and with wild opinions about every little movement you see -- is, is diseased!
What is it you're looking for?
Maybe she died.
Lisa, please!
It's pretty hard to stay away from that word isn't is?
That's where he's being clever. Acting nonchalant.
He had it hidden in the dresser! Well, at least it was in there. He took it out, went to the phone and called somebody long distance. -- His wife's jewelry was in the handbag. And something about it worried him. He was asking somebody advice over the phone.
Suppose he doesn't come back again?
Well, I guess it's safe to put on some lights now.
I'd like to see your friend's face when we tell him. He doesn't sound like much of a detective.
Say anything else, and I'll stay tomorrow night too.
You said I'd have to live out of one suitcase  I'll bet yours isn't this small?
From his landlord -- once a month.
Do you suppose it's ethical to watch a man with binoculars, and a long- focus lens -- until you can see the freckles on the back of his neck, and almost read his mail -- do you suppose it's ethical even if you prove he didn't commit a crime?
Whatever happened to that old saying "Love Thy Neighbor."
Do you like it?
Do you think this was worth waiting all day to see?
Shut up. I'm all right.
What's happening?
I thought only punks fought with knives.
You satisfied or you want more?
Any other entrance?
That maid saw us.  She could identify us too.
No.
Tell him why we moved here.
Mother--
So long, young fella.  Knock 'em dead, like your old man used to!
Listen--I took a steak out of the freezer.  I thought we could have a real old-fashioned stag party--just the two of us, what do you say?
Suppose you knew that you had to do something very dangerous--where you have to prove something you need to know--a question of honor.  Would you do it?
What can you do when you have to be a man?
Go ahead.
Will you let him tell it!
You're absolutely right!
Son--this is all happening so fast--
No thanks, I don't smoke.
I'm just explaining what you mean! You can't be an idealist all your life!  Nobody thanks you for sticking your neck out!
Frank?  I'm frightened.
Frank!
John Crawford?
They not together, sir.  We don't see him in a long time now.
I think his first name's Ray--I have to see him.  It's very important.
He's not here.  He's not at Juvenile Hall.  I don't know where he is.  He's out on a call and he'll be out all night.  How old are you?
What's your name!
Are you really going to meet them?
Boy, I bet you'd go to a hanging.
I got to go in.  You better get home too.  Hey--what?
They're looking for you!--
Come out come out wherever you are!
When I was here?  When I ran away. I used to run away a lot but they always took me back.
I'm sorry.
How!
What about the other boys--Do you think they'll go to the police?
Do I have to spell it out?
Get lost.
Too bad you didn't connect.  You could have gone to Juvenile Hall. That's what you want, isn't it?
Go on--don't give me that.  Someone giving you hard looks?
He called me chicken.
They never do.
They think I'll make friends if we move.  Just move and everything'll be roses and sunshine.
A zoo.  He always wants to be my pal, you know?  But how can I give him anything when he's--I mean I love him and I don't want to hurt him--but I don't know what to do anymore except maybe die.
If he could--
Hey!  That's enough static out of you.
Assault with a deadly weapon.
Where's Dawson High School?
Sure.  Lots of times.
You can't talk underwater!
Ever been in a place like this before?
Is this what it's like to love somebody?
Is he your friend?
Children?  Well, we really don't encourage them.  They're so noisy and troublesome, don't you agree?
He makes you feel pretty unhappy?
How did you know that?
Are you and Mom home tonight?
I was talking to Dad.
Why?
Read you're a man of some knowledge.
Is this the fucker you been writing all year!?
IS THIS NICK MASON!!??
Gabriel! You said talk to him. That's all you ever said...
-- till he fucked his parole --
I've been doing good, though.
Didn't have to send me down a fucking mountain.
Saw my outfit or something, my coat --
Thought you wrote you had a mustache.
Well, I don't know about that --
Security, Ash, I just worked security. They wouldn't be rolling out the red carpet --
When'd you decide to do it, Ash? After which of his letters, huh? The fortieth? The fiftieth? The first?!
Nick, please, it's me --
Your pen palls dead, lady.
...maybe I die for Nick...
I thought we'd have a few more days.
Since when do some trucker pals start thinking big, anyway?
And I'm his ticket.  What's the last place they took down?
Then they do need me, don't they. They really need me...
Nick, what happened --
Jesus Christ, stay here, don't move, stay right here --
He says he wants it now.
How are we gonna do this, Nick?
No.
I don't know where you're going. But I'm going home.
No --
But I never said Rudy.
Who are you now.
So you could get down her chimney.
Where's she work?
What's her middle name?
What'd they call her in college?
What's her greatest fear?
Let's get back on the road. It's time to start talking, Nick. Time to start telling tales --
What the fuck are you talking about.
They won't recognize me.
Trust me. They won't recognize me.
Bring back some memories, Nick?
Y'know what, guys? I woke up this morning, I got a really lucky feeling going on. I mean it, I'm feeling that good. I wouldn't be surprised if I walk in there, pull a handle and hit jackpot. Hell, we wouldn't even have to --
What'd you tell that casino manager?
Start singing.
NO.
No gun.
You gotta be kidding me.
You are lucky, convict. You're spending Christmas with the birthday boy himself --
Buncha guys in red suits busted in, they'll say. Started shooting. They won't be able to remember... if it was three, or four... or five. Four dead Santas and some burned-up cash. Merry Christmas, The End.
Who's robbin' who here, Gabriel...
The Powwow Safe where you steal your money! Where you cheat your Indians!
I can't go back to Vegas...
The Powwow Safe. The secret safe. You said the manager's got a safe in his office where he hides skim money.
Goddamn, Merlin. There any part of the day you don't smoke?
That motherfucker --
Knew a guy in Joliet, smoked ten packs a day like you. His lungs got so black they couldn't find 'em with an x-ray.
This trucker? Met a girl in a bar one night, she didn't know his situation. He's drunk, she's drunk, they get to mackin' hot and heavy and the woman swallows it. His tongue. Sucks it right down.
I got a bacon too; there another bacon in there?
How long ago was your makeover?
You want that for here or to go?
Buffet. Whaddya think it is?
What the hell was that about --
What's the first thing, man? What's the first thing you're gonna do?
For twenty-five, she sounds pretty mature.
She's using a new perfume.
Just taste that Christmas turkey.
Tell her... I'll be there ...
That was my king!
Then get yourself another table! You're hitting Santa's cards and you're taking Santa's money!
Watch your mouth, man. It's Christmas.
Alone at last.
I asked you a question. Are you clear about that?
You fuckin' wish.
He is a motherfucker. He won't let me leave the halfway house till I get some piece of shit job.
I'll call somebody.
Didn't I tell ya not to worry?  Vic was worried.
Daddy, I'm sorry, I don't know what's happening.
Would you stop it with that shit! You beat on this prick enough, he'll tell ya he started the Chicago fire. That don't necessarily make it so. Okay, first things fucking last, where's the shit? Please tell me somebody brought something with them.
Go ahead and laugh, you know what I mean. What a while bitch will put up with, a black bitch won't put up with for a minute. They got a line, and if you cross it, they fuck you up.
The black Beverly Hills. I knew this lady from Ladora Heights once.  "Hi, I'm from Ladora Heights, it's the black Beverly Hills."
No, it wasn't Pam Grier, Pam Grier was the other one. Pam Grier made the movies. Christie Love was like a Pam Grier TV show, without Pam Grier.
He's right about the ear, it's hacked off.
Say "hello" to a motherfucker who's inside. Cabot's doing a job and take a big fat guess who he wants on the team?
Nice Guy. When we got to the bar...
The Boots and Socks in Gardena. When we got there, I met Joe and a guy named Mr. White. It's a phony name. My name's Mr. Orange.
The way they talk to each other. You can tell they're buddies.
Me and Mr. White?
What's this?
I gotta memorize all this shit?
Tell me more about Cabot.
...Her brother usually goes with her, but he's in county unexpectedly.
I'm sorry.
Who's your parole officer?
I just want you to know, Joe, how much I appreciate your care packages on the inside.
Toby... who the fuck is Toby? Toby... Toby... think... think... think...
Hey, fuck all that, I'm making a point here. You're gonna make me lose my train of thought.
Why can't we pick out our own colors?
Nobody's trading with anybody! Look, this ain't a goddamn fuckin' city counsel meeting! Listen up Mr. Pink. We got two ways here, my way or the highway. And you can go down either of 'em. So what's it gonna be, Mr. Pink?
Mr. Blue's dead?
Two minutes, tops. It's a tough two minutes. It's daylight, during business hours, dealing with a crowd. But you'll have the guys to deal with the crowd.
Around twenty. Security pretty lax. They almost always just deal in boxes. Rough uncut stones they get from the syndicate. On a certain day this wholesaler's gettin' a big shipment of polished stones from Israel. They're like a way station. They are gonna get picked up the next day and sent to Vermont.
Mr. Pink?  Why?
Your name's Freddy something.
Look, I don't wanna be a fly in the ointment, but if help doesn't come soon, I gotta see a doctor. I don't give a fuck about jail, I just don't wanna die.
I wasn't born yesterday. I'm hurt, and I'm hurt bad.
Whaddaya mean you don't tip?
I don't even know a Jew who'd have the balls to say that. So let's get this straight. You never ever tip?
How the fuck do you think? The cops shot him.
As opposed to good?
Okay, let's go through what happened. We're in the place, everything's going fine. Then the alarm gets tripped. I turn around and all these cops are outside. You're right, it was like, bam! I blink my eyes are they're there. Everybody starts going apeshit. Then Mr. Blonde starts shootin' all the -
No real people?
Nope.
So who's the rat this time? Mr. Blue? Mr. Blonde? Joe? It's Joe's show, he set this whole thing up. Maybe he set it up to set it up.
Oh, you and Joe go back a long time. I known Joe since I was a kid. But me saying Joe definitely couldn't have done it is ridiculous. I can say I definitely didn't do it, cause I know what I did or didn't do. But I can't definitely say that about anybody else, 'cause I don't definitely know. For all I know, you're the rat.
We ain't taking him to a hospital.
Cut the bullshit, we ain't on a fuckin' playground!  I don't believe this shit, both of you got ten years on me, and I'm the only one actin like a professional. You guys act like a bunch of fuckin' niggers. You ever work a job with a bunch of niggers? They're just like you two, always fightin', always sayin' they're gonna kill one another.
Okay, Mr. Expert. If this is such a truism, how come every nigger I know treats his woman like a piece of shit?
What's the matter with her?
And this is Helen Carter.
There's a nice boy.
I didn't know anything about her except she wanted a job because some man had left her stranded. I couldn't leave her in the street. Let's go.
We can't stay here!
I'm sorry, but that's how it's got to be.
Don't you trust me?
Why did you change your mind about bringing us along?
You wouldn't do a thing like that, would you?
No, I'm not all right. I'm soaked and I hit myself against that rock.
Go on, take it. Then you can't spend the rest of the trip expecting to get paid.
Some of 'em you didn't mean but most of 'em you did. I don't blame you because I understand your way of thinking and why you think that way. You want your women on pedestals. But they have to be born on 'em -- they can fall off but they can't climb back up.
I'm fool enough to believe that one of these days somebody will. Somebody who wants me as I am will maybe walk into the place where I'm working and take me out of there.
Because... well, you said you wanted a man to think enough of you to walk in the place you were working and take you out of there... tonight I was sort of tied up with Steve... but tomorrow I figured on doing just that.
You never said this Lednov's name before, that I can remember.
Do you have to be so close-mouthed? I'm your brother. And I'm ridin' with you. Remember?
There was only three of them at first. I guess I lost my head.
They were quite a ways off and the wind was blowin'. I didn't have them to aim.
Okeh, I was wrong. But you can't expect a fellow who never saw Lednov and never heard his name until a while ago to do too much worryin'. You've been sorta close mouthed about him.
Leaving them here when we could just as well take them. We got plenty of room in the wagon. And -- and -- they cook and drive the mules. They don't bother anybody.
Want the wagon unloaded, Clay?
Kind of feeling your oats this morning. I haven't laid a hand on you for quite a while, but that doesn't mean you're too old.
What did you come back for?
You'll live.
You can light the lamp.  I'm sure glad it's you. We were afraid those killers might come back.
I can't take her with me.
Don't act so -- crazy.
Helen -- why don't you and Mary go on with Clay?
Of course I do -- but it'd be better for you -- and the house is kind of small --
It isn't that --
That something I shouldn't see?
I saw your fire and dropped by to say hello.
And you're all alone.
Aspen doesn't want us Mr. Graham. They threw us out.
You think that's all we busted -- You should see...
It isn't like this was the first place we were ever thrown out of.
We don't want to go there.
I'm sure of this. But not of you.  You won't open any joint. I've been watching you change. You're mad now and you think you can change back. But you can't. You'll end up making beds in a boarding house.
Mary, Honey. I talked too much, like always -- he thinks you told Elaine the things I told her.
You said somebody was comin' back -- who's comin' back?
Clay Phillips.
I said let's go.
Why, yes. They're all I need...
That won't help the stone bruise. You ain't been around horses much, looks like.
Maybe I could start you out.
Then I know my alphabet.
U-n-i-c-o-r-n-... What in heck's that?
An' if you can't hunt 'em and even if you could they'd be tough, what's the use of knowin' how to spell them?
Well, Steve?
She was only teasin'.
For the last ten miles I've been trying to figure out how to sleep sitting up. I'm getting to the point where I don't think there's any place named Sonora.
You stretch out. I'll fix something to eat.
Hey, Brenda.
Oh my God! We're dead!
Hello Brenda.
Shhh... It's okay.
You sure?
Ray, run faster.
Whoa, check this out. She looks like you.
Let's get outta here.
Yes...
What are we gonna do? I'm cold. I can't move, I'm so cold.
Feel that?
Better try a little higher.
There's something I really want to share with you.
Look, what I'm trying to say --
Hey, look out, a bee!
Okay, I get the point.
Ray, you saved my life. Are you okay?
Oh my God! I'm here with the...
I'm Cindy.
Tell me, Cindy. Would you ever tell me "Stop. If you loved me you'd stop."
It was you...
This can't be happening?
Noooo!!!
Would you like me to help you pass them back?
Father!
You could use the grade, huh?
Did you do that?
I finished all the interviews.
So, if one of our little chickadees is taking a shower which one of these buttons do I press to get a close- up?
I'm going to change for dinner. I'll see you shortly.
Not to worry. There's been no reported activity in the house for over twenty years.
Professor, I think you should see this.
What the hell?!
The Professor might have everyone else fooled, but I know who the real brains of the operation is.
She's gotten worse, Father. She won't eat, she won't talk. The child won't even let me touch her.
Father.
Sit down and join us, Cindy.
This part removes the sense of humor.
I woke up naked, too.
Yo' Tommy, what up, man?
Oh, boy! 
Mrs. Sutphin?
...Jenner... Jenson, Emy Lou Jenson. 3511 Clark Avenue!
I wouldn't give ya a nickel.
Yes murdered! You said you hated your teacher yesterday and he was murdered too. I don't know... maybe Mom's nuts!
Carl's a jerk!
No comment!
Oh God, really!  This is the limit!
Bye, Birdie.  Chip, honey... I know it's hard being a teenager but I understand... I'm your mother and I love you.
Ladies and gentlemen, the perfect meatloaf!
Carl makes me happy and that threatens this family, doesn't it?
Hi, Hank.
Look at this!  "Hillside Strangler gets his college degree in prison!"
Sorry, son.  This is a matter for adults.
Nothing like a home cooked meal, honey.
I can't stop thinking about that poor teacher.  Goodnight, honey. Don't read late, we've got a big day with the birds tomorrow.
I love that you're my wife.
Beverly, I've been reading all about it... is it menopause?
Objection! Argumentative!
Who is this?
What exactly does this sick individual say to you?
MOTHERFUCKER!!
Dottie! Watch what you're doing!
So you do drink?
Yummy. Carl says if I lose ten pounds, he'll take me to the University of Maryland Fall Mixer.
Mrs. Ackerman, when you left me at the flea-market, where did you go?
Mrs. Sutphin, I'm Paul Stubbins, Chip's math teacher.
Chip is off to a fine start this year.  Focused... conscientious... participates actively in classroom discussion.
Certainly not!
I don't know what it is about today, but I FEEL GREAT!
That girl was looking for Jacqueline Gibson. I'd forget it if I were you.
I don't like this.
You scared?
We can't stand here all night.
Then, you also understand that you must die.
I'm afraid she can't do that, Ward. It would endanger her.
How much does she want?
About forty-five dollars.
Well, don't worry. I saw Miss Jacqueline only a week ago. I saw her at a little restaurant the boy friend took me to -- an Italian place down in the Village --	"The Dante."
It's on Peary Street. Just ask the people who run it. They'll remember her.  People who see Miss Jacqueline never forget her.
The tip is, anyhow. I like to work on your hair.
What were you talking about?
We're not exactly strangers, Mary. Jacqueline spoke about you often. I suppose she told you about me,
A man would look anywhere for her, Mary. There is something exciting and unforgettable about her -- something you never get hold of -- something that keeps a man following after her.
This is about another murder -- a woman at Fifty Second Street
I'm sorry. I didn't intend to treat you like a child.
Who the devil is he?
You could have told me any time you were Jacqueline's husband.
Good night, Jacqueline -- good night, Mary.
But I'm not joking.
Mary, when you first came here, I told you to look into your heart. You didn't listen to me. You listened to the policeman instead. You didn't find your sister, did you?
Well?
Could you find him?
What's that?
Please, Jacqueline.
It's terribly sweet of you, Jason.
That's it. And this figure --she traced it. The book I saw at the library had been marked "perfect" by the library inspector in March. Mrs. Redi had it out in April. No one else had read it since.
Look. I'm serious. It's a real and vary earnest society -- a dangerous society...
I want you to see my room. I want you to see all of it.
It's not a searchlight -- it's a sword blade cutting the blue cloak of a prince -- not stars --
Jason, my pet --
Why can't everyone be happy like we are -- laugh and have good times. Look at that poor little one - so sad because she can't find her sister. And that man with her -- he doesn't make her laugh -- he just sits and talks.
Tell me where Jacqueline is -- we've got to find her.
I know the others -- Redi, Fallon, Leo, Bruns. But I would never have guessed it of you, Natalie.
I know the theory behind the movement. If one believes in good one believes in evil. If one believes in God, one must believe in the devil. And an intelligent person can make his own choice -- that's it, isn't it?
I was a great dancer...
There's nothing you can think of -- old letters, anything, that might give me some hint as to where I might find Jacqueline?
Once you'd seen my sister you'd never forget her.
Yes -- yes, if she made that much impression on you, I'm sure it was Jacqueline.
You mean she just came here, rented the room, locked it, and left?
But, Mrs. Lowood, I can't just stay here not knowing what's happened to my sister. Maybe if I went to New York -- if I saw Mrs. Redi myself --
I'm worry to bother you. I want to ask you about my sister.
I thought you might know her. She was seen here about a week ago. Her name is Jacqueline Gibson.
I'll be right back with Mrs. Wheeler.
But he also wrote --
It is a very real danger and one which forces our decision.
No, I think you look... fine.
You mean like "time flies"?
That's hard to believe. The two of you seem so different.
I don't know.
Yeah, I know. I mean, I'm not saying I know people think you're a bitch, I'm saying I know what you mean. And I don't even know that people think you're a bitch. Do they?
Why is that?
You're what?
Does it bother you?
Well... are you self-conscious about it?
Excuse me for asking, but how would you know?
So since I've never had sex with you, by your own advice I shouldn't accept your advice.
What are these?
Donna?
Because I enjoy interviewing women more than men.
You know?
What will you do when the money runs out?
You don't know what I'm thinking.
I don't see what difference it makes, I mean, I can think what I want.  I don't know if I want to do this anymore, I'm afraid... I don't mind answering the questions so much, but if somebody were to see this...
I guess not.
That's correct.
How could I, with all these nice people stopping by? The fact is that I've lived by myself for so long, I can't imagine living with another person. It's amazing what you can get used to if enough time goes by. And anyway, I'm asking the questions. Are you happy?
Did you confront John with the fact that you knew about him?
And you feel the same way with John?
You're really never going to make love again?
But if you were?
So why won't you make love with me? Why wouldn't you, I mean?
Who? Elizabeth?
Look at you, look at what's happened to you, look how you've changed! Don't you think she will have changed?
Don't do that.
Graham and I were talking about apartments and I told him to check the Garden District, there are some nice little places there, garage apartments and stuff.
Yes. I just got busy.
Something wrong?
No, I'm not. Frankly, I'm offended at the accusation.
There's nothing to know, Ann.
Ann, you are completely paranoid. Not ten minutes ago I wanted to make love for the first time in weeks, and you act like I'm dipped in shit. You know, I think there are a lot of women that would be glad to have a young, straight male making a pretty good living beside them in bed with a hard on.
I don't know. Sometimes I feel stupid babbling about my little problems while children are starving in the world.
Jesus Christ! What the hell happened? I came home and your car was gone, the door was open, I thought for sure you'd been abducted by some mad fucker, I was literally just calling the cops when you walked in. What happened?
What?
You son of a bitch!!
When did you begin having this feeling?
God, no.
What brought this on?
You understand that you are free to leave therapy at any time?
Do you want to leave therapy?
What are you talking about?
Why? Just give me the address, you won't even have to be involved.
No, I didn't.
Questions about sex.
Well, it's too late now, isn't it?
In front of him, Ann, yes.
Why?
I feel like I do.
I was just trying to --
I get real busy between two and four.
Bye.
No, I really can't. I find it healthy never to characterize people I don't know or conversations I haven't heard. I don't know what you and your sister discussed about me or anything else. Last time I saw Ann she left here very... confused, I would say. And upset.
And are you here to berate me for making her that way?
She didn't tell you why she was upset?
How did you find me?
Nope. I think the man is a liar.
What makes you think I'd discuss that with you?
You just want to ask me questions?
Would anybody else see the tape?
And you ask questions, right?
Do I sit or stand?
Your first sexual experience.
How unfortunate. So when did you finally get to see a penis?
What about when you touched it? What did you expect it to feel like, and then what did it really feel like?
Do you think I'm pretty?
Look, I'm just going to come right out and tell you why I'm here, okay?
I never do more than one. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I can't do it.
I've got to get back to the office.
You should be. Can I meet this friend of yours?
Hello.
When?
Jesus. I could almost understand it if he was screwing these people, almost. Why doesn't he just buy some magazines or porno movies or something?
Why not?
Yeah, I do. A helluva lot more than I trust you.
Oh, please. Come on, John. You're fucking your wife's sister and you hardly been married a year. You're a liar. But at least I know you're a liar. It's the people that don't know, like Ann, that have to watch out.
That's right. But I never took a vow in front of God and everybody to be "faithful" to my sister.
John, we have nothing to talk about.
Plus first and last month deposit.
Everybody has a past.
I'm sorry. Am I prying again?
What tapes?
Your keys, asshole!! Your two fucking keys!! Give them to me!!
Mr. Millaney?
He said immediately.
...probably nothing at all. It's probably just a bunch of, I don't know, fatty cysts. You can have them removed in a doctor's office. Has Nick seen a doctor?
Hi.
You knew these people?
Kiss, kiss?
She had a couple just like them. Right here near her belly button. You could push 'em around. I thought they were kinda sexy, myself.
It was women did it to Hobbes. Couldn't handle them. That girl, that Annabelle -- talk about crazy projects.
He didn't make it.
GOT MY HEM SO HIGH THEY'LL SAY I'M BEING CHEEKY
BREAKING OUT
Later, Brenda.  Ah, Bert, could you spare a moment?
Infantile regression.
Introduce yourselves.
I know he's boring but... Neuro-specialists!  That sounds pretty drastic.
When do I get to see Brad?
Out of self comes selflessness.
Conspiracy?  That sounds a little farfetched.
Overreact!  You're the one with theories about conspirac...  Oliver?
Betty, it's imperative we get Janet out of Flavors' fast fingers and Brad out of that hell-hole before they both disappear forever. If only I could place that name -- McKinley?
I'll leave you young things to it.
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR COMPASSION
Mental instability?
What are you talking about? Danny Slepstrini is a chip off the old block.  I played 18 holes of golf with his father just last week.  And Hank says Danny's moved to New York.  To better himself.
Mr.  Flavors -- may I have a moment of your time?
I won't be a party to this.  I want to see Brad.
You shouldn't have said that.
I NEED SOME
I want to see Brad.
Is it true they're all midgets with big heads?
He will.  But it's up to you to reawaken his feelings.  You've got to be fabulous, look, think and appear fabulous.  And Farley's given you that chance.  You can use the Breakfast Show to knock Denton dead.
You've got a really tight team around you.  And everybody needs you!
Our field.
YOU FEL LIKE CHOKING YOU PLAY FOR BROKE...
HE LEAVES YOU SMOKING...
THIS COULD BE THE START OF A WHOLE NEW CAREER HERE
And we also know how you feel, we're not strangers to confusion.
And you liked fucking him, didn't you, you fat little whore?
Why are you being so defensive?
Bye.
How's the trip?
Lot of good stuff.  Got the new Bien Nacido. Want a taste?
What do you think?
Glass or bottle?
Yeah, well, you should be my agent.
Spray and Wash. That's the one.
What happened to you guys?
Hi.
Why did you tell them my book was being published?
Just tell me.
Did you read the latest draft, by the way?
This Saturday, Mom, remember? We told you.
Speak for yourself. I get chicks looking at me all the time. All ages.
No. No. You've been officially depressed for like two years now, and you were always a negative guy anyway, even in college. Now it's worse -- you're wasting away. Teaching English to fucking eighth-graders when they should be reading what you wrote. Your books.
These guys make top-notch Pinot and Chardonnay. One of the best producers in Santa Barbara county.  Look how beautiful this view is. What a day!
Hey, Miles. I really hope your novel sells.
That's what you do with every one.
Hey Jack, hurry up!
We should have driven.
You think I'm making a mistake marrying Christine?
We're not getting any younger, right? And my career, well, it's gotten pretty, you know, frustrating. Even with my new manager. Maybe it's time to settle down.
Jesus, she's jammin'. And she likes you. What else do you know about her?
Ooooooohh. Now we're getting somewhere.
So what're we going to have? Pigs in a blanket? The "rancher's special breakfast"? Or maybe just some grease and fat with a side of lard?
She called Maya, who's not working tonight, so we're all going out.
And if they want to drink Merlot, we're drinking Merlot.
Pull yourself together, man.
Oh, hey, change of plans. Steph's off today, so she and I are going on a hike.
Right now.
Being with Stephanie has opened my eyes. She's not uptight or controlling. She's just cool. Things are so easy with her. Smells different. Tastes different. Fucks different. Fucks like an animal. I'm telling you, I went deep last night, Miles. Deep.
This is totally different. I'm talking about avoiding what you're talking about. That's the distinction. I have not made the commitment yet. I am not married. I have not said the words. In a few days, I might get married, and if I do, then I won't be doing stuff like this anymore. Otherwise, what's the whole point of getting married?
What do you care anyway? You don't even like Christine.
Listen, I'm going to make sure Steph and Siena get home safe, and then maybe we'll hook up with you later, okay?
Call me on my cell if you go out.
That's a public course.  No Stephanie?
Did you ever got ahold of Maya yesterday?
Nice shot.
What is it?
Just don't give up on Maya. Cool smart chicks like that --they like persistence.
We're on.
So tell me everything. Details. I like details.
This whole week has gone sour. It isn't turning out like it was supposed to.  I want to go home.
We gotta slow down.  I'm so tired. Let's just get out of here.
How about this one? We didn't hit this one.
Let me use your phone.
Don't give up. You're going to make it.
You sure you didn't say anything to Maya?
She gets off in an hour, so I think I'm just going to have a drink and then... make sure she gets home safe.
Her husband works a night shift or something, and he comes home, and I'm on the floor with my cock in his wife's ass.
No. She ordered them special. Took her forever to find them. They've got this design on them with dolphins and our names engraved in Sanskrit. We've got to go back. Christine'll fucking crucify me.
Yep. Quite a day.
Uh-uh. You're on your own.
Love you, man.
What are you drinking?
On a Sauvignon Blanc?
Wow. We gotta give it a moment, but this is tasty. Really good. How about you?
So is it kind of about death and mortality, or...?
Like me, I have this stupid paper due on Friday, and as usual I'm freaked out about it. Just like in high school. It never changes.
Bathroom over there?
I had a good time tonight, Miles. I really did.
I had class.
You guys should stop by the restaurant for lunch today.
About two-thirty.
No, we've got to get back Friday for the rehearsal dinner.
He's an actor, so it can't be good.
Oh, Maya. No.
Hi. It's Maya. Please leave a message.
You quit drinking?
Cabernet Franc.  This is only the fifth year we've made this varietal. Very few wineries around here do a straight Cabernet Franc. It's from our vineyard up in Santa Maria. And it was a Silver Medal winner at Paso Robles last year.
What's everyone ordering? Then we can sort out the wine.
Anything but the Jayer Richebourg!
So what are you up to today, Miles?
Huh.
Oops. Sorry.
Me? No, I think it's kind of a stupid game. I mean, at least, I could never get into it. I tried it once.
See you, Miles. You take care.
Stephanie! Stop!
A famous actor who's getting married next week.
Yeah, well. You know, Jack's pretty eager to get up to... you know, but, uh, yeah. We'll see how it goes.
What's wrong with the water next to your bed?
A hair.
I'm scared.
Does it hurt?
...Tell Graham --
You do?
It was very dark.
It was very dark.
Morgan, be careful.
This is going to do nothing.
He was only a year and half old.
They're distracting us?
How do they know it's over?
He's not strong enough to fight off another attack.
We might lose the signal.
Tell me something Morgan. In that book of your, did they happen to detail what would happen if they were hostile?
We'll have to board up the bedroom doors.
What's that?
It's not broken.
Let me ask you two something. Don't be embarrassed by the answer. It is possible... Just possible now, you might have been chasing each other around? You said you went in opposite directions.
See Father, Ray's truck swerved off the road and ah... Hit Colleen and then a tree. She was pinned between the two.
Some guy had a sign that said it was the end of the world.  Nothing really bad is going to happen, is it Uncle Merrill?
All I did was kiss a girl.
Well, no, not exactly. See then his friend opened up on me.
Well, Kate, it was self-defense sure enough, but I think you'd have to say I killed old Murdo. I think that's definitely the word.
That's all over as far as I'm concerned, Emmett. I'm satisfied.
Kate?
More than enough.
Goodbye?
Are you all right?
We told Sheriff Cobb about the attack.  He said he'd... look into it.  I can't believe he's the law out here. Now I see why you all wear guns.
I guess tomorrow at dawn he'll be proved right.
I've never been in there. They just jumped you out of the blue?
Me, I'm riding along, minding my own business. Four cowboys come by and we decide to ride together for a while, friendly as can be. I always figure you might as well approach life like everybody's your friend or nobody is... don't make much difference. We get out in the middle of that frying pan and suddenly everybody's pointing their gun but me. I guess they admired my horse. She's a great one, a sweet little bay.
Women?
Shame about the kid. Seems a lively sort.
Then I guess this is where we part ways. Sorry.
Where you been?
You own this land.
Never will again.
Mr. and Mrs. Parker have agreed to join their parcel to mine. We'll work them together.  Mine starts right over there. It's all I've ever wanted. Pretty land, isn't it?
It was not -- it was Murdo's. Those McKendricks don't know how to act like human beings.
You mean you ain't coming with Emmett and me?
This a friend of yours?
New record.
You wanted to see me?
What's all this then?
He was murdered.
What's stopping you?
This is it, gents. My ma told me to head south past that rock.
He must be pretty good.
This is mighty sweet, Paden. I think I finally found my place in the world.
Good old Paden. I was hoping you'd changed your mind about the job.
What is it you want from me?
I'm a great believer in doing nothing.
I never could count on you to be reasonable.  Don't force me to make an adjustment around here.
You work here?
Nifty.
You wouldn't be needing any help around here, would you? Maybe with the gambling?
Stella, this is one of my oldest surviving friends. Treat him right.
Can you tell us why you were disposing of the body of a woman who didn't exist?
I can't imagine how you ever let a man like that go.  I owe Viktor everything.
My God, are you alright, Simone?
Of course she is.  No other name is going to sign on now and risk offending her.
It's the truth.  Those 17 superstars are our insurance policy.  We can't open -- can't make a profit without them.
You realize you're nostalgic for an era you weren't even born in?
-- It's called a projector.
The picture's dead.
They're yours.  But how are you going to finish it?  Without a star there's no movie.
Don't be ridiculous.  I arranged a press conference.
Really?  Oh, so she's really going to do all this nudity?
Well, we have to do something about this -- "stuntwoman".
Even the fall from the plane?
Stunning, Viktor.  The Hollywood Foreign Press is going to eat this up.
Yes.  To be honest I never quite saw this film before -- maybe it's the way Simone is playing it -- but what it's saying about the illusion of permanence in everyday life, how that's the only way we can love -- I think it's really going to mean something.
-- It's starting to look like she doesn't support the film or you, Viktor.  If you can't handle her, I will.
She doesn't want pity.
Really?
As a matter-of-fact I am.
About now.  Would you like a drink?
But you don't understand.  She'll always be there -- at some party, on some magazine cover, some song on the radio, up on some screen.
Where are you?
Mom, do you miss Dad?
Let's go, Lainey.  There's nothing here.
God, it's so like your father.  Why can't people take responsibility for their actions anymore?  I can almost forgive him for killing Simone -- but denying her existence.  I can never forgive that.
Of course.  What are you suggesting?
I can't believe she's doing this -- taking advantage of him this way. It's cruel.
"Why are we here?  Is that what you're asking, Jack?... Why are we here?  No why.  Just here".
Don't I know it.  That's the only reason I'm here now -- to put the attention back where it belongs, on Mr. Taransky's film.
Nudity has just never been an issue for me, Frank.  For me, clothes are just an option.
-- Simone, the question on everyone's mind is simply... "why?"
And still the connection was undeniable.  I haven't read "Eternity Forever" but I know it's brilliant.  And I know I would be perfect for Clive.
Yes, perfect.  As a matter of fact, I ran into Simone on the lot the other day.
Hal, what are you doing?
You can't.
You know I sometimes forget she has bodily functions.
I have her, Mr. Taransky.  The answer to your prayers.  The answer to this.
It's me, Mr. Taransky.  Don't you recognize me? -- The Future of Film conference in San Jose. Hank... Hank Aleno.  I was keynote speaker.  You must remember my speech... "Who Needs Humans?"
An eye -- for performance.  You know the truth when you see it.  I know.  I've seen your movies.  I love your movies.
I won't be here next week.  The tumor's inoperable.  I'll be dead.
I'm sorry Mom canned you.
Don't feel too bad.  Mom runs the place and they still walk all over her.  You're better off out of it.
She still with Kent?
Can't you stop that?
Those things can be dangerous. Staring at a screen all day -- you miss what's going on outside in the real world.  You can lose yourself. You should get out more.  How are you going to meet boys?
Dad, you know I don't like to get between you and mom but she's feeling down right now.  She broke up with Kent.
Too impersonal.  They have to meet face-to-face.
-- I can't accept it.  I don't want a car, Dad.
Don't you have a real story to write?  Why aren't you in Latin America?
I know that's what you'd like us to believe.  But I got to tell you -- embezzlement is a serious matter. Not to mention abduction.
Alright, Sayer, you've got a deal.
What now, Sayer?
That doesn't prove a thing -- wait until I get a court order for a blood test.
Is it a jamming device?
Whatever it is, it's dark.
Of course -- no one's that perfect, that pure.  You know I had something on Mother Teresa.  But then she died and it wasn't worth it anymore.  I know how to flush out this Simone -- a tell-all story from her childhood.
-- Is this about the new pages? -- I made the changes you wanted, you're in virtually every scene --
Would you like me to read?
You know you're really very good. I take back what I said.  I mean, you're really good.
I am the death of real.
You're going to get in a lot of trouble, Mr. Taransky.
Mahogany. I'd say that cost at least a couple hundred. Maybe three.
Wow. They called you their son.
I just needed to do a couple of things.  And I needed to tell you something.
You know that's probably not the best idea. I'll just wait to see them in the store.
Don't step in the horse manure.
What were they hiding from?
I got an award once. From the Mayor.
And Cole, next time I won't be late for you.
We were supposed to draw a picture. Anything we wanted... I drew a man. He got hurt in the neck by another man with a screwdriver.
Private Kinney's wife is really sick -- she has something called a brain anism.
You ever tell her about how it is with Tommy?
That isn't magic.
You just kept the penny in that hand the whole time...
When they get mad, it gets cold.
Can I ask you then?
What do you want more than anything?
I'm going to transfer you. I know two psychologists that are exceptional--
You weren't a paper champion.
What if they don't want help? What if they're just angry and they want to hurt somebody?
I think we said everything we needed to say.  Maybe it's time to say things to someone else? Someone close to you?
What are you thinking, Momma?
It was Grandma's. It's not for playing.  What if it broke? You know how sad I'd be.
I'd give anything to have been there.
A lady. She died.
Dead people?
She wanted me to tell you--
Excuse me?
I work at an insurance place and at Penny's, so Cole can go to that good school.
Maybe you don't want to remember.
You ever hear of... the harvest of blood?
Yo. "Billy Bob". Was I two beats behind, or what?
Okay, Farm Boy. Joke's over. You've been playin' me from jump street. Where's my Nikes?
Fuck you.
I happen to be a professional.
Hi.
Suzie???
Looks like the alternator.
Dammit, Carl!!!!
Carl, what are you doing?
AAAAAAAAAAAA --
You're not going to arrest me for it, are you?
Sounds familiar.
Nike specials. Two hundred bucks.
Curt Cobain.
The ancient Aztecs knew how powerful this stuff was.
So... what does it do?
Carl! Oh Carrrrl!
Joseph Macdonald... Your son.
Was. You ain't afraid of ghosts, now are you?
Sure. What do you want to know.
Think boy. That night. The night of the fire. At the barn. You were only six years old.
-- And keep your eyes on the road.
Is that all you ever think of? Suppose I was really hurt!
Jesus. What a bunch of useless zombies.
Asphyxiation. Choked to death on a ham sandwich. Next.
Shit!
Is that right?
Name something.
So?
I'm talking to the spirit of Jethro Macdonald. Is it okay to have sex in your old attic with your grandson? We'll be careful of the bed --
We're almost ready. What the hell are you doing out here?
Getting ready.
The trap door. That's how he escaped the fire...
Hold it, hold it. Aren't you forgetting something, Rod?
-- Where have you two been?
Carl.
Shit.
Pretty, ain't they?
Grant, where'd you go?
Wait! Dammit, Bill, if that girl's still out there, how will you find her? How, unless you bring Grant in alive? Your best chance of doing that is with me. I can talk to him --
My father, he was -- he was real close to evil. People didn't know. Still don't. From the time I was a toddler he'd beat the hell out of me. I don't mean just like a smack for smart--mouthing... he took a real enjoyment in it. And when I turned eleven or twelve, things... well, they got worse. Starla looks at Bill, who seems struck.
He's gotta be in the forest. All three ranches run alongside it.
And then we get here, the Castavets', where last night's shit--storm took place.
Surprised you're able to lift a mug after carrying that torch for so long.
I think we best get you to a hospital right quick.
Oh, shit! I hope she ain't a police radio aficionado. If so, I apolog
Megan Halesy' little sister.
Who's the lucky fella?
You're lookin' awful pretty.
Grant? Grant, I'm hungry. I'm so fuckin' hungry I think I'm gonna die.
Sure thing, killer.
Thinkin' 'bout getting me a couple of these big ol' rib eyes.
Flip.
Yeahhhh. I'm sorry. I just got so excited about... your present.
You're my princess, aren't you?
Who's that?
Grant. Oh my God. What happened to your -- ?
When one sees you they all see you.
So he drags the cow backwards here. Only he prolly didn't know 'bout the Castavets had them dogs.
Get your hands off my daughter!
I can't believe there's two thousand people here to watch a bunch of guys back up their trucks.
Okay. I was in Texas dancing in an industrial show for Sunkist Oranges. They say I'm the new Anita Bryant. But I'm really a dancer from New York. A lot of credits. Moderate talent.  Anyway, after opening night, I was walking back to the motor lodge and suddenly there he was. A tall Texan with a twenty-nine inch waist. Pure dynamite.
Why're you driving so fast?
Who'd want to?
An existentialist.
You have a great profile.
Seriously?!?
Anything?
You know, you're not a bad driver.
Christ, what channel are we on?...
Look, the truth is, I didn't want to be dumped at the truck stop. I wanted to go on with you. I needed an excuse.
Let's hit it.
-- Trucking ain't the easiest life in the world. I mean, you can't make it much past fifty and you sure as shit don't get a gold watch when you hang it all up. But I like keeping on the move. You know?
I'm sure the Arkansas Bears put out an all-points.
I been thinking. Maybe I should drop you in Montgomery. I mean, the way things are going, it might get pretty hairy by the time we get to Atlanta.
-- Actually, my heaviest relationship was with a rock singer named Ramblin' Bobby Holt. When I turned twenty- one, I went to Europe with visions of being free and independent. My luck, he was on the plane. I landed in Paris and fell in love before I could claim my baggage.  We were together for almost a year. I thought he was it.
He's just exhausted.
What are you thinking?
I'm begging.
But you'll do it?
I owe you a big one, Hot Pants.
What's your pleasure?
Whadda we have to do -- kidnap the Pope?
How long's this gonna take?
What are you doin' now?
Liquid gold.
Let's get the hell outta here.
Bandit I, do you copy?
Thirty-eight minutes ahead of schedule.
-- Gimme a twenty, pardner.
Ran into a little hassle at the eatum- up-stop.
-- How we doing?
Bandit, I just thought I'd lay a Smokey report on you.
Thanks for the break. Bandit, this here's the Dixie Chicken.
It ain't ever been done before, hot shit.
Gimme three sloppy joes and a coupla cups of hot stuff.
Listen, pardner; this ain't no time to be getting laid.
I'm Kate. You must be Cledus.
But if it can't be done, how's he gonna do it?
That crazy sumbitch made it.
-- Thanks much. I'd like to get me a Smokey report?
-- Did ya hear they nailed the Bandit?
It's gotta be tough keeping an eye on everything.
So he has no idea what's about to happen?
Did he give you his name?
-- run both those names through the D.C. database. Call San Francisco, see if they've got anybody in the field doing collateral inquiries for --
...I forgive you Darwin.
-- Forget about the tissue damage you're doing to the heart itself. Sustained cocaine abuse will segue you from a very painful ventricular fibrillation into full cardiac arrest.  Buddy, nobody knows about your condition, or your drug use. Why you lied to me, knowing that I'd find out anyway, I'll never know, but it imperative now that I see you.
His law firm, same one that hired me. Israel walked out after he made bail and nobody's seen him since.
No, what did you say on the machine?
I dunno... Cinnamon roll?
I am. Yeah.
That's probably him now...
Y'ain't never had to wash another man's blood off, dig it out y'fingernails... Y'had us for that. Y'ain't ever made a real beef on y'own, shit as light in the ass as you are, I'll bet you ain't ever made anything more than a fuck'n fist your whole life.  So if you think I'mma let your lil' punk-ass, with the dirt I've done for you, in the eleventh hour, sell me off like some fucking field nigger, hand me up to the Feds like y'last chip, then you done gone straight out-your-motherfucking MIND!
Baby, I've been co-habitating with these people for the past thirty odd hours and in so doing, have stared into the face of hell. These are the premier prick cocksuckers of all time and I feel beaten by them, I feel bloodied --
My debrief --
...A paternity suit, filed 1967...
...holy shit... that's Heller...  Isn't it?
I'll overlook what you've done here today in light of what's taken place. You've been fully debriefed. Now I want you to return to D.C. immediately and make no further inquiry into this matter. I mean it. It's closed.
You got clicks, anything?
Alright, now Buzzy -- this is, this is it, here, okay, so listen to me careful and wait till I'm finished 'cuz we got no room for slop.
-- yeah, now lemme finish, I was eavesdroppin', so give me sec, lay this thing out, since the information might be a little loose --
For real?
When them tricks hit the lobby, holla at me and I'm gonna meet them on the way up, blend in. Once I get inside, I'mma put m'Nina to Israel's head and back out hot. Anybody's fucks with that program, y'break 'em off. They get gully --
You got the fifty up? Bitch y'tryin' t'take down a jumbo jet? Blown the moon out the sky? T'fuck you wanna get that grimy?
...So you heard from Keith? He still fuckin' with that 'lil light-skinned girl?
Are you anywhere near the penthouse?
They musta been beefin' big time with one another, cuz this shit, got way past words, whatever it was.
What else did Padiche say?
You think you're dreaming me, like you dream her.  Understand something: I am the real Gibarian.  Just a new incarnation.
No?  Who am I, then?
Meaning Man can do whatever the fuck it wants?
You fucking bastard...
It's changing characteristics.  It's solidifying taking on weight.
Tell me.  I won't think you're insane.
I'm not sure.  It started with Gibarian.  He locked himself in his room and refused to talk except through a crack in the door.  He covered the video lens. Obviously we thought he was having a nervous breakdown.  I don't know why he didn't tell us he had somebody in there.  By this time, we were getting visitors, too.  He was desperately trying to figure it out.  Day and night.  Who was she?
It started about three months ago. Right after the government sold the expedition.  We were ready to go home.
Can you meet me and Sartorius on B deck in an hour?
You're unnerved because you've spent your whole life thinking nobody is looking over you, and suddenly your subconscious is an open book.  We are, for the first time, experiencing changes in natural reality by a force not our own.  That proves that --
Well, I think we're reaching the point of diminishing returns here, right?  Certainly it's learning more about us than we'll ever learn about it.
Why do you think she hasn't suggested that?  It's the most obvious solution: Escape.  She knows she can't leave here --
Kelvin, she'll disintegrate.  You don't believe me?  Let's radio that shuttle pod you launched -- better yet, let's go get it.  I've charted it's trajectory, only take a few hours...
I need to see Snow.
I don't know.  I can't be alone.
"And Death Shall Have No Dominion".
Is it intelligent?
Where've you been?
Thinking what you were doing and saying, just being consumed by thinking of you.  I loved it so much, that feeling.
I like that too.
What's wrong.
What's happening to us?
I'm not Rheya.  You've always known that.
Chris, please.  Chris, I'm serious. I won't make it.
What do I have to do to stop it?
You're lying.
That's impossible.  I'm not Rheya.
Is that really what you want?
He won't do it.
Gibarian was under enormous --
I got rid of him.  I wanted to see if... I wanted to be the only one. I wanted to be Snow.
You want it coming back with us?
Uh...
I'm supposed to call in.
You live in Manhattan?
Would you pick one out, please?
I'm sorry about what happened.
I guess I'm supposed to do it in the morning.  Identify him.
No dog.
No dog.
You told me I'm safe?  I'm going for a walk in the park.
Are you okay?
When can I see you?
You still going away?
Well, of course, we'd be... honored...
We're not going to the game, are we Mom?
Tommy...!
Tomorrow, I start looking for our house... You love me?
So how'd it go?
For how long?
I'd identify him.
What did she say the down payment was?
I know you're her bodyguard.  Did she buy it or did you?
Mike, take it easy...
Jesus, Mike, somebody's been feeding you a line of crap.
What did you do tonight?
What did you watch?
I'm going to visit my sister for a few days.  I'd like you to get your stuff out.
Was it Venza?  Did you get him?
Ellie...
I don't know how you did it, but whatever it was, keep doing it.
What about when she identifies him?!
Who's Joey Venza?
Shit!  A Nursemaid!  My first detail, and I'm a fuckin' slug!  I got a 'choice' at all.
You in this with me?
Not Koontz.
... Hard?
You should'a brought the girl.
Why should she come in?
Under the table.
How do you know where the gun is?
Nice threads Dad.
She's what?
You coming in?
Shooting.
Tommy!  The guy's a sleaze-bag.  She can't sing.
Sexual tension...
Time to get my bowling ball re drilled.
When you won that scholarship, I was proud of you.
Yeah, take pity on the feeble minded.
Hey, guys.  Check it out-- I saw this dud on the tube last night. He is incredibly cool.
Mistake?  Hey, guy, get back here!
You maniac.  You'll blow your scholarship.
"Harry Osborne diminishes the stature of the University."
Great idea.  Let me get some shoes. I'll take you home.
You're so responsible it's disgusting. But you're my only friend... do you hate me?
Jesus Christ.
No! Washington Square, manhole covers turn into flying saucers and radios explode like A-bombs.  Did you get pictures?
Would you cool it already?
Is that bug juice, or are you just glad to see me?
Are you quite finished?
Maybe I was hiding.  For years, I never told Ben the one important thing.
It's never too early to be clever. Describe in a sentence how you feel about me.
God, Flash can be such a jerk.
Some prep school thing.
Eat alone, gotta read. Social defense tactic 17  Peter, that jacket is foul.  Lose your glasses?
Sit down and stop being such a child.
This from a man who winces at the cost of a pretzel?
Peter?
You were the last one to see Thorkel.  In Octavius' hospital room.
Roz? Rosomoff?  What is it?
Oh, not that.  You promised you'd burn it.
Ha.  Anti-gravitational particles.
You've used up your grant. The electric bills alone exceed your annual salary.  Not to mention the potential hazards of your radioactive fuel.
Your dog ate it.
Need any more help?
The paper, my boy.  A solid B-plus.
Hello, uh, Mr. Reiss?  I'm-- I'm the guy who wrestled Hulk Hogan the other day.  The guy in the mask?
No?
So they're airing this tonight?
He'll try to finish his experiment.
I listened to him talk of eternal truth and thought of the Bhagavad Gita, the Indian holy book-- "I am become Shiva, Death-- the destroyer of worlds."  Octavius was...
Do you... live around here?
Don't let him kid you. Cagney couldn't have pulled a sweeter job.  All right, boys. We were waiting in the depot in Frankfurt, see? And there was an ammunition train coming through, the longest ammunition train you ever saw, see? So Dunbar gets himself in the men's room, see? Fixes himself a time bomb, busts open the window and just as the train moves out, lays the thing in there, see? So then, he comes out like nothing's happened and three minutes later you can hear it -- boom! Broke every window in Frankfurt. It was gorgeous!
Jawohl.
We made a deal with Barrack One.
What's the match gag?
Come on!
Three's a crowd, especially if you've got to cut your way through barbed wire.  Here's the wire cutters.  Are the civilian clothes ready?
Static is right! The radio's static, Patton's static, we're static!
Just what makes you and them Krauts so buddy-buddy?
I grease the Kraut guards. With ten percent of the take.
Yeah, what about it?  Cut the horsing around. We know he's the stoolie and we know what the pay- off is. Let's get on with it.
You make my mouth water.
Brother, were we all wet about you!
Cut out the guff, Schulz. We're on to you. You know everything that's happening in this barrack. Who's tipping you off?
You'd better get that blue blood circulating, because we're busting out of this stink-hole in exactly --  -- one minute and twenty seconds.
What some brandy?
You won't get off that cheap.
You have no idea how boring my life here is. If it weren't for an occasional air raid or some foolish prisoners trying to escape, I wouldn't know what to do. I want to thank you for keeping me company. I don't drink, I don't smoke, I don't read. I hate music. That only leaves good conversation. It will be a shame to lose you.
As for the blankets, you will notice they are very warm. Fifty percent wool.
Very well. If you insist on details. I have ways of finding out about that blasted time bomb. Good day, sir.  You will forgive me for receiving you like this?
Why don't we accept, Animal? The worst that can happen is we wind up a couple of lamp shades.
What is this? This is water?
Coffee? Milk? Or how about a little cocoa?
I'll kill you, Harry -- so help me!
You can say that again!
Hey -- Russki -- Russki! Look at those bublichkis! Over here!
No you don't! You don't want any broads with boots on!
You want Betty Grable!
How? We go to California. I got a cousin that's working for the Los Angeles Gas Company. That's how we get the address, see? Isn't that clever? I take you up to her house and ring the doorbell and say, 'Congratulations, Miss Grable. We have voted you the girl we'd most like to be behind barbed wire with, and I'm here to present the award'.
If she don't want you, she don't get anything.
No, Animal.
What do those broads say?
Grable, not Gable!
You're crying, Animal.
You don't want to cry over a dame that doesn't even know you're alive! Snap out of it!
May I have this dance, Miss?
Let me do it, Hoffy.
Good evening, Sergeants.  A bit dank in here, isn't it?... Where is the Baracken-Fuehrer?
Wait a minute. We have some rights here.  Why is this man being taken out?
You're wasting your time, Duke.  Outside, everybody! Let's get it over with.
You must get out. For your own good, you must get out.
Lay off, Sefton.
How do they know?
Who did?
You taking Dunbar?
You could use a new one yourself.
Shapiro. Shapiro.
So was the radio private property. So was Manfredi and Johnson.
I thought that's what you said. You're from Cleveland. And you were with the Thirty-sixth Bomb Group?
Three hundred and sixty-fifth Bomb Squadron? Out of Chelveston?
Stop that, will you!  Those idiots! So they sprang Dunbar! So what good is it? He's still in the compound, isn't he? How long can he last? Where can they hide him?
No. I don't sprechen sie deutsch.
We have no radio.
This is me in Cincinnati.
Gentlemen, tomorrow morning the Geneva Man is coming to inspect the camp whether we are living up to the International Convention. I am sure he will find we are treating you very well. You must not run around in your underwear. And take off the wash. The Kommandant wants all the barracks to be spic and also span.
The Captain would make a much more valuable hostage.
It's working.
Actually, Captain, your precise target area was thirty-five meters that way.
According to our information, the ribbon is a conflux of temporal energy which travels through our galaxy every 39.1 years
Data, are you all right?
Fear is a very difficult emotion to overcome. It's something we all have to learn to deal with.
This is its current position.
Now, you said the gravitational forces in this sector have been altered, could that also affect the course of the ribbon?
He can't go to the ribbon, so he's trying to make the ribbon come to him.  Data, is it going to pass near any M-Class planets?
Population?
Approximately forty-seven minutes, sir.
I don't see a control panel, or an access port.
That's it, Bridge- we're all out!
I have rerouted auxiliary power to the lateral thrusters- attempting to level our descent.
You did it, Kirk!  Damage report, Ensign.
Guinan, what's going on? Where am I?
But I never had a wife, children, a home like this.
Soran?
Guinan, can I leave the Nexus?
Can I?
You're right. I'll need help.  Guinan, will you come back with me? Together, we could-
I'm Captain John Harriman. I'd like to welcome you all aboard.
Beautiful day, isn't it?
This clock, I gave this clock to Bones.
So you're telling me this is the 24th-century, and I'm dead?
I take it the odds are against us and the situation is grim?
Oh
You know, Scotty, it amazes me.
An anti-matter discharge directly ahead=8A it might disrupt the field long enough for us to break away.
Aye.
I don't want a science lecture. You were on that observatory looking for trilithium. Why?
We learn something new about ourselves every day.  Now. Maybe I didn't make myself clear. It is very important that you tell me exactly what Captain Picard knows.
There is something else, Captain. One of the scientists, a Doctor Soran,has insisted on speaking with you.  I told him you were busy, sir, but he said it was absolutely imperative that he speak with you right away.
Sir, is there anything wrong?
Maybe they're not out there.
I always thought I'd have a crack at this chair one day.
Well, with all due respect to your Betazoid senses, I prefer to be alone right now.
Captain, Im sorry.  I know there were a lot of unresolved conflicts between you and your brother.
It's only natural to feel a heightened sense of tragedy when a child dies.  But it goes deeper than that, doesn't it? I can sense that Rene meant a great deal to you.
You felt it was no longer your responsibility to carry on the family line.
Or perhaps they're on the surface.
You must think I'm quite the madman.
We're all mortal, Soran. It's one of the truths of ou existence.
An experimental compound the Romulans have been working on. In theory, a trilithium-based explosive would be thousands of times more powerful than an anti-matter weapon. But they never found a way to stabilize it.
They have found a way to penetrate our shields.
Enterprise maintaining full impulse power...
Mr. Chekov, I ordered Spock's quarters sealed!
Excelsior closing to 4,000 meters, sir.
For an instant... A scout class vessel.
Could it be Spock's?
All right -- get your gear. I'll put you down next time around.
It's snow. Snow in the same sector. Fantastic!
All the varieties of land and weather known to Earth within a few hours walk!
Same sector. Metallic mass.
Negative, on surface... A manufactured object.
Later. Let's go...
Saavik... My god, what happened to them?
It's time for total truth between us.  This planet is not what you intended, or hoped for, is it?
I don't understand.
Grissom to landing party. We have you approaching radioactive indications. Do you concur?
Ah, Saavik, that's, ah, extroadinary. What would you, ah, like to do next?
Good shooting, Scotty.
What happened...?
The Genesis planet is gone.
Or less. What you describe is called Fal Tor Pan - the refusion. It is very dangerous. The elders may not choose to attempt it.
My God...
The word, sir?
Warp Speed, Mr. Sulu...
We are secured from Warp Speed... Now entering Genesis Sector of Mutara Quadrant.
Sir, planet core readings unstable... Changing rapidly...
Close... There --
Welcome aboard, Admiral.
Where's Doctor McCoy?
But, we had requested -- we were hoping to take her back to Genesis...
Out of the question! The Council has ordered that no one but the science team goes to Genesis!
David?... David!
Then you know how bravely your son met his death.
He asked you not to grieve...
I have been... and always shall be... your friend. Live long... and prosper!
Forgive me. It is not here. I assumed he had mind-melded with you. It is the Vulcan way when the body's end is near.
Bones!...
What must I do?
What about Spock?
1,000 Kellicams, closing!
500 Kellicams!
My Lord... what are your orders?
The <u>closet</u>?! Have you lost all sense of reality?
It's new -- have you any idea what you're saying?
Not anymore! Now you can do both at the same time! According to myth, the earth was created in six days. Watch out: here comes Genesis; we'll do it for you in six minutes --
Are you out of your Vulcan mind? No human can tolerate the radiation loose in there!
You're not going in there -- !
Cheers. Bones, these are... charming.
Bull. You're hiding -- hiding behind the rules and regulations --
What about the rest of the inspection, Admiral?
It never rains but when it pours --
Khan could be down there!
Go? <u>Where</u> are we going?
Now that's what I call a meal.
Lieutenant, you are looking at the only Starfleet cadet who ever beat the no-win scenario --
Dr. Marcus... good. We're en route to you and should be there in three days.
Come on, Mother, that's just the military mentality. Never put off tomorrow what you can put off today. If there's one atom of life...
Does that about do it?
I've tried to warn you. Scientists are always pawns of the military --
But the child --
He left us.  We were no longer of use. SAAVIK Where is  the Reliant crew? Dead?
Khan, listen to me! Captain Kirk was only doing his duty! You --
I would think so, sir. He's on the Fleet General Staff.
I suppose I was.  I poured a drink. Would you like it?
Let go -- he can't -- !
Steady on course. All systems normal.
They're requesting visual communications, sir.
Well?
We'll lose them if they go in there.
Khan, how do I know you'll keep your word?
You are in a position to demand nothing, sir. I, on the other hand, am in a position to grant nothing. What you see is all that remains of the ship's company and the crew of the <u>Botany Bay</u>, marooned here fifteen years ago by Captain James T. Kirk.
An emergency situation has arisen. By order of Starfleet Command, as of now, 1800 hours, I am assuming command of this vessel. Duty officer so note in the ship's log. Plot a new course: for Space Laboratory Regula I.  Mr. Scott?
We don't have minutes. Can you give me phaser power?
Just barely, sir.
I'll need ten minutes, sir, 'til the radiation dissipates.
Enterprise to Reliant. Come in, Reliant.
On screen.
Enterprise to Reliant: you are ordered to surrender your vessel. Respond!  Nothing, sir.
Midshipman, you're a tiger.
Is the word given?
There's a first time for everything, Admiral.
I would not presume to debate you.
There are two possibilities, sir they are unwilling to respond, they are unable to respond.
What's she doing here?
Not enough against their shields.
Let's hope he hasn't changed the combination. He's quite intelligent...
A distinct possibility.
That's it?
Uh oh.
In my quarters, Uhura.
Any suggestions, Admiral?
I failed to resolve the situation.
This is damned peculiar.  Yellow alert.
Khan!
Indeterminate life signs.
Admiral?
Hold your course. Look sharp...
Mr. Sulu, lock phasers on target and await my command...
Shields activated!
Lieutenant, how many times have you piloted a Starship out of Spacedock?
Sir, may I quote General Order 12: 'On the approach of any vessel, when communications have not been est --
Certainly...
I would accept that as an axiom.
How're you doing?
I know. I feel the same thing. But we're between a rock and a hard place. We can't keep them without risking their lives and we can't let them go without a taking the same chance.
And finally, they're not human beings, you know. Their intelligence has in no way been proven comparable to ours --
Sorry if I spoke out of turn.
You sure this is such a bright idea?
Bones, stay here.
That's crazy!
It doesn't look all that different.
Umm. Well, just wanted to say -- nice to have your katra back in your head, not mine.  I mean, I may have carried your soul, but I sure couldn't fill your shoes.
A simple evacuation of the expanding epidural hematoma will relieve the pressure.
... It gives me a great sense of history.
All right, Commander, you wanna tell us anything?
Go ahead. Stun me.
Operational, Admiral. Cloaking Device now available in all modes of flight.
We are in an enemy wessel, sir. I didn't wish to be shot down on thee way to our own funeral.
Status report, Admiral!
You sure you won't change your mind?
Despite all the things they are teaching us we have to return George and Gracie to the open sea.
Well, for one thing, we simply don't have the money to keep feeding them a couple of tons of shrimp a day!
He's harmless.  Back in the sixties he was part of the Free Speech movement at Berkeley. I think he did too much LDS.
Can I ask <u>you</u> something?
No, ma'am. No dipshit.
Do you trust me?
So how did a nice girl like you get to be a cetacean biologist?
How will that be done, exactly?
Thanks. Cheers.
What's that?
Well, I was close. I knew outer space was going to come into it sooner or later.
Sorry, that's classified.  I don't really have a clue who you are... You wouldn't want to show me around your space ship, would you?
We'll bring them up just like we brought you. It's called a transporter beam...
... Gone?!
Hey! -- Where you going?!
It would be improper to refer to you as Jim while you are in command, Admiral... Also, I must apologize for my attire.  I seem to have misplaced my uniform.
Where are you going?!
Spock...?
There is a 20th Century possibility.
Your use of language has altered since our arrival. It is currently laced with -- shall I say -- more colorful metaphors: "Double dumb ass on you" -- and so forth...
Come on, fellah -- speak up!
Spock...
Status?
Damn.... Damnit! We've been so lucky. We have the two perfect whales in our hands, but if we don't move quickly, we'll lose them!
Mr. Spock, where the hell is the power you promised me?
Aye, sir. Descending.
Three-one-zero, aye!
I have no control, sir!
What is it?
Individual whale song getting stronger... This is strange, Admiral. The song is directly ahead. It's coming from San Francisco.
I'll have bearing and distance for you, sir.
Admiral, I have a signal closing on the whales. Bearing 328 degrees.
Unidentified aircraft, 40,000 feet MSL, range 30 miles, bearing 010.
You'll work it out, Scotty. And remember: two of them.
They're giving out. De-crystallizing.
I'm ready Spock. Let's go find George and Gracie...
Admiral! There be whales here!
Full power, sir.
The explosive override -- ?
Admiral, I'd like to continue my work on the ship until you leave.
Your vessel did destroy U.S.S. Grissom. Your men did kill Kirk's son. Do you deny these events?
Ah, what else indeed? Let me put it another way: how thick would a piece of your plexiglass need to be at 60 feet by 10 feet to withstand the pressure of 18,000 cubic feet of water?
Transparent aluminum?
Hi.
Right on. You fly?
Yes, of course... Do you have any message for your mother?
My people have a strict policy of non-interference with other cultures. In fact, it's our Prime Directive.
You have warp capability?
I don't like to leave questions unanswered.
Deceive us?
There are days.
In defense of offlanders, there are many more like me...
Seeing my home planet from space for the first time...
I wish I could spare a few centuries to learn.
There's one thing I don't understand.  In three hundred years...you never learned to swim?
How is it a woman like you never married? And don't tell me you "just haven't gotten around to it yet"...
There's a cavern at the base of the next hill...
Do machines ever play?
I have to go home now.
You either need a new uniform or a new neck.
Very funny...
She's stabilizing.
Yes... that looks like them.
Incomplete, I might add.
... it is conceivable I was shot to protect the secret of its existence.
We're taking this ship out of here... this mission is over...
The Enterprise can be at your position in two days, Admiral...
What kind of concerns?
All right. You have twelve hours, Captain. Then I want you out of The Briar Patch. In the meantime, we'll be heading out to the perimeter to call for Son'a reinforcements in case you fail.
That's why we put chromodynamic shields in place - so our people wouldn't feel the effects from the metaphasic radiation...
The Prime Directive doesn't apply. These people are not indigenous to this world. They were never meant to be immortal. We'll simply be restoring their natural evolution.
On Earth, petroleum once turned petty thugs into world leaders. Warp drive transformed a bunch of Romulan thugs into an empire. We can handle the Son'a, I'm not worried about that...
Order them to surrender, and I promise you won't be court- martialed.
I wonder... which one of us will be facing that court-martial...
What you're asking me to do... is impossible... the crew is loyal to Ru'afo...
Gallatin! So the righteous Starfleet Captain finally released you. Did you encounter any problems on the surface?
They're following the kelbonite deposits... using the interference to block our transporters...
Moving them is one thing. Killing them all...
His ethical and moral subroutines took over all of his basic functions...
Full impulse.
If we don't outrun them, the manifolds are going to be the only thing left of this ship.
Commander, I'm showing two Son'a ships on an intercept course.
What's inside that nebula cluster?
We're still thirty-six minutes from transmission range, sir.
Come out, come out wherever you are...
He's activated a transport inhibitor.
Do you know Gilbert and Sullivan?
Debrief them again.  Have you been in a fight, Commander?
You need a haircut, Commander.
All injector sub-systems are confirmed off-line.
One. It's Ru'afo.
... Population three hundred million...
Wine, women and song.
You haven't done that in a long time...
What you're doing to my neck...
It says here that some form of genetic damage has apparently prevented the Son'a from procreating...
This isn't one of the usual therapeutic postures...
Why don't you try sitting up?
But he's been dead for three hundred...  Oh God... we've gone back in time again, haven't we?
It's Cochrane.
What are we waiting for? Let's go.
There must be some good people... even in this time.
You think they're still up there?
His automatic reflexes are fluctuating. We've got to get him on a respirator.
The occipital fracture is widening... we're going to have to fuse the bones...
Do you know what this is, Data?
No. I will not betray my friends.
Have you ever know a woman? Do you know what it's like to feel her breath on your face... her skin against yours... flesh against flesh?
I am... grateful for what you have given me. But I still do not wish to be assimilated.
Yes...
Can you configure it?
We are approaching the Terran System, Captain.
I have helm control.
That is a contradiction. The Borg act as a collective consciousness. There are no individuals.
The planet's surface is covered with Borg technology.  So is the moon... and three other planets in this solar system.
Where's the battery room for the hospital?
This must be it.
Picard to Enterprise.  Enterprise, please respond.
Maybe...  Sure. Yeah. As long as I could get a clear look at the intake configuration. But so far, we haven't found any other photos.
No... the door's too thick.
Ready to deploy the warp nacelles.
There's no temporal shielding in here! We're starting to pick up relativistic effects!
Captain, the Enterprise!
Their com system must still be down.
What about our warp signature? It has to be strong enough for them to detect.
Yes.
Where in the States?
Beautiful city. Used to be, anyway. I didn't think anyone still lived there.
Take care of him. He's a very special man.
What makes you say that?
You're leaving, aren't you?
Captain, I've found the Borg Sphere. It's on the far side of the planet...firing at the surface.
They must've done it in the past... they went back and changed history...
I have assigned two damage control teams to locate the source of our communication problems. So far, they've had no success.
They're connecting the conduits to subspace communications...
Report!
Emergency override!
I remember it made me sick.
Worf? Is something wrong?
What the hell happened down there, Worf?
Are we in any danger of being detected by Earth defense systems?
Even Data?
I'd prefer not to be the President to push the button if I can avoid it.
Good luck, Captain.
I'm going to perform surgery on a torpedo - you never know...
Thanks...
That was the general idea I intended to convey.
Are we playing multiple choice?
What is it with you, anyway?
It's the viridium patch Spock slapped on my back right before we went aboard Gorkon's ship.
ARE YOU CRAZY?
Perhaps with a few small steps at a time. Like this one.
I was nervous -
What are you in for, if you don't mind me asking?
I've always wanted to meet you, Captain.
My God, what happened here?
WHAT HAPPENED?
Under article 184 of Interstellar Law, I place you both under arrest. You are charged with assassinating the Chancellor of the High Council.
What?
Did you have occasion to refer to your ship's data banks during that night?
You were demoted...
You deny that your men beamed aboard KRONOS One and shot the Chancellor?
As Captain I am responsible for the conduct of the crew under my command.
Just the size of my head -
Torpedo room--?
Get close enough to a man and you can kill him on "Stun" without setting off the alarm - of course you can't get rid of the body...
She's here - somewhere.
Klingon blood.
Now we expand our search to include uniforms.
An INCIDENT?
Thank you, Captain.
We don't get many presidential assassins.
I know how to get outside the shield.
Stand down your weapons.
Sorry -
Who is "US?"
Just the prototype.
How could you vouch for me? That's...  ... arrogant presumption -
What the -
I am responsible for involving you in this. I will go.
I've been dead before. Uhura, raise Excelsior. She ought to have the co-ordinates.
Are you dining on worms?
Control tower, reading, Sir.
You must have faith.
But we can't allow them to be taken back to Kronos as prisoners.
Very well. For twenty-four hours we'll agree that this conversation did not take place.
Any progress?
A lie?
In nineteenth century France, workers who felt their livelihood threatened by machines, flung their wooden shoes - called SABOTS - into the gears to stop them. Hence the word SABOTAGE.
Sorry to wake you, sir, but Starfleet urgently requests any data we may have on the whereabouts of Enterprise.
Sir?
According to this we've completed our exploration of the entire sector.
I have confirmed the location, sir, but...
They're outside the beaming shield. Mr. Scott, start your engines.
An ancestor of mine maintained that if you eliminate the impossible whatever remains - however improbable - must be the truth.
Under impulse power she expends fuel like any other ship. We call it "Plasma" - I do not know the Klingon name for it, but by any name it is merely ionized gas.
Do you know where you are?
Brother. I cannot move.
Do you know anything about Shinzon's plans against the Federation?
When was he... created?
So... To happy endings.
And you were particularly aware of this feeling because Commander Riker will be leaving to assume command of the Titan?
The choices I made have led me here as well. This is the only home I have ever known. I cannot foresee a reason for leaving.
If I were... I believe my memory engrams would sense the absence of your specific reactions and behavior. I would "miss you."
The closest signature is two kilometers to the west... that direction, sir.
He is very observant.
Yes, sir.
"For now we see but through a glass darkly..." He said he's a mirror.
You have a red shirt.
Since positronic signatures have only been known to emanate from androids such as myself, it is logical to theorize that there is an android such as myself on Kolarus III.
At present he serves no useful function. Dr. Soong created us to become active and useful members of society. I do not believe he would have wanted the B-9 to live out his life in his present state.
It appears to be...  ... an arm.
No.
Really, Captain, it was a lovely toast.
It's about Data  I've watched him with the B-9 and I'm troubled. Data's desire for a "family" is very strong. I'm afraid he may be investing too much in the B-9.
The B-9 is like a slow child, sir. And Data, in his own way, has assumed the position of a parent or guardian. I'm afraid he has expectations based on his own experiences. He'll be disappointed when the BI-9 cannot meet those expectations.
The one thing he may have forgotten in the course of battle: me.
I'm only half human.
Open a channel.
I read six distinct positronic signatures, spread out over a few kilometers on the surface.
What's he doing?
Admiral Janeway. Good to see you.
 Believe me, we don't under- stand it either. You're the closest ship so I want you to high tail it over there and hear what he has to say. Get the lay of the land, If the Empire becomes unstable, it could mean trouble for the entire quadrant.

Enterprise. We are the Reman Warbird Scimitar.
It would take me but an instant to tear that valiant heart from your chest.
Captain. I think it is inappropriate for a Starfleet officer to appear...  Naked.
I'm picking up an unusual electromagnetic signature from the Kolarin system.
Sir, we've had an unauthorized access into the main computer.
What's this?
Captain, I hope I don't have to remind you --
We have to assume he had Romulan collaborators.
It's working.
She's not out for a pleasure cruise.
Anything.
Serving with you has been an honor.
Praetor?
On the world I come from there's no light. No sun. Beauty isn't important. I see now there's a world elsewhere.
No one knew what to do. Finally I was taken to a doctor who had some experience with Terran illnesses and I was finally diagnosed with Shalaft's syndrome. Do you know of it, Captain?
You know I need to verify this.
A lifetime of violence will do that. My nose was broken four times. And my jaw... But so much is the same. The eyes, you recognize the eyes.
For thousands of years the Romulan Senate has met in this chamber and dictated the fate of its sister-planet... But the time has come for us to live as equals.
And you dreamed about what was up there. About...
Maybe I'll train it to do little tricks for me like your robot does.  Or maybe I'll snap its ugly head off.
It amazes me how little you know yourself.
I have little interest in your quaint vessel, Captain. If the Enterprise will withdraw to a distance of one hundred light years, it will not be harmed.
I know... you'll all gladly die to save your home world.
The man who is Jean Luc Picard and Shinzon of Remus won't exterminate the population of an entire planet! He is better than that!
That's your life... not mine.
My God...
Join us, Commanders.  Now what's the disposition of the fleet?
Then I don't understand the reason for the delay!
And bringing the Enterprise here?! What possible purpose could that serve?
The Enterprise is immaterial! They won't make it back to Federation space.
Commander Suran, the games are over. In two days the Federation will be crippled beyond repair. Does that satisfy you?
Benny, there's nothing there.
Don't you think you should call a backup?
Mike, call for back-up.  Benny, you all right?
Credit card.
Well, here we are... You go down that ramp there, you're sure to get a ride.
Where did you stop last?
What was your last stop?
Recognize this?
I saw it with my own eyes. We've killed an extraterrestrial and...
Not necessarily bad! If they knew we were here why didn't they let us know they were coming?
That's not going to happen, George, unless you get us the help you promised us.
I don't care where you're from you just can't disappear into thin air.
Hello George.
What's all this for?
That's the chance we have to take.
Then you're going to have to do it without me.
I want to speak to Marc Shermin.
Is the man who kidnapped you there now?
Please...
Steering wheel...
Steering wheel... gear shift... dashboard...
Money.
Mi-chi-gan driver li-see-ens... Jennyhaydn... Money?
No gas.
Go.
Who are you?
No gas.
I am husband?
No.
Satisfied? Now get out. Out.
What?
I want to try it.
Sun... day. No sun... night. You understand?
Yes.
The driver will...
Right. In Omaha the driver will put you on the bus for Salt Lake City and the new driver will take...  ...this part. When you get to Salt Lake City, ask the driver, 'Las Vegas, please'...
Don't worry. They're not going to hurt you. Come on.  Only show this to the driver. Nobody else. And don't lose it.
Don't be afraid. Do what I told you and you'll be okay.
Yes. I have a long ride ahead of me...  Goodbye.
You did? That's funny. So did we.
The captain...
Sounds like your captain's going to get hell when he gets back home.
What are you doing?
Do you have music up there?
You liked my singing?
You can have one.
Are you angry at me?
I don't want you to be hurt.
Why can't we wait here for a ride?
Hello... hello. How are you this morning?
This is crazy. We don't have time for this.
It'll tell you pretty much everything about us...
Any words you don't know you can find in the dictionary.
This is yours...
There.
Help me!!!
You sure this is your car?
I told you I'm looking for someone.
I don't know where he is.
The five-fifty. We already passed it. But it'll take him way out of his way.
Good... It looks like we might be the welcoming committee, so I think we should try and figure out what we're gonna do if we have to come face to face with this creature.
You get that, Lyman?
I'm telling you they're probably friendly.
This has always been my favorite time of day.
Any signs of biological contamination, excessive radiation, anything like that?
We had a flight of F16's play tag with the spaceship over Michigan for an hour. Then it shot straight up and disappeared.
You married, Major?
How would you describe the sounds we heard coming out of that thing's helmet?
Nothing up there... The grass is matted down in a few places, but that could have been anything.
I don't understand.
Good job, neither do I. What do you do for a living?
I'm a cook. Do you understand 'cook?'
Come on, let's go, I got to get back.
Okay, let's get you wired up.  I hope this axle grease you got in your hair doesn't screw up the squid receptors.
Easy, Eduardo, easy.  Preserve a sense of humor at all times.  Okay, the receptor rig... what I'm putting on your head... sends a signal to the recorder.  See we call it "being wired," but there's no wire.  You gotta keep the recorder close... five, six feet away max, like in your jacket pocket by the bed or wherever you're going to close escrow, know what I mean?
We have nothing to talk about, Lenny.
Look, Tran... Lenny just came by to give me some bad news.  An old friend of mine has been murdered. You remember Iris?
Well, I'm certainly in the mood for a party.
Believe it.  Now bring me the trodes, baby.  Come on, quick.
You can't just... kill him.
Cut it out, Tran.
Hi, baby.  I've missed you.
You have to go.  I mean it.
You talked to Iris?  When?
He has his uses too.
Yeah, for about a month now.  Lenny, just stay away from Tran, okay?  And stay away from me.  Stop trying to rescue me.  Those days are over. I'm a big girl now.  Stop trying to save me, okay, because I don't need saving... Just... give up on me.
You don't know what you're fucking with here.
How did it happen?  What was Iris doing riding around with Jeriko wearing a wire?
So finally he gives Iris some cash and tells her to check into the hotel under a wrong name till he figures out what to do.
Just what I've read.  That the technology was developed for the Feds, to replace the body wire.  And now it's gone black market.  So, uh, do I get the deck from you?
Come on, amigo, the world's full of marks.  And nobody knows how to work 'em like you do, pal.  You could sell a goddamn rat's asshole for a wedding ring!  Let me buy you a drink.
Bobbyyyy!  Tequila por favor! Double shots.  Make it Tres Generaciones, huh.  Nothin' but the best for my good friend Lenny, the finest cop that ever got thrown off the vice squad.  Hey, nice tie.
I just hate to see you pining away. It makes me want to vomit, frankly.  Broken hearts are for assholes.
You should feel like shit.
And he records it.  Thrill kill. Wants to see it again.  And again.
Top ten.
Hey, the last day of the world and you spend it in bed.
Sounds like Tick's already celebrating.
What stuff?
Mace... no disrespect... but you run this on the 11 o'clock news, by midnight you got the biggest riot in history.  They'll see the fucking smoke from Canada.
He's got her up in the room, under guard.  And he's still working the party... acting smooth like nothin's nothin'.  So buddy... I say we work a trade.
2-2-0-3.  Got it.  Stay on her.
No.  I suppose not.  I didn't know you were colorblind, Max.
I'll have that.  Glock 22.  Nice.
Was I a really busy guy?  Did I do Tick too?
No plan is perfect, Lenny.  Hey, cheer up.  World's gonna end in ten minutes anyway.
Charm.
Nero.
Jeez, you're pathetic.  Okay, I got a pickup at the St. James.  I'll take you there, you can get a cab.
Buncha techno-perv jerkoffs.
Me bailing your sorry pale ass out of jail twice in the last six months.
What's his name?
Are we having a bad night?
I need my case.  It's still in the back.
That would be no.
So am I.  Just trying to get by.
Forget her.
You're some piece of work, you know that.  Just calmly backstroking around in the big toilet bowl, and somehow you never let it touch you. I mean, between Vice and this so- called occupation you're in now, you must've seen it all.
What is it?
Blackjack?  I don't understand--
Jesus, Mace.  Back off.
Uh unh.  No way!  They'd crucify me.
Is this great fabric or what?
No more, Lenny.
No it doesn't.
Will you relax.  There's nobody back there.
Lenny, give them the tape.
Shit!
Tell me.
Hang on.  Hang on, Max.  You see?
So, let's see, I've got Tran's goons, some squidhead psycho and the LAPD all trying to kill me.  Happy new year, Lenny.
There's a plus side?
The only card we have to play is the tape.  You know, we get it to the media somehow...
I guess.
I worked Vice, Narcotics... Violent Crimes... and I saw every known depravity.  I was lost, Mace.  In outer darkness.  Then I busted this strung-out little teeny-hooker. When I met Faith she was just another runaway giving twenty dollar blowjobs to buy crank.  Another lost soul.
That's the original.  There are no copies.
Take it to him.
Are we under arrest?
Where were you Mom?  Did you meet a guy?
Right.  That explains it.
Testa?
Have you had a chance to think about --
Agent Duncan, there's an interstate issue up on 54, run out there.
Excuse me, a salesman gets done in his car and you call the FBI?
I hope that wasn't a joke because I can assure you, from personal experience, the FBI does not have a sense of humor.
Her name is Karen Sumpter, from near Dell City. Just disappeared a couple weeks back. Vanished.
Who knows.
You tell me.
What does the Manager say?
Dylan here.
Hi there.
You have the body?
I want the autopsy report, where is it, Minnesota?
A grill pattern.
You can't imagine how many men have told me that.
What are you...?
You're a... you're sick.
The man who was with him, he was a construction worker?
How did you know he was a construction worker?
Look, sorry. Don't say a word.  I know this is improper. I've been trying to speak with Deputy Director Koessler. I left a message. I must speak with you before you go back to Washington.
I think I talked to him.
You refused to comply with a direct order.
Do you think he singled you out?
I'll take it into consideration.
You feeling okay, Agent Mackelway?
I'm hesitant to...
We had every reason to believe he was on that plane. He was supposed to be on the plane. Everything was incinerated, it was two weeks before we reached the crash site. We, the Director and I, decided it was in everyone's best interest to declare Dick Low dead. That way he could exit a hero.
Both in the last year. I suspected only someone as brilliant as Dick Low could find these guys.  Look, whatever Daitz told you, nobody wanted to strip Richard of his badge. You have to get close to be good at what he did, the trick is not to get too close.
I'm told you've asked for a Bureau cross-check of flight records to and from El Paso, Ft. Myers, Omaha, the Murman murder time frames.
There was talk of a file photo.
We'll wait. Get online with Low, inform him of Zero's route -- we'll set a trap for him.
Hawkins isn't the target, Richard Low's the target.
You used to be in the Behavioral Science Unit, right?
I read your white paper. It's sort of like the Bible for what they're trying to do in Computer Crime.
This is a sexy case.
And who kills in the manner of his victim.
Chat jargon for moving from fantasy to real victims: "I went live last month."
What's that?
He thinks he looks young.
None. Can't find a thing. Nothing on file, nothing online. It's not a part of any known killer's signature.
Why did Koessler assign you as my liaison?
Find the feet?
Jesus.
The tattoo?
Maybe we should back off a bit.
My watch. He toyed with me. He sent me to Chicago.
This feels like something out of a spy novel.
I met with Richard Low.  These are names of missing persons he has flagged. I'm double-checking every case, but I don't want to be too obvious about it. I marked the ones I'd like you to work on.
I need something tangible. To hook him. I told him I'd found the confidential file on the Suspect Zero theory.
You're putting me in a difficult position.
But why this pattern?
Suspect Zero is a crackpot theory. You said so.
I haven't changed anything.  Damn.
Unlock these cuffs.
How did you know Speck was a killer?
This is Richard Low. Stay on the phone. Do not disconnect. I'm watching you. I will instruct you where to drive.
I don't carry it with me.
Hum a tune and I'll sing to it.
It's my master list of missing persons: men, boys, girls, children over the last ten years. Two hundred and eighty-five names. A pool of possible victims.
[Reality very risky.]
Haven't had any, but I'm willing to try.
Leave this room, I'll go back with you, blow your cover.
Thomas Mackelway.
I'm Agent Thomas Mackelway, FBI. There is no way you will escape. Assistant Deputy Director Richard Low is en route with another Agent.  You may know Low by another name. You may know him by the name Murman. I am Lionheart.
Michael, this is Grandma. I want to know if you got the part on that television program. I told the whole family and they're very excited to know if...  Skipping message. End of final message.
You've been through worse.
Ever since I've known you.
You really should. Life, after all, is really just a series of challenges...
Do you realize that I've been waiting for that call for six months and I cut her off?
Well, you know, it's tough. A lot of traveling. A lot of hotels... but, you know, it's a dream... and the money's really good. I think I might buy another really expensive imported car after my next gig in Vegas...
Like the quiche?
Well, I left someone very special behind.
How?
You want to come with us to a party at the Chateau Marmont? They got a bungalow and lots of beautiful babies.
Why don't I just wait three weeks and tell her I was cleaning out my wallet and found her number...
No... no... The worst was when I went in for this After-School special and I'm sitting in the waiting room with all these little kids. I see they're all signed in for the same role as me...
Always...
Well, who represents you back east?
You said there are advantages to being single. I want to know what the advantages are.
I'll have to come see you sometime.
Neither is acting. Not if you're serious about it.  Can I have one of these?
...Which one...?
Hi.
Yeah, uh, I don't think that's gonna be happening any time soon... Listen, can I call you right back? I gotta take this call...
And what if I don't want to give up on her?
So I don't call either way.
Right... Wait, what do you mean?
I mean, I need the money.
There's just something about being "Goofy". Any other Disney character would be fine. There's just this stigma associated with the character.
How many strokes?
It's like, every day I see a beautiful woman. I'm not used to that. I'm used to seeing a beautiful woman, I don't know, once a week. I can't handle it.
What's that guy's name? Sue?
Oh, like that song...
No, I just promised myself I'd give it a try. I gotta get out there sooner or later.
How am I doing well? I host an open mike and I played a fuckin' bus driver in a movie. Big fuckin' deal. I'm with an agency that specializes in fuckin magicians. How good am I doing?
See, it's all how you look at it. If your life sucks, then mine is God awful. I mean, I moved out here partially because I saw how well you were doing. You got in the union, you got an agent. I thought if you could make it, maybe I could too...
How did you get over it? I mean how long 'til it stopped hurting?
By the way, the guys back home said she put on some weight.
Big butt... you know, can't fly coach.
But most important, man, I'm sorry about what I said. I was drunk... My adrenaline was going...
There you two are. I walked around for an hour with that stupid martini on my tray.
That's right.
Excuse me. We're in a bit of a hurry.
Listen to me, baby, there are going to be beautiful babies there.
I can't lose more than a hundred.
Wait.
What are you wearing? I mean, we should wear suits.
Wear a suit, I'm telling you it works.
I took out three hundred, but I'm only gonna bet with one. I figure if we buy a lot of chips, the pit boss will see and they'll comp us all sorts of shit, then we trade back the chips at the end of the night. You gotta be cool though.
This is fuckin' post-pubescent Disneyland.
Don't make fun, I think we can get some free shit if we don't fuck around.
...Well, you know, not counting the first table.
Baby, don't talk like that, baby.
That was so demeaning...
I'm too tired for this. Let's just go.
That's bullshit.
Baby, you did fine.
Wait...  She's crying. I finish. I hold up my finger like "Wait a second". They sit in silence for, like, at least five minutes. I look up and they all start clapping, and now they're all crying. Even the camera guy.
No, man. I need to use the phone.
That was different.
...a day...
No. Doesn't that suck?
Which one?
What are you doing?
Was I money?
She didn't see.
We got the digits, baby.
It's not like that...
I don't know. I guess kids were hitting each other or something.
What a surprise...
Now?
That was pretty cold, dude.
...we're not...
Definitely. Two days. That's the industry standard...
You dick.
It is on.
Beautiful. What time are you off...  ...Christy?
The Don himself is coming to me tonight?
Be my friend.
Understood.  I just wish I was doing more to help out.
You're staying home.  You're not going out.
Paulie's been a little sick all winter...he was home.
I tol' you to stay put, Paulie...
I'll think about it.
You look terrible.  I want you to eat well, to rest.  And spend time with your family.  And then, at the end of the month, this big shot will give you the part you want.
I'm sure it's the most generous gift today.
Two terms; one in Italy, one in the United States.  He's known to the Government as a top narcotics man. That could be a plus for us; he could never get immunity to testify.
No.  Let the people enjoy him.  You see?  He is a good godson.
When does my daughter leave with her bridegroom?
What was this for?
And this?
Have you thought about a wife?  A family?
Yes, but sons who would be professors, scientists, musicians...and grandchildren who could be, who knows, a Governor, a President even, nothing's impossible here in America.
I told you that it wouldn't escape his eye.
...a fine boy from Sicily, captured by the American Army, and sent to New Jersey as a prisoner of war...
Things went badly in Palermo?
Hey America!  Is she as rich as they say?
Who are those girls?
The old man wants you; Johnny's here...he's got a problem.
Tom, you're the Consigliere, what do we do if the old man dies?
What about that Tattaglias?  What will they do about Bruno?
The other families won't sit still for all out war.
Come ON Sonny, your father wouldn't want to hear this.  This is not a personal thing, this is Business.
Pop, they hit us and we hit them back.
We'll let the old man take it easy for a couple of weeks.  I want to get things going good before he gets better.  What's the matter with you?
Will you give this to him.
Sonny was hot for my deal, right? You know it's the smart thing to do, too.  I want you to talk Sonny into it.
Hello Kay.  Your father's inside, doing some business.  He's been asking for you.
Sure.  Anything I can do for you.
What will your father say?
What time do they expect us?
Michael?
Hello.  Kay?
Can you say it?
I can't...
I'm Michael Corleone--this is my father.  What happened to the detectives who were guarding him?
I was worried when we couldn't get in touch with you in that hick town.
How can you be sure?
Is it going to be all-out war, like last time?
Sonny...Sonny--Jesus Christ, I'm down at the hospital.  I came down late.  There's no one here.  None of Tessio's people--no detectives, no one.  The old man is completely unprotected.
Mikey, you look beautiful!
What is it?
I'm not asking you for help, Mike. Just take off the handcuffs.
The chef cooked for you special; the dancers will kick your tongue out and you credit is good!  Draw chips for all these people so they can play on the house.
Buy me out?...
You think I scam?
Tom was telling me about his trip over. Made me laugh so much I got a nosebleed.
Shut up.
I hope it wasn't cheap.
Who's this?
Okay.  And did we know each other?
I'm intruding.
Now? Okay. Wait a minute. Talent --  The only talent my son has is for cashing his allowance.
It's got nothing to do with my mother! She's had leukemia for -- ! This is what makes me boil about him! HE wants me back! -- it's got nothing to do with my mother.
Could we sail to Venice?
I love the fact you brought Shakespeare with you and no clothes. Ermelinda says you wash the same shirt out every night. Is that true?
I didn't mean with you in it.
You've got to get a new jacket. Really. You must be sick of the same clothes. I'm sick of seeing you in them.
Look, Tom, we've got to go to a club and meet some friends of Freddie's. The best thing is -- if you want to be a tourist -- grab a cab and we can meet up at the railway station.
...The thousand dollars, of course, was only due in the event that you succeeded in bringing Dickie home. Naturally, I hope the trip has afforded you some pleasure despite the failure of its main objective you need no longer consider yourself obligated to us in any way...
I'm suddenly quite happy to be going back.
I've got plans!
I thought I might come back. In the New Year. Under my own steam.
You see, particularly with the Marge problem, you can just blame me.
What?
The funny thing -- I'm not pretending to be somebody else and you are. I'm absolutely honest with you. I've told you my feelings. But you, first of all I know there's something -- that evening when we played chess, for instance, it was obvious --
You should watch that!
Most enjoyable. Herbert Greenleaf.
Could you ever conceive of going to Italy, Tom, persuade my son to come home?  I'd pay you. I'd pay you 1000 dollars.
This theory, the letter he left for you, the Police think that's a clear indication he was planning on doing something... to himself.
You don't want to, dear. I'd like to talk to Tom alone -- perhaps this afternoon? Would you mind? Marge, what a man may say to his sweetheart and what he'll admit to another fellow --
Is Mr Greenleaf here?
I could probably see my bedroom from here. I can see my house. When you see where you live from a distance it's like a dream, isn't it?
Dickie, you can't even drive a car! No, what we need urgently is an icebox. What do you think, Tom? Agree with me and I'll be your friend for life.
Are you okay?
The thing with Dickie -- it's like the sun shines on you and it's glorious, then he forgets you and it's very very cold.
How are you? Sorry. Is your book going well?
I was just looking at you --  so quiet.
How long's he staying for?
He hates being confronted.
Did he kill Freddie?
Tell me the truth. Did he kill Freddie?
What?
I was looking forward to seeing him.
Tom?
Dickie? Do you know Dickie?
Is this you?
But you're going skiing with us Yankees, aren't you?
At Christmas. To Cortina with Freddie Miles and --
Everybody knows Freddie Miles.
Now? I don't think so. But I've met him, of course, and we've chatted and I know about you and Marge and Mongi and what an unreliable rat you are. Freddie said you were a rat and I thought to myself now I know why he travels under R.
The truth is if you've had money your entire life, even if you despise it, which we do -- agreed? -- you're only truly comfortable around other people who have it and despise it.
Let's go.
Let's take a Carozza and look at the moon.
Don't worry. Really. Don't worry.
I was looking at you, your clothes, I wouldn't have known you...
What?
Questa lettera e stata trovata nell'abitazione del signor Richard Greenleaf a Roma.
Yes, what happened? I heard you were desperate to come. I was looking forward to rowing you around.
Well hurry, before we sink.  Should I give you my telephone number in Venice?
I know the Piazza di Spagna. What time?
My God.
Anyway I've got to the bottom of the delay. Finally. We're waiting for someone from Rome.
Not guilty.
Are you okay?
Tom, are you okay?
Tom. Tom! Tell me, what's going on?
Plans -- good, plans for tonight or plans for the future?
How was it?
Was that Meredith?
Good things about Tom Ripley? Could take some time!... Tom is talented. Tom is tender... Tom is beautiful...
Senta. We have to ask you to stay in Rome.
So, the Doctor, he has to make the --  -- come se dice?
It's not a pattern, it's a coincidence. There must be fifty hotels in San Remo, there must have been a hundred people renting a boat on that day.
I have!
How much for everything.
That's really something.
Three in the morning? I don't think so. I have to go to bed early. I work days. It must have been somebody else.
You're right! Now I remember! It was after the Western regional planners were in town and the meeting went late. The next day I was completely bushed. It was unbelievable.
The DMZ?
Well, I don't go to the Plaza every night.
What hours do you work?
You mean you work seventy-two hours a week.
You must be rich.
That song by Kris Kristofferson, where it's said "Like a pusher, party truth, partly fiction, a walking contradiction". 
Where are you going?
Well... mostly...
But... Betsy...
What about the record?
I see where Palantine got the nomination.
How are you, Travis? I read about you in the papers.
No, no, please. This fare's on me. Please.
Travis?
First push the man, then the issue. Senator Palantine is first of all a dynamic man, an intelligent, interesting, fascinating man.
No, I didn't forget "sexy".
Just what?
Oh, are you all right?
What is your name? My name is Travis.
No, no, it's alright. I'll have a big Coca-Cola -- without ice -- and a large buttered popcorn, and...  ...some of them chocolate covered malted milk balls... and ju-jukes, a box. They last.
Well, whatever the fuck it is, she used it. And then the spray perfume. You know, the real sweat kind -- and, on top of that, get this, right when we're crossing the Tri-boro bridge -- she changes her pantyhose!
Sure. What do you think? She wanted to get out of the cab. I said "Look, you're in the middle of the fucking bridge..."
Yeah. We went to Harvard together. 
You run all over town, don't you, Travis?
Well, if there's this many hackies inside, there must be lots of fares outside. And I'm gonna hustle 'em.
Where.
Huh?
20 bucks?
We better make it, or Sport'll get mad. How do you want to make it?
Can't you listen to me? Don't you want to get out of here?
Do they drug you?
Listen...
Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it!
Well, I tried.
I'm a Libra too. That's why we get along so well.
Rock music died in 1970, that's what I think. Before that it was fantastic. I can tell you that. Everybody was crashing, hanging out at the Fillmore. Me and my girlfriend Ann used to go up the fire escape, you know? It was unbelievable. Rock Stars everywhere. That Airplane -- that's my group, man. All Libras. But now everybody's split or got sick or busted. I think I'll move to one of those communes in Vermont, you know? That's where all the smart ones went. I stayed here.
You a narc?
What should I do? Call the cops?
You're not much with girls, are you?
Sure you don't want to come with me?
I sure hate to go alone...
Why should it be grounded?
No.
So why do you want to be a taxi driver?
There's porno theatres for that.
Sorry, sir. I didn't mean that.
Twenty-six.
Some. Here and there.
Is that so?
Look, um, if you give me your name and address, we'll send you the information on how to apply.
Sure.
Sure, Henry. I got it all. We'll send you all the stuff all right.
Hey, Sport. How are things?
Get it.
So howsit?
I wanted to ask you something, on account you've been around so long.
Yeah.
Look, a person does a certain thing and that's all there is to it. It becomes what he is. Why fight it? What do you know? How long you been a hack, a couple months? You're like a peg and you get dropped into a slot and you got to squirm and wiggle around a while until you fit in.
You fit in. It's lonely, it's rough at first. But you fit in. You got no choice.
Not really.
Maybe.  Not really.
Thank you.
John Mason.  ' Don't be shocked.  I don't have much time.  Please listen carefully  ....
Motor oil?
God's speed.
This Luke was a pretty good guy, wasn't he?
Dell, I can't write unless I'm happy, and I can't be happy unless I'm here -- and with you.  This is me, Delly.  Pete Appleton. And I love you!
Then why do I feel like we're still being shadowed?
City hall?
You don't have a boyfriend or anyone... you know... like that?
Now, did you remember that, or...
Your dancing's very good.
I see...
Sir, that is true.
Yes... yes, I do.
Well, I'd direct the attention of counsel and committee to line thirty-six of the document, and the name printed and signed there.
Yet you're contradicting yourself. You earlier testified that you attended a meeting of a communist party-run organization, yet you just said, under oath, that you were not now -- nor ever -- a member of the communist party.
The chair notes that you are appearing without the benefit of counsel today, Mr. Appleton.  We certainly hope this means that you intend to be fully forthcoming with this committee?
Only one in town.  Get in, son.
Thanks for the lift, Cecil.
C'mon, I'll give you two a lift back to the Bijou.
Luke, you probably don't remember me, Roscoe Fitts, I'm the grocer here in town.
I can only imagine.  You know, I spoke with your Dad last year about maybe taking the Bijou off his hands.  I don't think he gave it very much thought.
Luke, I'm hopping you can help him see the reality of the situation. I'll come to the point.  I want to buy the property, and I'm prepared to offer six-thousand dollars for it.  And that's just for the property, mind you.  If you want, I'll leave it to you and your father to dismantle and liquidate the building for whatever salvage value it has, and you keep those proceeds.  I just want the land.
Excuse me... what's your, um, your name?
You never came back from the war. We were told you were missing and presumed dead.
Didn't you have any help?
Yes?
Carl.  Friend of yours from high school.  Everybody calls him "Cueball."
You bet.
And you have sixty-eight dollars and thirty-seven cents in the bank. Your only source of income are my veteran's death benefit of forty dollars a month, to which you're no longer entitled since I'm alive, and these ten dollar a month cash deposits you make.  What are those?
Why don't you two get out there and dance?
Jesus...
Did I what?
A few.
I'm not happy about this, mind you, but if I have to go, at least I'm going in my own bed, the same bed my Lily died in, and... knowing that my son is alive.  That's not too shabby, is it?
You know I'm not a communist, don't you, Jer?
Pete... go home.  Come on, I'll call that girlfriend of yours, what's her name... Sandy?
And you don't know your name or who you are, that right?
What is it?
That's me and my daughter Adele. My pride and joy.  Charms the fish right out of the lake, she does.
You smell gas?
Well, his rent's past due and he said to call you in case of an emergency.  He lose his job or somethin'?
Take a hike.  Am-scray.
Peter, I believe in you.  More to the point, I read your new script... um...
Exactly.
Lest we forget, Peter, your own military career was somewhat less illustrious than Luke's.
That was quite a show you gave them today.  We shoulda sold tickets.
When'd you quit smoking?
Not at all.
Leo, she was... she was a girl I knew in college...
Oh god, oh, god, no, I...
Sit.  Play with me.
Can I... Can I t-t-talk to you?
I'm... I'm not Luke.  Luke is dead. He died in the war.  He's not coming back, and I'm not him.  I don't even belong here.  This whole thing started out as an accident, and that's all it is.  An accident.
That you got let go.
Will you help me, Sandy?
I suppose.  Thanks.
Yes?
Are you a friend of Mitch's?
I've been wanting a cigarette for the past twenty minutes, but I couldn't convince myself to stop. This 'tilling of the soil' can get a little compulsive, you know.
Thank you. It gives me something to do with my spare time.  There's a lot of spare time in Bodega Bay.  Did you plan on staying long?
You're leaving after you see Cathy?
Did you drive up from San Francisco?
Oh, hi!  Did you find her all right?
That sign.  Do you think I could have the room for a single night?
I would appreciate it. I've tried everywhere in town, and they're all full.
Hi.  Is something wrong? Is that cut beginning to bother you?
Or would you rather I changed the subject?
Well, I don't suppose it offers much to the casual visitor. Unless you're thrilled by a collection of shacks on a hillside. It takes a while to get used to.
You needn't worry. It's over and done with. A long time ago.
Isn't there?  Maybe there isn't. Maybe there's never anything between Mitch and any girl.
I think I'll have some of that, too.  I was seeing quite a lot of him in San Francisco, you know.  And then, one weekend, he asked me up to meet Lydia.
Four years ago. Of course, that was shortly after his father died.  Things may be different now.
Then maybe it isn't different at all. You know, her attitude nearly drove me crazy. I simply couldn't understand it.
Then why did she object to you?
Do you think I should go?
Mitch knows lots of people in San Francisco. Of course, they're mostly hoods.
Mitch, can I bring the lovebirds in here?
They're beautiful! They're just what I wanted! Is there a man and a woman? I can't tell which is which.
Why, it's just like air, isn't it?  When I grow up, I'm gonna smoke like a chimney! I'll be eleven tomorrow, you know.
Don't you like us?
Don't you like Bodega Bay?
Oh. Where d'you want the coffee?
Yeah, but she'll be hitting all that traffic going back to San Francisco.
Good morning.
I wonder if you could help me.
See where I'm pointing?
Where would I get a boat?
Daniels.
Gulls!
How do you do, Miss Daniels?  Acknowledge a what?
Whose side are you on?
In a bird shop.
But she did buy the lovebirds and then brought them all the way...
She is the one who jumped into that fountain in Rome last summer, isn't she?
When?
I couldn't ask you to.
What's more likely, they got in the room and was just panicked, that's all.
These birds were...
He was killed last night. By birds.
Bodega Bay? Where's that?
I wonder if you could help me.
Well... yes, sir, there are.
I understand completely, sir.
Well, we can't just let them fly around the shop, you know.
Some of them are.
But how... how do you know my name?
We never met in court or anyplace else.
When?
And I'm glad you didn't get your lovebirds!
So you're a lawyer.
Oh, no you don't!
You like me, huh?
With... with Annie, of course.
Annie... Annie may have made other plans. I'll have to see. Besides, I can find my own way.
You'll be able to find your way back, won't you?
So you didn't go to school together.
You were lying.
I really shouldn't have any more. I'm a little tipsy already.
On Mondays and Wednesdays, I work for the Travelers' Aid. At the airport.
Last night? What do you mean?
Not at first. Oh yes, a few sparrows out for kicks...
And all the while, that sparrow was getting in his little messages. Birds of the world, unite!
What it was, probably...
They're probably hungry, that's all. This was a bad summer. They eat berries and... and nuts, you know, and the hills are all burned out, so they're probably searching for food wherever they can get it.
Melanie, Melanie...
Where are they heading?
You'd have been safe in San Francisco.
Certainly not. Oh, no. Certainly not. This will be a full grown myna bird. Full grown.
That... that... who was that?
I just came from the school, madam. I don't know about their brain pans but...
For what purpose?
Birds?
We need them.
I'm going out that way, lady. You can follow me.
I'm leaving! Are you coming?
Dr. MacFarlane said I should pay you --
I didn't mean it that way.  I meant only that I am not in a position to ask favors.
But Richardson?
But, I didn't ask him to kill.
Don't you want to find the white horse, Georgina?  You can't find him from a wheelchair.  You have to walk and run to find him.
I thought this was a school day.
You know what you want and don't want -- so that's an end of business between us -- but we'll still be friends, Toddy.  I'll be dropping by to see you and Meg once in a while -- for auld lang syne, you know.
I set those blocks together, patched the muscles. I put the nerves where they should be -- I did it and I did it right -- and she won't walk --
But what makes a thought start?
What are you going here? Have I not told you --
I brought you something tonight, MacFarlane -- an interesting specimen -- in very good condition.
Surely you are not threatening an old friend, Toddy.
What I was going to say is this -- wouldn't you be more comfortable at Leith in a neat little house?
Can anyone hear what we say?
Child seems to take to the lad. What sort of an accident was it, Ma'am?
How long ago?
I regret it, Ma'am, but I have the responsibility of training thirty other doctors to attend a thousand children like your own.
I'm sorry, Doctor.  Georgina's a good child -- a brave child -- you saw how she was during the operation -- but if she can't move, she can't move.
You think it'll spoil the boy, eh? Was I not assistant to Knox?
Nonsense.  You're a fey creature with mad ideas.  But you have a wildness that holds me to you, lass.
You're not going to Gray.
I hate that picture.
It was one thing her dad rejected you. But when she did you lost it.
What's been holding me together is the hope that maybe you do go someplace. And I'll be seeing her again soon. Only what will I say? That I was too stupid to find the guy who killed her? That he's down here laughing?
We won't.
Two down. Two to go.
I was hoping you'd find out.
Think maybe knives do?
Hey. I said what I saw. Two kids arguing. A guy and a girl.
One chance to tell the truth, Tommy. Who is the man with the scar? He planted this in my car.
What did they give you?
Fuck. Me.
And he's right over there by the way.  What did you do to your face?
You killed that cop Dutton.
I wish I could hate him but I can't. He said he'd never hurt either of us, and I know it's true and... I'm going back.
In the woods you said you had nothing. But you wouldn't, and I wouldn't if there's some way you don't have to go. Please. At least not right away.
Guy dressed for Halloween?
They botched the execution.
Anything wrong?
But you, you've had them.
Why are there so many?
I want to take this to Lauren. She'd want it.
Stay in the car. I'll only take a second.
Erin!
I think I dropped an earring.
Good. Did you speak to our friend Mr. Carpenter?
Yes -- that will reproduce the first- order terms. But what about the effect of the other terms?
You have faith, Professor Barnhardt
I would like to explain something of my mission here.
It was my intention to discuss this officially -- with all the nations of the Earth -- but I was not allowed the Opportunity. I have come to realize since that your mutual fears and suspicions are merely the normal reactions of a primitive society.  We know from scientific observation that you have discovered a rudimentary kind of atomic energy. We also know that you are experimenting with rockets.
I came here to warn you that, by threatening danger, your planet faces danger -- very grave danger. I am prepared, however, to offer a solution.
Would you be willing to meet with the group of scientists I am calling together?. Perhaps you could explain your mission to them, and they in turn could present it to their various peoples.
What about your personal safety in the meantime? What about the Army -- and the police?
Such power exists?
I wouldn't want you to harm anybody -- or destroy anything.
Bet he is, Mom. Bet he's out looking for that space man.
Can I help you look for the space man? Can I?  I know what he looks like! He's got a square head -- and, three great big eyes!
We sure had fun today. We saw the space ship and we went to see Professor Barnhardt -- and--
Tell me what?
Now, Bobby, just a minute--
Bobby, you've been dreaming again.
Are you an FBI man?
Boy, I'll bet he's strong. I bet he could knock down a whole building.
Maybe four thousand miles an hour. And outside the Earth's atmosphere a good deal faster.
You think they'll ever find him?
Did all these people die in wars?
Aw, gee -- we didn't finish our story.
Oh, I'd say forty-five.
The President asked me to convey his deepest apologies for what has happened. We all feel--
I'm sure I don't have to point out that your arrival was something of a surprise.  Had you been traveling long?
You must have come a long way.
It's rather difficult for us to think of another planet as a neighbor.
Perhaps you'd rather discuss it personally with the President--
You know about the United Nations?
I will make that recommendation to the President.  I must tell you in all honesty that I'm extremely dubious about the results.
Our problems are very complex, Mr. Klaatu. You mustn't judge us too harshly.
Hello--
I was talking to Mr. Carpenter.
You think it's all right for you to stay here?
Helen, he's the man from the space ship!  I had that diamond checked at three different places. Nobody on earth's ever seen a stone like that! After what Bobby told us, that's enough for me. Why is it nobody knows anything about him? Why hasn't he got any money?
Important? Of course it's important. The point is we can do something about it.
You wait and see. You're going to marry a big hero!
Everyone seems so-- 
He's a fine boy, Mrs. Benson.
I saw Bobby this morning before he went to school--
I was.
We'll miss you very much -- Bobby and I.  He won't have anyone to play with.
Well, he's not here. And he won't be back till this evening.  I think you'd better leave now. Unruffled, Klaatu turns to the desk and scribbles something on a scratch pad. He tears off the piece of paper and hands it to Hilda.
No -- no, thanks.
But I suppose you know the answer.
Well, how do I know who you are?
I don't like horror comics.
The nightcrawler.  The bloodsucker.
Should I run him through?
They're looking at us.
We are awesome monster-bashers!
We still going?
What's going' on?
Where's Star, David?!
And these Archies should be over here with the Richie Rich's.
I said, <u>I'll take you there</u>. Nobody's going near Star without me.
Don't go out there!  Stop him!
Good!
Oh... I was just... having a look at your truck.  What's all that wood in there for?
Hi... I'm Laddie.
You like Michael.
He looks dead.
I'll hitch.
See you later.
We are...
Help me, Mom.  Help.
Lights out, Sam.
What's wrong?  Tell me.
Where's Michael?
These are my dinner guests. Edgar and Alan.  The Frog Brothers.
Nanook, stop breathin' on me.
Ohmygod...
Not impressed, are you?
Yeah.  Runaways, mostly.  They come from all over.  Attracted by the boardwalk and the ocean.  Lucy... listen I know I have no right to ask you this... but don't look for another job just yet... I mean besides being the best employee I have... I think you're cute.
Is it okay for the guest to see the food before the dinner?
Let me tell you something about boys.  They're like weeds.  They grow best when they're ignored.
Will somebody please tell me what this is all about!?
Ex-hippies.  My mom was one.   I came this close to being called Moon Child, or Moon Beam or something.  But Star's great.  I <u>like</u> Star.
I guess you're new around here.
Ouch.
I have to talk to you.  Can I come up?
Then it's not too late for us...
Huh?
What!?  He <u>can</u> and I <u>can't</u>?!  No fair!!
Mom, you hitched all the way to Berkeley once, remember?
Do I have to do this?
Michael?
What happened, Michael!?
What about Nonook?  What have you done to Nanook?!  What have you done to my dog, you asshole?!
What??
Michael!  Get behind the wheel.
What's the matter?
What do you mean "got" to the dog?
What the hell you looking at me like that for?
Listen to me, Garry.  Please...
Know what you mean, Blair.  Trust is a tough thing to come by these days. Just trust in the Lord.
What?
Fuchs...?  No, it's not Fuchs... You must let me back in... I won't harm anyone... I promise...
Childs, where's that magneto from Chopper One?
Auxiliary light cables...?  Been cut.
He's so close.  Maybe our best chance to blow him away.
Lighten your load, sucker.  You ain't the judge and executioner around here!
MacReady!
I can get maybe another five or six feet out of it.
Torch them!!
We found your clothes -- the ones you tried to burn.
Load of bullshit.
Maybe we shouldn't make it.
Now hold him.
Gotta be from the Norwegian camp.
How many in their party?
We're a thousand miles from anybody else, man.  It's going to get a hell of a lot worse before it gets better.
Couple seconds of an Argentine disco station.
Look, if you're going to keep bitching, MacReady -- Palmer's offered to take him up...
No it ain't there.  Would I be asking if it were there?
Where was he trying to go?
What about Childs?
Get back!!
No one ever comes here.  My mother told me stories about it late at night.  They tell all the children.
I had a friend who came here once. Sort of a dare.
I think we should go on by ourselves.
But you escaped.
We need your help.
Yes...
Yes... Are you sure you want to do this?
Vox?
Why did they built it?
I'm babbling.  Good to have someone to talk to for a change... But you need to go.  Take her out of here...  ... I don't have long.
I should hope not...  ... Alexander... Make them read my books.  Tell them who they are. Who they could be.
But this is barbaric!  Have you completely lost all sense of --
So you take their best...
Now will you go?
That was a foolish thing to do.
I could have a hundred Morlocks here in thirty seconds.
I'm tired of running.
But you've earned a reward for your valor.  I think you should become. You'll like it here.  Once you get used to the darkness.
It's spectacular...
Well, much obliged -- I'm always forgetting the confounded brake -- say, if you wait until I get her up and running I'll give you a perambulation.  Tell you all about her.
I am the Fifth Avenue Public Library informational kiosk.  VOX registration NY-114.  May I help you?
Well, considering it is, in fact, happening, I would assume it's possible.  The retrograde orbit began in 2005 when the demolitions for the lunar colonies --
Oh dammit, I love you!  I can't eat, I can't sleep, I can't think, all I do is moon over you and -- hum, apparently.
Dance with me...
All right...
All these clocks -- how can you constantly be running late?!
I've been working.
I'm sorry, David.
It's my Jamie's birthday today. Your godson.  He's nine years old. At his party he asked me if Uncle Alex was coming.  I told him no. Then he asked me if you didn't like him anymore.
David... I appreciate your concern, I do.  But I ask you to have faith in me.  Just for a little while longer.  I'm working on something now.  Something... extraordinary.
I can't leave when I'm so close.
Good night, David.
This... was my home.
Yes.
It's hard for me to imagine a better place.  Where I come from there's so much... frenzy.  Day and night.  It seems we're all running faster and faster...  ... All in identical bowler hats.
I'll take you to your machine tomorrow.
Good night, then.
You share dreams?  That's incredible.
And this is your "work"?
It's not supposed to be easy, it's supposed to be beautiful.
It has no purpose.  It's just beautiful... Does everything have a purpose where you come from?
It's always been this way here.  We work on the towers all our lives. When we're young we train to be planners or climbers or sculptors...
And there's no shame to that.  It's all the same here.  Everyone has an important job to do.  We all work together and couldn't survive without each other.
Those rocks, over there... they're the same... this is... Central Park.
This is where my journey started... right here.
Yes.
Don't torture me -- do you have it?
Now that's more like it.  You look a proper gentlemen for once.
All right, Mrs. Watchit.  You can go.
Sir, that curriculum is forty years out of date.  The students today are looking toward the new century -- they want to be challenged and inspired, not spoon-fed dusty old equations that have been proved a thousand times.  They want to explore.
He said he traveled for two months.
What do you mean?!
You know that's not true.
How did you get hurt?
I found you.  I saved your life. You were bleeding all over the place!
I'm just looking at you. Does that make you uncomfortable?
And what's that?
Yes.
Becker, how do you sleep at night?
Did you know my father?
My father used to talk about you.
Look here, I don't like you getting in my face and saying this bullshit to me...
We're late.
You look like you've lost some weight. Are you eating?
You done with your small talk?
And I can't stay here in my condition. I am going to die tonight. It's already been decided.
I'm sorry? Your face looks awfully familiar, I just can't quite place it...
[Beat] What's your name?
Do you really believe me?
Of course it makes me mad. It makes me more than mad. Just like remembering the face of the man who killed that officer and knowing nothing more about him. But what's it gonna do for me to find them now? I can't fix everything in three days.
I might not be able to.
Me, too.
Then why isn't there anyone around?
Of course he will. [Beat] What day of the week is it?
If everything hadn't happened the way it has, then I wouldn't be here right now, sitting in a car with you, touching your face.
[Beat] You be good to yourself, Jackie.
I think so.
It's ok. It's ok. Relax. It's just a cut. We can get it fixed. But we need to get you to the hospital now. How'd you get that?
Because Becker resigned after the charges brought against him by State Patient Advocacy Groups.
Why, what would you do?
Well, do you think Dr. Becker would have any idea?
So maybe Dr. Becker would know. [Beat] But, as I'm sure you know, the statute of limitations has run out for charging the hospital with any liabilities.
It's important for you to know who your father was, isn't it?
I don't know. [Frustrated] Remember?
The future doesn't look different?
What about the world?
How do you know about Eugene?
You told me this was how it happened.
I'm not gonna let that happen.
I do believe you...
You know how to get there?
It's gonna be sticky.
Can you drive?
If you're deaf, read my lips...I don't need a psycho following me today.
Well, where are you from?
Because in my life, it wouldn't make sense for me to pick up some normal guy with a place where he's from and a place where he's going to. It'd be too simple. I probably wouldn't know how to handle a situation like that.
Where are you going? You'll freeze out there. You don't even have a coat.
[Beat] Yeah, I'm fine.
You don't think that's crazy?
But hey, who can forget those words? The man just wants simple and good things for his woman -- that she be warm and happy. How hard can that be to remember?
Hon.
I'm asking you seriously, Sarah, a stranger?
Could you identify 'em, if ya saw 'em again?
You didn't happen to notice what kind of car they were driving?
I swear to God, she wouldn't tell me one thing!  Christ!  You oughta try to find that kid that was with 'em.
Good God.
It's just not working like this.  We gotta do something.  It'd be one thing if these girls were hardened criminals, but Jesus, Hal, this is makin' us look bad.  I don't know... maybe they're not movin'.  Maybe that little creep lied.
Your name's Harlan?  I got an uncle named Harlan!
Stop.
I guess I'm startin' to feel a little better.
So J.D., what are you studying in school?
So how come you don't have any kids?
Oh.  I... where's Louise?
You're a bank robber?
What?
I may be the outlaw, but you're the one stealin' my heart.
Jimmy!  Hello, stranger.  What in the world are you doin' here?
I am funny.  I'm real funny.
Okay.  I'll call you back.  In an hour.  Don't tell Darryl.
Is that how you answer the phone?
Hello...
Now, my little coconut, what seems to be the trouble here?  Tell Daddy everything.
Can I just ask you one other thing?
You wanna take it out of your wallet, please?
Is this your car?
You wanna come with me, please? Walk around and get in the car, please.
Well, wait now.  I still have to ask Darryl if I can go.
Not this weekend, sweetie, she's runnin' away with me.  Hi.  What'd he say?
I don't know.  Warm stuff, I guess. It's the mountains.  I guess it gets cold at night.  I'm just gonna bring everything.
'Cause I didn't ask him.
Thelma!
Alright...  I changed my mind.  I'll have a margarita with and a shot of Cuervo on the side, please.
Oh my God.
Shouldn't we go to the cops?  I mean, I think we should tell the police.
If you weren't so concerned with having a good time, we wouldn't be here right now.
What do you mean?
You could help me try and figure it out!  I gotta figure out what to do, and you could try and help me.
Well, what's the big rush, Thelma? If we just give 'em some time, they'll come to us...!  Oh Christ. I'm just not ready to go to jail yet.  Why don't you go out to the pool or something and I'll figure it out...
Louise, this young man is on his way back to school and needs a ride, and I thought since...
I just don't see what it would hurt just to give somebody a ride.  Did you see his butt?  Darryl doesn't have a cute butt.  You could park a car in the shadow of his ass.
Thelma, please get a hold of yourself.  You're making a spectacle.
I want you to call Darryl.
Fill her up.  There's a phone right over there.
That J.D. kid is a little shit.
Oh yeah.  You mean Peek-a-poos.
I mean, look how different he looks just since high school.  It's bad enough I have to get old, but doin' it with Darryl around is only gonna make it worse.  I mean, I don't think he's gonna be very nice about it.
Look!  Look who it is, Thelma.  I'll be darned.  What's he doin' way out here.
I am really sorry about this.
Louise... are we still going to Mexico?
What?
You're not gonna give up on me, are ya?
And we have to decide whether we want to come out of this dead or alive.
No.
Me too.  I feel awake.
We'll be drinkin' margaritas by the sea, Mamasita.
We've gone insane.
I guess we shoulda made some kinda plan for what to do if we get caught.
Shit!
They'll probably catch us when we have to stop for gas!
You're a good friend.
I guess everything from here on in is going to be pretty shitty.
Go.
You women are crazy!
Isn't that just my luck -- I get caught for everything.
You're leaving it out. Finish your swing.  You're going to like this one -- she's half Asian, half American.
Nah.
Mary again.
I don't know about this, Dom.
And you think he could find out her number for me?
Mary's a babe!
My Mary -- she's not in Japan, she's single, and she's got no rugrats. She does have a little gambling problem, she plays the football cards a bit too much, but she's a babe, a surgeon babe!
Tell her the truth about Healy! Blow the schmuck out of the water.
You know, clean the pipes.
Think about it: After you've had sex with a girl and the two of you are laying in bed, are you nervous?
The most honest moment in a man's life is the five minutes after he's blown a load. That's a medical fact. And it's because you're no longer trying to get laid. You're actually thinking like a girl. They love that.
Bob, do you remember Mary?
Why don't you be a gentleman and ask Rosey?
Stalker, huh?
Uh, I'm fine. Just wanted to let you know I'll have your car back in a couple hours, I'm still staking out this girl's apartment.
The sawbones?
Oh yeah.
Oh cripes. Do you have change for a dollar? All I have is these stupid Nepalese coins.
Well... it's just a condo really. Right outside Katmandu.
Here. Spend it on your trip to Katmandu.
Don't you want to know my name?
I work with retards.
Well it's more of an enclosure really.
The museum? I thought we were going out to dinner?
You know, sometimes I wish I could be like Magda and not go home. I'd like to just bounce around for awhile, do a little traveling...
I guess.
Mary ah, forget it.
No, forget it, it was stupid.
Turn it up, Magda.
No!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Don't play games with me, Ted.
You want her dead, don't you?
Well I'm guessing. There's a black kid, two whites, and a midget.
Hyperactive little fuckers, too. Tough to keep up with in a wheelchair, I bet.
Thanks, Healy. Good work.
Jai alai?
Look, uh, I've been thinking about everything you told me.
All the same, I still want to call her. I know it sounds crazy -- Mary sure has a lot of troubles in her life -- but, I don't know, maybe I can help her out.  The poor thing's had it tough -- she's in a wheelchair for Godsakes.
Mary's a mail-order bride?
You fucked me, man? Why would you do that?
Turn her over to a stalker.
Well you didn't have to blow us both out of the water. Jesus Christ, just because she found out about you, why'd you have to take me down with you?
I'm talking about the letter, asshole.
Do you know the... soccer stadium?
I mean I'm a fucking fraud. I'm no architect. Don't be a putz -- who's been to Santiago twice in a year?  Estadio Olimpico -- please!
Oh yeah, the plan was going along just fine until you showed up.
Like I'm going to try to figure out a guy who's idea of courting is blowing farts in the chick's face
Thanks for picking me up.
Sucks. So what's up? You some kind of salesman or something?
I see where you're going.
I'd go with the seven.
I can live with those reflections.
Yeah, Steve. Steve was all right for awhile.
Have you been up all night again?
Neighborhood Watch? Is that what you call listening in on stranger's phone conversations?
Sure.  Uh, Magda, why don't you get some more cheese and crackers...?
Hey hey, what did you say Pat's last name was?
You don't think they're too big?
I mean let's face it, Mary, you're beautiful, you've got money, you trust people -- I'm just saying, there's a lot of psychos out there.
What's up?
I think you'd better sit down.
Oh, are you on the team?
Are you all right?
Oh my God... Ted.  What are you...? I can't believe this. I haven't seen you since --
I'm kidding. I'd really love to, Ted, but the thing is I already have plans. How about tomorrow night?
Hey.
What's that?
Now by killer, you mean...?
Jeez, Mary... I'm...
We should play some time... I mean, if you can afford to lose some money.
Twenty-two.
Well good for you. I bet it works out for you.
...and then it was all over.  We haven't spoken since.
Yeah... almost.  You want to come up and watch Sportscenter?
That's really sweet, Ted, but you should save it for one of your books.
Um, Ted, I need a moment with Magda -- would you let the dog out of the bathroom.
Get out.
Please leave.
Go!
What what are you doing here?
Jesus Christ, guy, what the hell were you doing?!
OH FOR THE LOVE OF GOD!
No, no, please!
Well, there's only one thing to do.
Eh.
There's still no sign they know that we know about the missiles. Been a lot of cloud cover; probably think we aren't getting any good product.
We have to pull him. He's not going to be able to handle the Soviets in front of the U.N. Zorin will eat him alive.
Jack, I'm as conniving as they come, but a sneak attack is just wrong.
Jesus...
My father --
We're getting everyone together as fast as we can.
We gave so much to get here. I don't know. Sometimes I think what the hell did we do it for?
You gotta stop 'em. We know it's Jack and Bobby's idea -- they leaked it to Lippman. The military guys are going ape, and they're not alone.
I am instructed to tell you that the American Government would respond favorably to an offer along the lines you have discussed. If this solution were raised at the U.N. by Ambassador Zorin, he would find a favorable reply from Ambassador Stevenson.
Yes. From the Highest Authority. There are two conditions. The U.N. must be allowed to inspect the removal of the missiles.
How's my favorite President?
I want an hour with him.
Kenny! What happened? They didn't let me up front, said the President was on the phone the whole time.
Yeah? Who was he talking to? Acheson? Come on, O'Donnell, everyone's wondering what's going on. What's Acheson doing in town? And don't give me some bullshit about DNC think tanks. Acheson's Mr. Cold War.
There are major rail disruptions in the South, two airborne divisions are on alert. That exercise is an invasion.
So what've we got today?
No choice. This is going to cost lives any way we go. Do nothing, and it could be 80 million of ours. We have to get rid of those missiles.
I don't care. Cancel it.
You'd worry that something was wrong if Congress offered you unconditional support.
Dangle a settlement, tie us down in negotiations, we come up short...
My specialists are in agreement: this morning's letter is not Khruschev. Last night's letter was.  The evidence supports only one conclusion: there has been a coup, and Khruschev was replaced overnight.
Bob?
Captain, force the sub to the surface for inspection.
I see.
What are you doing?
What's this about?
Who are you?
-- violation of the Major Crimes Act on an Indian Reservation is within the jurisdiction of the Federal Bureau of Instigation. I know that.
What the hell you doing?!
Somebody was serious about doing this guy, that's for sure.
This is a restricted area.
I did.
No. That's Ray here. Ray...
Water. Worth killing for out here, I'd think.
Who is he?
They obviously wanted it to be known that they offed Leo. Some kind of statement.
What'd she say?
She took something from the house. What she called a medicine bundle. Most likely Jimmy's.
Her oil pan is shot.
Cooch.  Where the fuck did they send us?
The right man? Talk to me, Ray.
Come on, Ray. Come forward.
Big sonuvabuck. Based on the depth of that print, pressure releases... I'd say he goes two-ten, two-fifteen --
You got no know-how. About Indian Way. Or about Jack Shit for that matter.
To us Indians, our spiritual relatives are as close as family. I've got seven mothers on this reservation. Sisters. Brothers. You ain't one of them.
What did he say?
But he is not unhappy with you because he knows you.
What was he saying?
The owl told him about Leo. That's incredible. I guess we just broke the back of this investigation, didn't we? Evidence doesn't get any harder than that -- not for my money. Is there anyway we can seduce this owl into Federal Court?
Don't be mad. That was just an old traditional gesture that means hello, how are you.
I can't do that,  It's a Rolex.
Walter. When I fill out my 302, do I say that evil spirits are killing everybody on the reservation?
I can't be dicking around here. That's all I'm saying. I don't carry crystals, I don't wanna come back in another life. I just wanna do my job, and do it right, and get the fuck outta here.
Still after Jimmy?
Five-hundred year old turtleshell rattle...
You got Jimmy. Let her go.
Sonuvabuck! What's with you, Man? Who are you?
Leo knew about it. Tried to tell Jimmy, get the Warriors involved.
Ain't no Council Fire, Brother. Clear Moon...
He's gone.
What about the water...
You burned an American flag today. And left it for me...
I have a pick-up truck. No plates. Subject -- Indian -- entering suspect's house. Over.
With an Indian representative out there, we hope to keep hostilities dormant; this is a COINTELPRO, Selective Operations Unit, and it'll be easier on Agent Couture if you can gain the people's trust and maybe --
Washington sent ya. I know that.
The men who came to see you at Leavenworth. The one's who made the arrangement... who were they? Maybe I can talk to them.
Now I know why all the girls come here. They know how horny you guys get. But this...is ridiculous.
It isn't?
I thought he'd never leave.
Everybody's got to be somewhere.
It would have been really embarrassing!
Where did you see that?
If you were directly above him, how did you see him?
You seemed determined to do that anyway.. Why didn't you tell me you were a famous MiG insulter? MAVERICK Would it have made a difference?
What would you say, too fast...too quick...
Lieutenant...
And probably never again. It's nothing personal. It's just...I know a lot of pilots. Maybe I'm immune...
That's true. What are you?
Lucky charm.
This is it, then.
The dark side. The price you pay for all the fun you're having. You knew about it, of course. Didn't you?
I want it back.
You look way out there. Out past the date line. West becomes East, all things change. You cross the line...today becomes yesterday...or tomorrow, I forget which.
What do you do when you come here?
How do you play reality.
Now?
One more.
And I'm gonna sneak off, and be by myself for awhile, like until I can think of a new career...hotel management or something...
You got your F-14, you got Top Gun, you got your MiGs....You're our new Top Gun instructor...Now what?
I live here, remember?
Well... What   is   it?
YOU BETTER NOT BE RAGGING ME... IF YOU'RE FLYING UPSIDE DOWN...
That's missile lock!
We're locked on MiG ONE. Why doesn't he disengage?
Hey, if it was easy, everybody would want to come up here and do it..... Instead of just us.
Wait! Hell!..Something's wrong!
WHAT? WHERE'RE YOU--HEY, WHERE IN THE HELL ARE YOU GOING?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN? IT DOESN'T GET TO LOOK MUCH BETTER THAN THAT?
I've got it -- hold on!
No! Not again!
Is it the plane?
You're not supposed to...
What do you want?
Why do you all have such funny names?
Well, it doesn't just happen, you gotta do something famous.
That's not what I heard.
This is Evan Mitchell, he steers the thing.
What are you doing?
Great move. Great
Hi...Hi there. How ya doing in there?  Mav... Ahhh...you know, at one point I did want a Navy career.
STAY WITH HIM! TIGHTEN YOUR TURN!
Relationships are a bitch, here. It's hard enough to concentrate ...under the pressure. Having a woman here is asking for it.
3000 feet. I'll do it.
That's Kazanski.
No, we...got our butts kicked.
It's kind of ironic. All you guys have women troubles and I don't.
ENGAGING BANDIT 12 O'CLOCK.
I guess I owe you one.
You're a hell of a flyer.  You can be my wingman any time.
Who is the best.
Need a hint?
The hard deck for this hop was ten thousand feet. Jester, at what point did you call off the fight?
WALKED RIGHT INTO IT.
Ah, the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat.
It was bad.
You just did an incredibly brave thing! What you should have done was land your plane. You don't own that plane, the taxpayers do. I should ream you out for it. But it just doesn't work with you. You're a hell of a flyer. You are maybe ...too good. You never really stepped in it yet. So this is your chance. I'm gonna send you up against the best. They are better than you. Maybe they'll knock that shine off your eagle and you'll see, finally, where discipline and teamwork fit it. Maverick hasn't really heard anything but TOPGUN. He snaps out of it.
Maverick... Where'd you get that call sign?
Skipper, sorry to bother you.
We can send you back to your squadron with nothing noted on your record except "CNC" --course not completed, no explanation required. Theoretically, it doesn't hurt your career, but people always wonder about things like that.
Not something they tell dependents.
You think I shouldn't fly.
Where's yours?
Welcome to Mars.
Need a ride?
And if you wanna breathe, you gotta but his air.
Never mind.  Wet a towel and wrap it around your head.  That'll muffle the signal.
Nice to have you back with us, Mr. Brubaker.
The guy's a fucking asshole.
Come on, Cohaagen!  You got what you want.  Give these people air!
What are you afraid of?  Turn it on.
Do you expect me to believe you?
Stop fighting and get out.
I say we throw the switch and see what happens.
What the fuck is going on here?!  You can't install a simple goddamn double implant?!
I'm afraid that's not possible.
Good evening...  Doug.  I'm Dr. Lull.
Your sexual orientation?
Demure, aggressive, sleazy?  Be honest.
Mr. Cohaagen wants to see you right away.
Quaid!  That's Quaid!
I don't know.
They found us!  Everybody out!
Hey Harry...Harry!  You ever heard of Rekall?
Hey, Quaid!
What was that?  I couldn't hear you.
That son of a bitch got to be around here somewhere.
He's not at ground level.
I've got a lock!  There!
Nobody?!  What's her name?
Sweetheart, we've been through this a million times.  You'd hate it on Mars. It's dry; it's ugly; it's boring!  --I mean, really, a revolution could break out there any minute.
Well...What do you say?
What are you doing?
Muggers?!  Doug, are you all right? What happened?
You think I'm an idiot?  Remember our wedding?
O.K. then.  If I'm not me, then who the hell am I?
Now help me out here, Doug.  You were interested in a memory of...
...What?
I thought you didn't like me.
Not bad, for a hooker.
Are you all right?  Are you still you?
What's wrong?
You guys all set?
Okay, Burt, listen.  Forget shooting them.  Tell me this: can you get to your truck?
Yeah, still got one poking around.
Knock it off, Burt!
What do you think?  Max firepower or...?
What the hell you doing back already?
Burt, get out!  Get up on your roof or someplace!  We found out what's been killing people!  They're under the ground!
Jesus Christ...think it smells like that 'cause it's dead?
Well, at least the bastard can't climb.  Pardon my French.
You know, up the jeep trail.
You're really leaving, huh?
Nothing.  But it sure might be a nice way of getting to know her.
Goddamnit, Valentine, you won't go for any gal unless she fits that damn list of yours A to Z...
Well, I'm a victim of circumstance.
Why don't his parents ever take him to Vegas with them?
So?  That car wash pays good, and they're always looking.
What keeps us doing jobs like this is you dragging your feet.  I was up for going to Bixby.  I was getting excited.
Car's gone.  We just missed them, that's all.
Here's the plan...We don't <u>even</u> stop.  Ride like hell.  Tonight we keep right on going.  We'll walk the horses.
Here's the plan: we'll get a...a flatbed, I guess, with a big winch, figure a five ton anyway.
We'll take your word for it.
You know, I hate to be crude, but I'm gonna have to take care of some business here.
You go north, I'll go south.
They're...they're trying to make us move!
Somebody paying you to do this?
She likes <u>both</u> of us.  We both helped her out.
Forget it.  I got vegetables coming out my ears.  Usually the varmints eat up half my crop, but lately I ain't so much as <u>seen</u> a gopher or a jack-rabbit nowheres.
We playing cards tonight?
Down, honey, down.
I'm dead.  Let's finish in the morning.
What?
I don't believe this.  The phone is out!  Pham, your phone is out!
Well, I'm supposed monitor these seismographs.  You know, they measure vibrations...
Darn it!
You paying attention?  This oughta hurt like hell.
What?!!  Since when the hell's every goddamn thing up to us?!
Look, the situation hasn't changed. We still have to get to solid rock. There must be <u>some</u> way!
It worked!  There they go!
I brought it... to the coroner.
You're fishing. You don't know shit.
...we had to lick his boots clean.
Forensic ballistics isn't an exact science, is it?
Your Honor, that's not fair -- !
Good morning, Mr. Dowd. Do you think you might be up to cross-examining Mr. Ortega this morning?
Well then, does the defense have any witnesses?
How can you remember that?
It's just... I leave behind friends, family, a coupla good job offers in Chicago and in three dizzying weeks I've helped acquit a coke dealer, a speed dealer --
Don't tell me where to work. I moved to New York to work for Edward Dowd. But I can't believe that Edward Dowd has nothing better to do these days than invoke exalted legal issues to get off guilty little --
When did you start working for the goddam D.A.?
Eddie... it's one thing to compare Clyde Gruner to Jesus Christ. It's even okay to claim that Shu Kai Kim is just slightly holier than the Pope... as long as you don't really believe it!
I think he hired Shu to kill Jimmy Chin... It wasn't a Chinatown gang hit -- Jimmy Chin and Art's wife were lovers! She just about told me...!
They could've been brothers. It's why the eyewitnesses picked Shu.
They're Chinamen who speak English. We call them informants.
A fucking wheelchair?
You do.
Eddie this is silly... are we supposed to pretend nothing's happened in the last ten years and --
I need sleep. Some of us are mere mortals.
Figures.
Racist asshole came at me.
What went down?
When you leave this place you're going out to dinner or a movie or get laid. Where's our bond? I'm going back to my cell and wait to die. So tell me: Where's our bond?
I did two tours in 'Nam...
When the D.A. hears I filed the writ, he'll send someone here, maybe claiming to be a journalist. That person will ask you lots of questions. Just be truthful, Cecil, okay? To all of us?
...And you were at the trial to... to see that justice was done?
Then it was your idea to have Chuckie Roeder scare Eddie off the case?
Look. Mister --
Five years.
"Name, rank and serial," Mr. Ortega. Let's not hide behind the Fifth.
And what does a soldado -- a soldier -- do?
If a member of the Aryan Brothers tries to cut in on your distribution?
I think what Eddie wants to say is --
The phone company was broken up.
SEE WHAT WE CAN DO TO DONNA?
No. Never. You'll have to kill me.
Thank you, Bobby. A big score?
No shit...  We killed a guy for baby laxative.
That's not the way to Cliff's trailer. I told you.
What was here, Mr. Rodd?
Is that Agent Desmond's vehicle?
Mrs. Simmons owns the trailer and she lives in town. Teresa rented it about a month ago.
Can I ask you where you were the night Teresa Banks was murdered?
Did you know Teresa Banks?
Yes...
OK, Gordon.
HE'S GONE.
QUICKLY MEN... WORD ASSOCIATION, COOP. WHAT ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW?
Where is the ring?
He didn't suffer.
Take a good look around. There's nobody in this place -- you're meetin' the reason why. What'll it be?
Federal Bureau of Investigation, Special Agent Chet Desmond. I'd like to ask you a few questions about Teresa Banks. Jack said you knew her. How well?
You know, I never told anybody, but once for about three days, just before her time, Teresa's arm went completely dead.
We're heading into a difficult situation.
Oh, the uncle is missing.
The dress she was wearing had been altered to fit her. I noticed a different colored thread where the dress had been taken in. It wasn't her dress or she must have lost some weight.
No one could find those splinters without a machine like this. And no one had a machine like this.
What is it?
I doubt it was drugs, more likely a problem with a nerve. I could recheck the arm for injuries, but for real nerve work we are going to have to take the body back to Portland.
I couldn't help but notice that you had a suspicion that Deputy Cliff was the murderer. You did think that, didn't you, Agent Desmond?
If I am going to get through math today, you're going to have to bring me up to speed quick.
Don't tell me now. Tell me right before the test. I won't be able to remember long enough.
Were you with Bobby? Or are you two still fighting?
Oh god, Laura.
What is it Laura? What's wrong?
Where are you going?
If I had a nickel for every cigarette your mom smoked, I'd be dead.
How did I get in the house? How did I get into my bed?
But I love you, Laura.
My secret diary. There are pages missing.
Bob.
Right on time, baby.
It does matter. We're in love.
You're not a turkey. A turkey is one of the dumbest birds on earth.
This afternoon?
What do you mean?
Say anything you want... I know you love me and I love you.
Bobby killed a guy.
You want to see...
Johnny, Johnny... let your Daddy and your Uncle and Leland talk.  Ben... Leland, we can play the French against the Norwegians. What do the French love more than anything?
No.
Believe me, Josie, you would not offend the customs of this country. For instance, I don't eat fish eyes.
Even if it offended someone, I wouldn't eat a fish eye.
Where's Dad?
Dad.
Are you sure you're okay?
Oh, I thought I saw you.
What are you doing?
Someone who knows how to clean knows where the object was before she started cleaning and then that object goes back to its exact same spot. Shelly, I know where everything in this house is. Sometimes on the road I mentally go through this whole house and picture where every item is.
I'm going to show you how to wash this tile and then you're going to do it.
Four cases in three years...
Yes.
...that was a Dr. David Gruber's office...
You would not...?
Now. I'd like to ask you something: four years ago, when you were working as a nurse, are you aware that Drs. Towler and Marx based their treatment of Deborah Ann Kaye on this chart that you signed...?
They lied.
That's not my handwriting.
Dr. Thompson, just so the Jury knows, you never treated Deborah Ann Kaye. Is that correct?
Engaged to render an opinion. For a price. Is that correct? You're being paid to be here today?
Yes, we've heard that. Doctor: you testify quite a bit against other physicians? Isn't that right? You, you're available for that? When you're paid to be there?
We've touched on this, his own witness has said...
Mr. Concannon...?
No further questions.
Say it.
Answer affirmatively. Simply. Keep those answers to three words. You weren't 'part of a group,' you were her anesthesiologist. Isn't that right?
It's a common medical expression, it's a crash program to restore the heartbeat. Dr. Marx cut an airway in her trachea, to get her oxygen, her and the baby... Ms. Nevins...
...to save her and to save the baby. Is that...
You reached down into death. Now, isn't that right?
...the Archdiocese called up, they said who was our attorney, 'cause the case is coming to trial...
I swear to you I wouldn't have turned the offer down unless I thought that I could win the case...
I'm going to win this case... Mist... Mr. Doneghy... I'm going to the Jury with a solid case, a famous doctor as an expert witness, and I'm going to win eight hundred thousand dollars.
Dr. Thompson...?
I'm going to take you to the home to see the girl...
...apartment.  No, no. Please. You don't know who we're dealing with, I, please believe me, they...
These people play very rough. They don't want to lose this case. There's a lot of pressure they can bring to bear, I...
I am seventy-four years old.
Then what good would it do to ruin the reputation of two men, to help a girl whose life's not going to be changed in the least? You know what CODE BLUE means?
Dr. Gruber...
D'you ask the patient when did she last eat?
Yessir. I'm sorry.
Now, have you boys tried to resolve your little difficulty because that certainly would save the Commonwealth a lot of time and bother.
...that's true. Sometimes they change, sometimes they don't. Now, I remember back to when you were disbarred...
I need an extension for my case.
Do we have time this morning to...  All right. Mr. Galvin, you want to continue now, or we can resume with Dr. Thompson this afternoon.
Sustained. Yes. The witness will confine his testimony to review of the hospital records.
Yes, Mr. Galvin?
Listen to me, fella...
Jimmy!  That's why the court exists. The court doesn't exist to give them justice, eh? But to give them a chance at justice.
And it's over...?
Maybe I'll tell you later.
Oh, yes, I do, Joe. Believe me. You say you're going to lose. Is it my fault? Listen! The damned case doesn't start until tomorrow and already it's over for you!
What are you going to do?
Thank you.
I can't guarantee that...
This is Mr. Wallace in Subscriptions?
This is Miss Costello...?
We find that your subscription lapsed...
Yes, we know that you do. I have it in my files. That's at the Manhattan Health Center...
I don't want to leave her. Dick... the, the... and Father Laughlin, he said that it was God's will...
He saw her at the Northern Care...
Are we going to win?  We have, you know, other tactics, though...
Another, Frank...?
Come on. Let's get a drink.
You need my help...? You need a goddamn keeper... are you telling me that you turned down two-hundred-ten grand?  Huh...? Are you nuts? Eh? Are you nuts. What are you going to do, bring her back to life?
...Gruber's not bad.
Right.
Been a long time, huh...?
Today is Tuesday. What?
Yeah? How's our new witness?
That's right.
She's protecting the Doctors she'd be up there on the stand...
'You guys are a bunch of whores... uh... loyalty... you don't care who gets hurt... you don't have any loyalty...'
What the hell are you doing here?
What?
Brain damage could have been... it didn't necessarily take nine minutes, it could have been caused in two...
Stearns, Harrington, you know who that is?
There's nobody left around here now.
Hurry up!  Jump in!
Did you see it come down?
I do know him...slightly.
Well, you certainly don't look like yourself in that get-up!  But I am happy to meet you anyway. I'm Sylvia Van Buren.  I teach Library Science over at USC.
Is that... machine...?
I almost forget when I ate last.  It looks so good.... You know, mostly I get my meals in coffee shops and restaurants.
We'll get safely out of here, don't worry.
Is it possible to go in right after the explosion?
How'd you guess?
I probably wouldn't be able to get to them if I tried...
I got a message for you.  You're the guys from Pacific-Tech, ain't you?
There's one - there's the other, and we're right between them!
General Mann -- I was told to expect you, sir.  I'm Colonel Heffner.
My orders are not to go into action unless they make a move out of there.
Uncle Matthew...this is Dr. Clayton Forrester.  My uncle - Dr. Matthew Collins, pastor of the Community Church.
Better'n a lion farm or a snake pit. We won't have to feed it!
What'll we say to 'em?
Sweetie, you've got lots of fans, we've done market studies.  You rate right up there.  We've already got Chase working on a prototype for the glove.
Bob, how long has Wes been working on this script?
Chase.  Why didn't Chuck or Terry show up?
Yes.
Diabetes?
If these had been a few inches nearer to the wrist... What did you say you cut yourself on?
You going away?
Rex saved me.
You okay, champ?
What...what is that?
Must've read about the funeral.  Sick mother.  That's the last thing you need right now, I'm sure.
Anyway, what I was calling about was...have you seen any of the script, by any chance?
I've never mentioned it to him.
Freddy, for all I know.
Really?
Heather Langenkamp?
I want to see the body.
No, I don't think that at all.  How is he?
Captured?  How?
If Freddy's loose, I mean, in your script, where's he going to go?  Another age?  Another form?
Me?  Why me?
That was Nancy, not me!
Yes?
Uh...sure...when?
Can I get you something to drink?
That low passed through last night. May be a little bumpy out there.
I'd have liked to have said goodbye.
Why did we begin this?
Oh I was walkin' down Lime street one day...
We'll bear off to port and run down wind.
Everyone out of the rigging NOW!
Okay, here's the duty.  Gieg, Weathers, Lapchick, Schucart: scrape and paint.  Corry and Stricklin have the brass.  Robinson, you're the Galley slave.  March you're on chain gang with Barnes. Johnston, solo on bilge detail.
There's still a way.
Why don't you go and try some of that on?
Ninety-six.
It's a ninety-one!  It's an 'A'!
It's no my fault I was born first. Besides, nobody ever sent me on an eight month vacation, so ease up on the sad sack stuff.
I'm just not like you.  Ya know? I'm never going to go to Yale.  I'm never going to be "William".
Hey, shut up will ya?
Sorry to here it.
You taking the order wouldn't have changed anything.
Ya know... "It".
What'd you do?
Who told you that?
It works?
What are they doing?
Hold her steady into the wind. Southwest by west.
Yes, sir.
Well, spit it out.
Chicken is a fool's game captain.
But the Captain ordered you hard to starboard.
So when the captain gave you an order contrary to your training, you thought he was making a mistake?
Humor me.  Eat it anyway.
Who is it Philip?
Son-of-a-bitch.
They think we're carrying Cuban refugees.  Skipper, they mean to board us.
Oh Jesus, oh Jesus.  Man I knew we shouldn't have gone.  I tried to tell you.  I tried to tell you.  You guys made me come!  You made me come!!
How the hell are we gonna get outta here?
Jesus!  What the hell happened to him.
I'll read it.  I mean I don't mind.
If you've got "a broad" available I'll take her.
Damn, Porkchop, you sound just like a guy who ain't never seen a pair.
They tell you that?
It matters to me.
Much have I traveled in realms of gold/ And many goodly states and kingdoms seen/ Round many western islands have I been/ Which bards in fealty to Apollo hold/ Oft of one wide expanse had I been told/ That deep-browed Homer ruled as his demesne.
This isn't just a story!!  It's history made allegory.  It is a philosophical handbook for life!  It holds the secret of this very voyage.
What?
Well, that was neighborly.
What are we supposed to talk about?
I don't know.  We gotta get 'im outta here before Skipper sees him like this.
Don't look down.  Look in my eyes! Climb!  We'll do it together.
Sir, were you aware at any time of the use of alcohol among the crew.
We'd come twelve thousand miles together, through every kind of seas imaginable...
They are much more than that, sir.
There are allegations questioning your competence with regard to the command of the Albatross.  I have been instructed to convene a formal tribunal to determine whether or not negligence played a part in the sinking.
The families... want your ticket. Turn it in, we forget the whole thing.  Everybody goes home.
I'm fine, thank you. I had a cardiac infarction but I'm on a new diet and exercising regularly. I've never felt better.
Need a hand?
No.
I been studyin' a situation over in Lobo, take two men to handle it.
Couple grand or more'd give you two a leg up. Get you to the west coast, Mexico, most anyplace, with a few dollars in your jeans. I got it figured good, Sailor.
Don't think about it too long.  You had enough?
What's she doin' here?
The cobra's waitin' to strike, chica.
Gas?
About. Where Lafitte crosses over Galvez Highway. State Road 86.
Everythin's relative. Where's that Marietta Pace Fortune? You two didn't split up, I hope.
What'll it be? The regular? Black Label?
You hitched yet?
Alright... By all means. Make yourselves at home.
Oh, many things...
That is my permiso.
If your neighbors didn't mind, how'd you get put out of business?
But I'm wild at heart.
I'm sorry to do this to ya here in front of a crowd, but I want ya to stand up and make a nice apology to my girl.
Only that it's supposed to be a pretty poor sight since the hurricane came through last year.
In what capacity?
I knew this would happen. Soon as that piece of filth got out of Pee Dee, I knew there'd be trouble. He's just got some kind of influence over her I can't decipher. There's somethin' wild in Lula I don't know where it comes from. You gotta find 'em, Johnnie.
Maybe I was there, but I didn't see anythin'. All I know's that trash killed a man with his bare hands. Hands which are now prob'ly all over my baby!
What?
Johnnie, I can't tell you, honey. Is there anyway we can get on the road tonight? We've got to find them kids.
Who?... Uncle Pooch?...
I still ain't sure what my daddy looks like.
Hey baby...
Hey, my snakeskin jacket... Thanks, baby... Did I ever tell you that this here jacket for me is a symbol of my individuality and my belief in personal freedom?
In a fire, as I recall.
Sailor, you are somethin' else, honey... When I was fifteen, Mama told me that pretty soon I'd be startin' to think about sex, and I should talk to her before I did anything about it.
I said you can be too crude sometimes? I don't think I care for it.
So how'd he finally nail you? Right there in the kitchen?
He was short but powerful. With hairy arms? Anyway, he carried me into the maid's dayroom which nobody used. We did it there on an old bed.
You okay, honey?
What's that honey?
That don't seem fair.
It was my cousin, Dell, done it? His folks used to visit with us summers.
One time, Aunt Rootie caught Dell puttin' one big cockroach on his anus?
The private eye cost Aunt Rootie over a thousand dollars? Then a little while later Dell ran off a third time to some place he said would "give him peace of mind." Nobody's seen him since.
Too bad we all can't, baby... One thing about Dell?
One thing puzzles my mind, sugar... You're twenty years old - aren't you ever curious why your mama has this fixation on keepin' us apart? Puttin' a detective on us. I'll tell ya Lula... Well... It's more'n me killin' Bob Ray Lemon...
Sorry, baby... When's the first time you done it with a girl who wasn't hookin'?
What'll it be like in California, Sailor, do you think? I hear it don't rain much there.
They sure do stink.
Okay, manslaughterer who's broke his parole and got in mind nothin' but immoral purposes far's you're concerned.
Almost. I figure we should find us a place to stay and then go eat.
I H-A-T-E hotel bedspreads. They don't hardly never get washed, and I don't like the idea of lyin' on other people's dirt.
Heard on the radio how doctors is usin' leeches again, just in old times. You know, when even barbers used 'em?
Yeah, well listen to this... Radio said back in the 1920s a I-talian doctor figured out that if, say, a fella got his nose cut off or bit off in, say, a barfight or somethin', they'd sew one of his forearms to his nose for a few weeks... Then put leeches on it.
Sailor Ripley! You stop! You're makin' this shit up and I ain't gonna sit for it!
I love it when your eyes get wild, honey. They light up all blue almost and little white parachutes pop out of 'em. Oh, Sailor you're so aware of what goes on with me? I mean, you pay attention. And I swear, you got the sweetest cock. Sometimes it's like it's talkin' to me when you're inside? Like it's got a voice all it's own. You get right on me.
What's that, peanut?
Huh?
My God,  it better be, darlin', cause it'd be the last... What time is it?
Talkin's good. Long as you got the other? I'm a big believer in talkin', case you ain't noticed.
You think so, baby? Does my talkin' bother you, honey?
Who do?
I ain't so sure it's a great idea, but that's up to you. Just don't tell her where we are.
I was just wastin' time, peanut, till you come back.
You want to stick around here, Sailor? See if we can get some work?
The world's gettin' worse, I think, Sailor. And it don't sound like there's much we can do about it, neither.
You're scarin' me, baby.
You knew my daddy?
There's worse places, honey.
We'll be alright, peanut, long as we've got room to move.
And no AC.
Really, Sailor, it ain't nothin' against you. I love you.
You must be my son.
Really, Sail, I'll be okay.
The reptiles were supposed to be of a docile species, said a senior government official, but it seems the breeders bungled and reared attack crocodiles.
I'm fine, mama. I just wanted to tell you not to worry.
Need me for what, mama? I'm perfectly fine, and safe, too.
Six.
Take care of him?
Get rid of him?
Well, like kill him with the atomic bomb?
Shoot him? Like with a gun?
Where?
Shoot Sailor in the head with a gun... Now I'm beginning to get it... You want me to shoot Sailor in the head with a gun.
But where in the head? Not the chin, I hope.
You give me your permission to kill Johnnie Farragut.
So maybe one night you got a little too close to the fire... And you're gonna get burned, baby... And besides that, you're shit... D'you think I'd let my little girl go with shit like you?... Why, you belong right here in one of these toilets.
Does that girlfriend of yours know that her mama and Santos killed her daddy?  Does she know her own daddy was one of the biggest drug dealers around - till he started snortin' the shit himself?...  Does she know you was around that night her daddy was set fire to?
I like what you've done with it. When's Captain Nemo moving in?
Oh, well, that's just it. She's been coming down here, every half hour or so, to, sort of, check on me. If I'm not here, she might... call the police or... something.
No offense, Professor Tripp, but you look sorta crappy.
Tripp!
You didn't actually purchase this car, did you. Trip??
I thought you were Mrs. Gaskell's hobby, Tripp.
I'm sure. Where is everyone?
Well, I'm going to read it anyway.
Groom. Named Claudell. And his mother blames Vernon for his death.
You stay there.
Kidnapped? By who?
I've been doing this a long time, Tripp. I feel this kid in my bones.
So tell me about you and the Chancellor.
Oh, come on, Tripp. Cut the kid some slack.
Oh! Huh. Exactly how do we do that?
Let me get this straight. Jerry Nathan owes you money. So, as collateral, he gives you his car.
So whose car is it?
Such as.
Uh huh. So. We find Vernon, we find the car. We find the car...
Christ, Tripp. How did you know?
Naturally you have copies.
Came to my senses.
Me? What can I do?
How are you -- is it Joe?
I'll be... somewhere else.
I've been doing that a lot lately.
Is that in my chart?
Who's got a gun?
Hey, Vernon. Can I ask you a question?
Right. Well, thanks. For the lift.
Yes. But that's not why I called...
Trust me, I understand. I just want to say something to you, Grady.
It's just... for good luck. Some people carry rabbits' feet...
Really? That's remarkable.
James.  Don't leave just yet. There's something I think you ought to see.
They're glass. The buttons.
Pretty good. I'm friends with Dr. Gaskell, too.
Do you have a mirror? It's the best way to see if someone's breathing.
Can I ask you something about her?
Oh. So. Is -- is your friend Crabtree -- is he -- gay?
This is so embarrassing! You guys had to carry me out.
Mmhmmm... knap... sap...
Want me to get that?
The guy on the phone.
He wanted to know if a Grady Tripp lived here and drove a dark maroon 1966 Ford Galaxie 500 with black interior.
Afraid so.
I think it's sort of writing itself at this point.
Professor Tripp?
A couple weeks. That's why... that's why I had the gun. For protection.
I can't help myself. I don't know what's the matter with me.
It's a hellhole. Three motels and a mannequin factory. My dad worked there for thirty-five years.
I thought you were the guy who didn't like to lose control of his emotions.
Jesus...  Look, James, you appear to possess -- like many an aspiring writer before you, by the way -- a rather ardent affinity for the stuff of which dreams are made. However, I think it's best if, for the moment at least  ...we abstain.
It's warm.
That's why you're having them. Your spells.
I'm not going with them.
Near Carvel?
And we both thank you for that, but we're... we're... fine.
Does she mean -- does she know about... her dog?
I'm a little worried, James.
Yes, Hannah?
Me? Sure. Why?
He's going with me. You take Crabtree. And his friend. All right?
James. This is my editor, Terry Crabtree.
That strikes me as odd.
His bag. You know that ratty green thing he's always carrying around. He must've left it inside.
All right. Take him to my place. He can crash on the sofa.
Crabtree? He doesn't even know James.
But where? I need the street.
He cribbed that from Borges.
Right. Anyway, I was wondering if I could borrow your car. Mine's sort of out of commission.
Professor Tripp.
I need to talk to you.
I don't believe I know where the upstairs guest room is.
Has he asked to see the book yet?
No, really, Sara, I don't think you --
I don't think I really have a choice in, that. Emily left me.
Who's gun is that?
Pow.
I believe you. I believe you want to be with me. But this is not just about me anymore.
No, I don't think you do. And besides... I haven't decided yet.
Oh?
Honestly. Someone stole my car. I parked it right there last night.
I guess you have to go on faith.
That perfume you're wearing, Antonia. It wouldn't happen to be Cristaile, would it?
That's nice. All we have is a Japanese beetle trap.
Is it good?
Listen, Hank, I'm sorry about all this. I didn't come here to upset you and Irene. I want you to know that.
One other thing. About this kid, this student of yours -- Leer -- James Leer. You wouldn't know how I could get in touch with him, would you?
Are you riding with me, James?
Pier Angeli, 1971 or '72, also pills. Charles Boyer, 1978, pills again. Charles Butterworth, 1946, I think. In a car. Supposedly it was an accident, but, you know...  He was distraught. Dorothy Dandridge, she took pills in, like, 1965. Albert Dekker, 1968, he hung himself. He wrote his suicide note in lipstick on his stomach. Alan Ladd, '64, more pills, Carole Landis, pills again, I forget when. George Reeves, Superman on TV, shot himself. Jean Seberg, pills of course, 1979. Everett Sioane -- he was good -- pills. Margaret Sullavan, pills, Lupe Velez, a lot of pills. Gig Young. He shot himself and his wife in 1978. There are more but I don't know if you would have heard of them. Ross Alexander? Clara Blandick? Maggie McNamara? Gia Scaia?
I could swear I had a '63 Chateau Latour in here. You haven't seen it, have you?
Well, Q certainly will. And, given that he will be addressing 500 people in little over an hour...
Living across the street from a grade school. Jesus.
I don't know. She won't talk about it.
I remember when they all referred to me as "the little spic poor Annette married." Except her brother. You treated me with respect.  Look, you paid your dues. Your slate is clean now.
She'll be twelve next week. We're throwing a big party on Saturday. Wish I could ask you to come...
She was going to throw it out, wasn't she? Just toss it like a scrap of wood.
What's happening?
Aren't you glad?
Anna will be away at camp. The house will be quiet. It's better when it's quiet.
C'mon, Walter.
They're extremely aggressive birds. Plus, their habits are rather filthy.
You always carry these?
A solitary vireo. I like that one.
I'd love to hear it.
My daddy likes me home before dark.
Don't you have friends?
Hiya, Walter.
I would.
Sure they do. But outside they've got trees around them. The trees shade them from the sun. Of course, the plants enrich the soil around the trees. One of nature's symbiotic relationships.
This one guy on death row, who I'll call Henry, told me about his last victim. Henry says how he's in the bedroom of a seven-year-old cutie named Adele. Her mother's in the living room watching TV. She's got the volume on so damn high he can hear David Letterman's jokes. Henry puts his hand over Adele's mouth and says, "If you scream, little girl, I'll kill your mother." And of course little Adele doesn't scream, doesn't cry, doesn't make a sound. Then he takes her hand and out they go through the front door.  Ten days later they find Adele's body. Or what's left of it.  You believe in fairy tales?
You don't know?
A man was badly beaten across the street. You know anything about that?
I didn't say what time the assault occurred.
The assault took place at approximately seven thirty.
He I.D.'d the assailant. The description matches you pretty well.
What's with the boxes?
I'd say you're moving.
You don't want to know, but he's damaged goods -- real damaged goods, if you know what I mean.
Yeah, like the bird.
Walter.
A long time ago, I was sent far away. When they let me come back, all my friends were gone.
I know a place in the park where only very small birds go. There are no people or dogs or ugly crows and pigeons. It's quiet except for the song of these tiny sparrowlike birds. Would you like me to take you there?
My daddy lets me sit on his lap.
Yes.
What's her name?
Tell Ms. Kramer what your daddy does.
You said you couldn't make the sound of a solitary vireo. But you did. Beautifully. I heard you.
How do you know?
I don't want to hurt my daddy.
And how's your job?
Walter, I'd like you to try something for me.
I thought a journal would encourage you to reflect.
That's right.
Try it.
Because if you did, I know a therapist named Ryan. I also know a therapist named Chung.
Why do you think you're here?
Then how do you know if your patients are getting better?
Fuck you, Rosen!
You don't know!
I don't know.
You know that if anything happens, I spend the rest of my life in prison. No parole, no nothing.
Of course it is! That's why I'm telling you!
Walter, we'll pick up here next time.
We'll talk about it more on Thursday.
Go home, Walter.
No, I am not going to --
No. When I say the word "pretty," when I say the word "pleasure," what is the earliest memory you see?
Where?
I don't like nobody behind my back!
All right. A small house... with small rooms.
It's going to take time, Walter.
Here's this nice, hard working guy who suddenly appears out of the blue and rides the bus to and from work. I mean, who rides the bus anymore?
I thought you were just shy, but now I think it's something else.
I didn't say I didn't enjoy it.
Tell me about it.
So, what did you do?
Get your kicks somewhere else.
You don't molest little girls anymore, do you?
What was prison like?
I'm sorry, Walter.
I've changed.
They seduce you?
For men like me. They say most of us end up back... there. I'm saying there are risks... seeing me.
I got poked around... here and there.
I love my brothers.
You're scared.
It's a bad idea.
Thank you.
What's going on?
Goddamnit!  D'you tell him we need it right now?
Right through the brainpan.  Deader'n dogshit, boss.
Doesn't mean you had to marry her.
She went front-office on you.  Tighten that for me, right there.  That's it.
Bud!  Hippy's on the bitch-box.  It's a call from topside.  That new company man.
Okay so far.
Where are we?
Deep and slow, big guy.  Deep and slow.  Just breathe easy.
I'm taking you back out.
Okay, Jammer.  No problem.  You stay right here. I have to go there to the end... you'll see my lights.  We'll stay in voice contact.  Just hold onto the rope.  Five more minutes.  Okay?
I can't believe you let them do this!
You never did like being called that, did you?
I haven't worn mine in months.
All I'm saying is when you're hanging on by your fingernails, you don't go waving you arms around.
You totaled it, huh?
It's flooding like a son of the bitch.
Hi, tough guy.  I guess it worked, huh?
Hello, Brigman.
Hey, you come on my rig, you don't talk to me, you start ordering my guys around.  It won't work.  You gotta know how to handle these people... we have a certain way of doing things here.
Did you find Wilhite?
Just get around so your lights are on the hatch.
Lins, stay away from that guy.  I mean it.
Go to the infirmary... get the cart .. oxygen... de-fib kit... adrenaline in a... ten cc syringe... and some... heating blankets. You got all that?
Is that it?  Is this right?
You better not say you missed that.
Hippy, you pussy.
That thing was probably their version of Big Geek... like an ROV.
Get comfortable.  The bad news is we got six hours in this can, blowing down.  The worse news is it's gonna take us three weeks to decompress back to the surface later.
Look, we've all made chamber runs to this depth. We're checked out.
Copy that, continuing forward.  You just want me to get shots of everything, right?
24 Trident missiles.  Eight MIRVs per missile.
I want 'round-the-clock manning of the sonar shack and the exterior cameras.  We need early warning if the Soviet craft try another incursion.
1840... 50... 60... 70...
No.  Just you and me.  We get some proof, then tell them.  Hippy, look... if was can prove to Coffey it's not Russians, maybe he'll ease off the button a little.
Hey!
Getting a reading?
Then how come you're not with him?
Sandro... A month is too long a time. I have become used to being without you.
You know, I could just as well go without seeing him today.
Which one shall I wear?
And have you any other truths to tell me?
Up until now, Dad, I've been the one who hasn't wanted to marry him.
It's already two hours... What are we going to do?
It couldn't have come from anywhere else. At least, somewhere from that vicinity... But I really can't understand it. Contraband cigarettes on that island! It's the first time that ever happened.
Say, Claudia, wouldn't you like to climb up with me and take a look over there?
Well?
Are you feeling better?
I think that you might go and have a look yourself.
Sandro, I don't want you to come with me, I don't want to see you... How can I make it clear to you?...Why did you come?
Claudia, let's get married?
Yes. We'll get married. You and I. What do you say?
And you leave me here all alone... in this hotel room...
Sandro ...What's the matter?
No, Sandro... Please...
Sandro, wait a moment, just one moment... You seem like an entirely different person ...
No, Sandro... We should go. Besides, we haven't been in touch with anybody. Not even with Anna's father. We should have at least sent a wire or telephoned... let's be fair, he must be feeling awfully lonely.
Sandro, listen... Try not to get yourself too involved tomorrow.
Sandro, I'm not coming down.
He amuses me. I don't know of anything more amusing. Outside of this jigsaw puzzle. Don't you find it so, Claudia?
Now, listen. For God's sake, try not to let yourself become obsessed with that idea. Go to your room and get back into bed.
You should never wish to get melodramatic over anything.
It's as smooth and slick as oil.
But for what reason would she have wanted to go away?
Ettore...
Let's see you dive from the top of those rocks, Giulia. That would be really sensational.  Come on, Giulia ... your life is much too circumscribed.
You men are all so dreadful!
Oh, there are as many as one wants.
Don't you ever paint men?
They tell me you have a lot of trouble at home. Is that right?
What other boat?
Are you the owner of this place?
Whose boat is that?
We've decided to go to Montaldo's place. In fact, Ettore should already be there.
You should have told Ettore. He always manages to get what he wants.
Why have we stopped?
Agnes, it has come to my attention that you have stopped eating. Why is this? AGNES  I've been commanded by God.
No.
No.
Because...
Christ said it in the Bible, he said - suffer the little children, I want to suffer like a little child.
Mommy I'll get bigger and bigger every day and then I'll pop but... but if I stay little it won't happen.
It made them uncomfortable. And if they didn't sleep well I'm certain the next day they were cranky as mules. Sister where are your sheets?  Do you really believe that sleeping on a bare mattress is the equivalent of sleeping in a coffin?
Then tell me. Where are your sheets?
A few years ago one of the Sisters came to me in tears, asking for comfort, comfort because she was too old to have any children. Not that she wanted to, but once a month she had been reminded of that possibility.
For what?
Agnes, have you ever loved another man... other than, Jesus Christ?
Do you think he loves you?
Yes.
No, they say it came from the waste paper basket!
What do you mean?
No wonder... wait... Agnes... Agnes how do you feel about babies?
I don't understand them either. Do you suppose I was dropped on my head?
What happens if the bell rings and you're under there?
What things?
How did she know that?
Did your mother see angels often?
If you did want one, how'd you go about getting one?
Agnes, I don't believe you know nothing about sex...
... and that you don't believe you carried a child.
She's dead isn't she?
Yes?
How does she know that?
Oh, yes.
Oh Agnes, oh Agnes, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, I love you.
And why am I here?
Good. Would you like to tell me why you're here?
Did you know what was going to come out?
No not yet Agnes, very soon but not yet. How did the baby get into you?
Would you like to tell me?
Hm hmm.
Who?
For me to get sick in.
Which one?
Yes.
So I could go to him.
I hate him...
I've been watching. We were fine 'till she came. She brought the devil here.  There was blood on her hand that night.
Martha, you have to make a decision on her sanity as quickly as possible and not interfere with due process of law.
Larry...
Martha, it's you.
Oh Joe... Joe she didn't kill the baby.
Did you have a good week Mama. Are they treating you all right?
The convent was built for over fifty. Not many of us left... just us and the chickens.
Oh, we own the land around here. But we rent it out. We keep a few acres for ourselves,  some wheat, corn, some vegetables.
Oh that one there, in the corner.
Yes.
How did she hide it from the other nuns?
What man had access to her?
What's his name?
Could there have been anyone else?
And you didn't try to find out who?
She can't even remember the birth. Do you think she'd admit to the conception?
Look doctor, I don't know how to tell you this politely, but I don't approve of you. Not you personally...
Exactly. I want you do deal with Agnes as speedily and as easily as possible. She won't hold up under any sort of cross examination.
Well... what do you think?  Is she totally bananas or merely slightly off centre... or maybe she's perfectly sane and just a very good liar.
I believe Agnes is different.
She didn't!  This is manslaughter, not murder. She didn't consciously kill that baby. She'd lost a lot of blood. She was unconscious by the time we got to her.
I've already told you what I thought.
Oh come on, you've talked to her. She doesn't even know how babies are born, let alone made.
I was appalled, just as you are now.
Why didn't you take her to a doctor?
You hate us don't you?
I'm only interested...
She is not a child.
What?
Do you have a... a diary or a day book?
Oh, Dear God...
When was that?
No, it just makes you doubly responsible doesn't it?
An unhappy woman...
Fine thanks...
Undoubtedly. Not the ascetics of course but, well Saint Thomas More...
Saint Ignatius would smoke cigars and stub them out on the soles of his bare feet.  And of course 
Pipe!
Right.  What do you suppose today's saints are smoking?
Do you want to become one?
I've just met with the bishop. We're taking you off the case.
For Agnes.
The father!
Why must he be anybody?
Oh, would you stop lying Mother!
Was it you?
You wanted that child out of the way.
You hid the wastepaper basket in her room.
And the baby.
Before or after you killed the child?
Yeah, I've blown school out.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Shurrup!
Can you fix him for me?
All right, all right. If you don't need this lot, I'll lock 'em up in the dressing room till you do.
Leave them drums alone.
That's right retreat behind a smoke screen of bourgeois cliches. I don't go round messing about with your ear-phones, do I?
Yeah, you know, "O.K. Buster, follow that car, there's a sawbuck in it for you if you get real close!"
We want you to give us your opinion on some clothes for teenagers.
Now, you'll like these. You really "dig" them. They're "fab" and all the other pimply hyperboles.
Get him out of here!!
That's not your Grandfather.
You see, he was going to get married but she threw him over for a butcher.
Gerron.
Did you look in here?
Yes, he's filled his head with notions seemingly.
I don't think that bit's right.
How'd you like a dirty great drum roll giving you a clout right in the middle of your solo?
What are we waiting for?
Hello, he's not talking to me. He's having a sulk.
You're from Liverpool, aren't you?
What are you?
Ah.
Any old where ... but not our little Richard ... oh no! When you're not thumping them pagan skins, you're tormenting your eyes wid that rubbish!
I'm soldier of the Republic, you'll need the mahogany truncheon for this boyo. A nation once again.
Hello, Grandfather!
Come on let's get this coffee.
That's right; convict without trial ... Habeas corpus.
Oh, it's all right for you but those two girls were scared to death! Honest, Grandad, why? I mean, why do you do these things?
Well, don't be daft, I've got to.
Anything to spare?
Is that yours?
What are you doing there?
Aye and fond of fresh meat and all.
You won't interfere with the basic rugged concept of my personality, will you, girl?
What's he know?
We've got only half an hour till the final run-through. He can't walk out on us.
Y'what?
Are you listening to me, Lennon?
If you're going to have a barney I'll hold your coats.
Paul, John, George - get at it.
I'll brook no denial!
Now get on with it.
The office was on the phone, they think it'd be better if we pushed straight to Wolverhampton.
Oh, wait a minute, don't tell me you're ...
Oh you are, I know you are.
Mind you, I stood up for you, I mean I wouldn't have it.
Stop picking on him.
What do you think are you're up to?
Look after him.
Do I have to raise me voice?
Well, you stick to that story, son.
Eh. I thought you were looking after the old man.
Put it this way, he's mislaid him.
Eh, what's all this?
What is he?
Locked.
It's... basalt.  Rock.
Are you okay in there?
Hell, you're in great shape, you've got your sense of humor back!
Unknown!  What do you mean?
How long to fix?
<u>He</u> died.
Yes?  What is it?
Why, what's wrong?
We could cut a section out of that metallite netting.  It won't hold up to that acid, but aside from that it's pretty strong.
Where's it coming from?
What happened?  Where's Sandy?
Oh -- God -- oh --
Jay... how's it coming on the repairs?
It's really on there tight.
Oh it's okay.  I've had better cag than this, but I've had worse too, if you know what I mean.
So does anybody have any suggestions?
Where did it come from?
Blood's thoroughly oxygenated.
We don't know what might happen if we tried to kill it.  At least right now it's keeping him alive.
God, that smoke's poisonous!
It makes me sick to see him like that.
It's a crude symbolic language -- looks primitive.
I'll do it.  The rest of you continue.
I think I could cobble something together.  A long metal rod with a battery in it.  Give it a hell of a shock.
While the rest of us wait down in the cooling unit with the net.
We'd better seal off the lower maintenance level; at least trap it there. 
Listen, it sure didn't like this flamethrower.
Oh no!  We can't fight this thing! There's only six hours of air left -- we're dead men!
If we could just get the <u>creature</u> into the lifeboat, we could launch it into space and blow it up.
Now what's wrong?
Can you get them back?
Well... I suppose that star-shaped thing could be the parasite that got on Broussard.  Is that what you mean?
Sandy, you want to give us some vision?
What's wrong?
What'd he say?
It's not coming off -- not without his whole face coming off too.
We're just plain lucky.  That could have gone right through the hull -- taken <u>weeks</u> to patch it.
I thought I'd find you here.
I can see you're putting your spare time to good use.  Let me tell you something: you keep staring at hyperspace for long enough, they'll be peeling you off a wall.  I've seen it happen.
I've got Hunter... and something else as well, in front of him.
They're on the next level up.
Source of transmission is to the northeast... about 300 meters.
It appears to be a heavy fluid of some sort... it blocks the X-rays...
First thing I'm going to do when we get back is eat some biological food.
It's out of focus.
Atmospheric turbulence.  Dust storm.
Yeah, okay. 
But?
Look at these suckers -- no wonder we couldn't get it off him.
I'm sorry to say it looks like you were right in the first place, Martin.  We never should have landed here.
Take us up.
We made it!  Damn, we made it!
That's the part that always makes me feel like I'm gonna puke -- when we accelerate into light speed.
What's it doing, having a seizure?
Hey, wait a minute!  That's all our food supplies in there!  We can't pump poison gas all over them!
This stuff's deadly -- I hope we know what we're doing.
Can you make out any pattern in all that?
That'll blow the ship up.
No, it won't work and I just realized why.  There's only one hypersleep freezer on the lifeboat. Only one of us could survive.
All right, Martin, we'll be in touch with you on the communicator.
Nada. No radiation... no movement... nothing.
Yeah, it's fine.
Minh...
Can you patch me a temporary loop on DCMGS?
Drains right into the Central Reservoir.
Fucking great.  I invested some money in them.
Picking up velocity.
Ah, quit griping.  Keeps you in shape doesn't it?
Whoa, wait a minute...
Wait.  Lost it.
Is it still moving?
Nobody wander off on their own until it's found.  Keep in pairs. Diller, once the first team's done their sweep I want you to go down with Annie to Three-Pump while she replaces it.
She was running a little sluggish on the way back.  Think the turbines might be playing up.
That's what we thought.
Fort Powell.  What do we tell 'em?
It's not all good news.  We had to take off the helmet lights.  You'll be going in blind.
There's still time to back-out.
Okay, we're in business.
I've got a lot of thinking to do.  'Sides, the room was getting too crowded for me.
Any luck raising Ackland's party?
Yeah.  Somebody won.
Do you believe him?
That's the wrong way!
Where'd you leave them?
Nah, I'll stick it out for another hour or so.
I expected to find this little room overcrowded, with a theater full of people at your feet...
A revolutionary approach to the Theater. However, if I may a suggestion...
- perhaps more than one. There's so much I want to know. I've heard your story in bits and pieces... your home in Wisconsin, your tragic marriage, your financial attachment to Margo - it started in San Francisco, didn't it?  I say - your idolatry of Margo started in San Francisco, didn't it?
San Francisco. An oasis of civilization in the California desert. Tell me, do you share my high opinion of San Francisco?
A fine old theater, the Shubert. Full of tradition, untouched by the earthquake - so sorry - fire... by the way, what was your husband's name?
I confide in you and rely on you more than anyone I've ever known! To say a thing like that now - without any reason - when I need you more than ever...
Just like it.
What time?
We're?
I didn't mean just the Theater.
Was the setting properly romantic - the lights on dimmers, gypsy violins off stage?
Look closely, Eve, it's time you did. I am Addison deWitt. I'm nobody's fool. Least of all - yours.
I still don't know what you're getting at. Right now I want to take my nap. It's important that I-
You're too short for that gesture. Besides, it went out with Mrs. Fiske.
She was a liar, she was a liar!
That's not true!
And you realize - you agree how completely you belong to me?
I don't think I'm going.
Because I don't want to.
Every now and then, some elder statesman of the Theater or cinema assures the public that actors and actresses are just plain folk. Ignoring the fact that their greatest attraction to the public is their complete lack of resemblance to normal human beings.
Claudia dear, come closer.  This is Max Fabian. He is a producer. Go do yourself some good.
I'm giving her a very high-class party. It ain't like a rehearsal, she don't have to be late.
From the smartness of your dress, I take it your luncheon companion is a lady?
Just slipped your mind.
In time she'll be what you are.
Bill...
You've already met.
Good luck, genius...
The lack of pretense, that sort of strange directness and understanding-
Don't get stuck on some glamour puss-
I leave in a week - the picture's all wrapped up, we previewed last night... those previews. Like opening out of town, but terrifying. There's nothing you can do, you're trapped, you're in a tin can-
You in a hurry?
Of course, birthday and welcome home... who'll I ask?
She did...?
Yeah... I will.
Need any help?
Looks like I'm going to have a very fancy party...
Thirty minutes, forty minutes! What of it?
For instance what?
Mad! Darling, there are certain characteristics for which you are famous - on stage and off. I love you for some of them - and in spite of others. I haven't let those become too important to me. They're part of your equipment for getting along in what is laughably called out environment - you've got to keep your teeth sharp. All right. But you will not sharpen them on me - or on Eve...
- shows up for an audition when everyone knew I'd be here... and gives a performance! Out of nowhere - gives a performance!
Paranoiac!
I - I don't know, Bill. Just a feeling, I don't know...
But you may quote me as follows. Quote. Tonight Miss Margo Channing gave a performance in your cockamamie play, the like of which I have never seen before and expect rarely to see again. Unquote.
There goes Eve. Eve evil, Little Miss Evil. But the evil that men do - how does it go, groom? Something about the good they leave behind - I played it once in rep in Wilkes Barre...
Never try to outguess Margo.
A cowboy.
Hello, what's your name?
Why what?
The Theatuh, the Theatuh-  - what book of rules says the Theater exists only within some ugly buildings crowded into one square mile of New York City? Or London, Paris or Vienna?  Listen, junior. And learn. Want to know what the Theater is? A flea circus. Also opera. Also rodeos, carnivals, ballets, Indian tribal dances, Punch and Judy, a one-man band - all Theater. Wherever there's magic and make-believe and an audience - there's Theater. Donald Duck, Ibsen, and The Lone Ranger, Sarah Bernhardt, Poodles Hanneford, Lunt and Fontanne, Betty Grable, Rex and Wild, and Eleanora Duse. You don't understand them all, you don't like them all, why should you? The Theater's for everybody - you included, but not exclusively - so don't approve or disapprove. It may not be your Theater, but it's Theater of somebody, somewhere.
I think we'd like very much. Sure you won't mind?
Thanks for your help... good luck.
I'm talking about you. And what you want.
You're always after truth - on the stage. What about off?
When you told me that whatever I became, it would be because of you-
You need new girdles.
There are some human experiences, Birdie, that do not take place in a vaudeville house - and that even a fifth-rate vaudevillian should understand and respect!  I want to apologize for Birdie's-
She's loyal and efficient-
That's all.
The maid'll fix it in the morning.
How'd you get all the way up here from Brooklyn?
It's after one now. You won't get home till all hours.
Why should you be? After all, six nights a week - for weeks - of watching even Margo Channing enter and leave a theater-
There isn't another like you, there couldn't be-
You look just fine...  ... by the way. What's your name?
Eve... why don't you start at the beginning?
Good night, Eve. I hope I see you again soon-
Now who's show up at this hour? It's time people went home - hold that coat up...  ... whose is it?
Discouraging, isn't it? Women with furs like that where it never gets cold...
There should be a new word for happiness. Being here with Miss Channing has been - I just can't say, she's been so wonderful, done so much for me-
Mrs. Richards.
I don't expect you to be pleasant.
Oh, but there is-
He can help you.
Yes, you will. You Theater people always do. Nothing is forever in the Theater. Love or hate, success or failure - whatever it is, it's here, it flares up and burns hot - and then it's gone.
During your second act scene with your father, Roger Ferraday's supposed to stay way upstage at the arch. He's been coming closer down every night...
Right here.
Would you like a drink? It's right beside you...
How much time have we?
He's in love with you.
Margo. Bill is all of eight years younger than you.
I don't suppose the heater runs when the motor doesn't?
It get better! "- About the understandable reluctance on the part of our entrenched First Ladies of the Stage to encourage, shall we say - younger - actresses; about Miss Harrington's own long and unsupported struggle for opportunity-"
How was the concert?
- 'at's my loyal little woman.
That's on time for Margo.
- don't run out of adjectives, dear.
Margo hasn't done badly by it.
- it's Addison, from start to finish, it drips with his brand of venom... taking advantage of a kid like that, twisting her words, making her say what he wanted her to say-
Eve.
She wanted to explain about her interview, wanted to apologize to someone - and didn't dare face Margo...
Darling, I didn't promise Eve anything. Just said I thought she'd be fine for the part, but there were some practical difficulties...
You mean - all this time - she'd done nothing but apologize? What'd you say?
Honey chili had a point. You know, I can remember plays about women - even from the South - where it never even occurred to them whether they wanted to marry their fathers more than their brothers...
How about calling it a night?
The general atmosphere is very Macbethish. What has or is about to happen?
There you are, both of you. Max, Karen has decided it's time to go.
Miss Channing is ageless. Spoken like a press agent.
Spoken like an author.  Lloyd, I'm not twentyish. I am not thirtyish. Three months ago, I was forty years old. Forty. Four oh.  That slipped out, I hadn't quite made up my mind to admit it. Now I feel as if I'd suddenly taken all my clothes off...
You have a genius for making barroom brawl out of a perfectly innocent misunderstanding at most!
Yes, sir.
Very discreet. A note right out in the open like that. Next time tell your lover to blow smoke rings - or tap a glass...
I don't think I could be.
Now wait a minute, you're always so touchy about his plays, it isn't the part - it's a great part. And a fine play. But not for me anymore - not a foursquare, upright, downright, forthright married lady.
Margo. You by any chance got bicarbonate of soda in the house?
Here you are, Maxie dear. One good burp and you'll be rid of that Miss Caswell...
When's the audition?
I tell you what. Why don't I read with her?
You get quick action, don't you?
Are you breaking the contract?
--it was fine the way it was--
--I'm smart enough to know my story was solid--
--no way--
What is it about my writing that's so rotten?
Carl?
And McCord was carrying an application for college press credentials for the Democratic convention.  The Times has got to be full of it-- it can't be crazy Cubans.
You think they are confidential? I don't know anything about how this town works, I haven't lived here a year yet.
That was fun.  What now?
--I'm trying--
Who's first?
It's not us, they were scared before we got there.  What do we know?
And that something's got to be more than just Hunt, Liddy, and the five burglars--those indictments are gonna be bullshit when they come down. What else do we know?
We understand your problem--
I hate both parties.
Republican?
Did he just say what I think he said?
--almost every source we've used has been Republican, this guy's a card- carrying Democrat.
--because a year before, the Republicans weren't ahead, not in the polls, Muskie was running ahead of Nixon then. Before he self- destructed.
California, Illinois, Florida, New Hampshire--all the major Democratic primary states.  Why does everything you play sound the same?
--That cash fund that financed the sabotaging of the Democrats--five guys had control--
I wish we were investigating Attila the Hun.
--Sloan told the Grand Jury--he answered everything they asked him-- that means there's a record somewhere--
I know a guy in the Justice Department who was around the Grand Jury. 
--jeeeeeeeeesus--
I never could figure just who this Dahlberg was.  Think it might be anything?
None of it was my idea, Carl--I didn't go looking for the job.
I don't know anything about Haldeman, except, Dwight's frightened of him-- everybody's frightened of him--Christ, I wish I'd never gotten messed around with this--all I wanna do is sit in the sun; sit, swim, see some girls.
--you got more than one source?--
--it would have been nice to have had this, I sure would have liked to have had this--
--Bernstein, are you sure on this story?
Hannah, I never would have bothered you but I'm off to Miami and they're gonna take away my ten speed unless I get it straightened out fast.
I think.
If you don't like it down there, why don't you quit?
Gordon Liddy, you mean?
Something maybe big.
That's another of the things I'm not so sure of.
Ordinarily, though, what was the procedure?
I really can't talk now--
--that leaves Haldeman, period.
--I don't know, I don't know, it feels thin--
Sorry, Ken; listen, one last thing: where did your talk with Berger happen?
Well, was it in a bar, her apartment, some restaurant--
I don't know; I really don't. The last time I saw it was when I was in Washington. I gave it to the Finance department of the Committee to Re- Elect the President. How it got to that burglar, your guess is as good as mine.
You thought I'd help out on specifics?  I'll confirm what you get, try to keep you on the right track, but that's all.  Are you guys really working?  How much?
Follow the money. Always follow the money.
--melodramatic?  Things are past that--remember, these are men with switchblade mentalities who run the world as if it were Dodge City.
My turn to keep you waiting.  What's the topic for tonight?
They know, but they focused on the burglary--if it didn't deal with the break-in, they didn't pursue it.
Someone with authority I'd imagine, wouldn't you?  Don't you know what you're onto? Come on.
Why did they do all this for Chrissakes?--what were they after?
Fifty ratfuckers directed by the White House to destroy the Democrats?
Hi, I'm Bob Woodward of the Post and--
Where?
Never? Please don't tell me never.  Ben says you've found some wonderful sources.
--you are ignoring the importance of the Dahlberg repercussions--
--correction--when you were drinking your lunch at the bar of the Sans Souci--
--absolutely--and that's all they do, sit sit sit--every once in a while, they call up a Senator, some reporting--
As usual, that keen mind of yours has pegged the situation perfectly.  Except  it wasn't local Democratic Headquarters, it was National Democratic Headquarters--  --and  these weren't just any idiots, these were special idiots, seeing as when they were arrested at 2:30 this morning, they were all wearing business suits and Playtex gloves and were carrying--  --a walkie-talkie, forty rolls of film, cameras, lock picks, pen-sized tear gas guns, plus various bugging devices.  Not to mention over two thousand dollars, mostly in sequenced hundred dollar bills.
What'd you get on W.House?
That was awhile ago.
--listen, we didn't make them do these things--once they did, it's our job to report it--
Isn't that what you'd expect them to say?
--which Young?
I'd like to talk to you, I really would, but my lawyers say I shouldn't until after the Watergate trial.
I can't say anything, I'm sorry. 
Hi. I'm Bob Woodward of the Washington Post and I hate to bother you at home--
What the hell was that?
You're a killer, Ozzy!
Uh...you know, my friends call me Nova -- as in Casanova.
Look, Chris.  There are just some things you need to learn, that's all.
You have to pay attention to a girl. Be sensitive to her feelings. Relationships are reciprocal.
What are we gonna hear?
You know, Jim...you could go back there...and...
Just go!
I'll tell you, I've learned one thing: women, like wine, get better with age.  Of course, I have no frame of reference for this comparison.
Oh sure.  I know what people think. It's like, Oz, he's just this kickass lacrosse player -- I also play football, by the way -- But that's like...not <u>all</u> that I am.
I just -- realized that I didn't know anything about you.  I was interested.
Um...Chris --
What?!
Why are you doing this?
Hi...
So you're going to Michigan?
Well, I mean, business is okay, and lacrosse is awesome, but what am I gonna be, a pro lacrosse player?  I really have no idea.
Vanderbilt's not that far from U of M.
Jessica!  He'll drive there for me, and I'll drive to Ann Arbor for him. We're going to have sex when he's ready and I'm ready.  It's got to be completely perfect.  I want the right place, the right time, the right moment.
No comment.
Well...I guess it's okay for me to tell you now.  That reputation of his isn't going anywhere.  Finch comes to me and says, "Jessica, I need help with this, blah blah, etcetera."  So I told him, pay me two- hundred bucks, and I'll tell a couple girls that you're dynamite in bed.  So he did, and I did.
Oooh, yeah.  Oh, baby, you're so good.
Give it to me!  Yes!
There's our man.
At least now I know what the hell they're saying.
That's what we are, we keep each other on track.  Prior to this day, we've postured.  We've procrastinated. We've pretended.  We've -- well I can't think of other p-words, but we've probably done them too.
Yeah, it's like tradition or something.
You can send me the address too.
Yeah?  Well come prom night, those excuses aren't going to do you much good.
Back out?  You don't need <u>us</u> to get laid.  You afraid or something?
No, no that's fine.  So you doing okay?
What the heck is this?
Can I come in?
Okay.
Hold on.  You have no idea why I'm angry?
Yeah, that's pretty much it.
What was your name again?
Whatever you want.
That is a <u>nasty</u> story!
You guys got the Latin homework?
What's up, fellas?
Okay...that would be cool sometime.  How 'bout tomorrow?
So you need to change, right?
You mean like, <u>strip</u> strip?
Jim...
Ho-lee shit.
Kevin!  You seen Shitbreak lately?
Let me know.
You're not doing the extra credit problems.
We've come a long way since Homecoming.
Like how?
Kevin?  Do you not love me?
And I want to make things perfect for you.  You're right, Kev, we do have something good...and special.
See -- this is the nicest room.
Yeah.
Yeah Vick?
Kevin, next year...with you in Ann Arbor, and me in Nashville...it's not gonna work, is it.
You called me to ask me how to get laid?
Just dial 976-Asshole.
Have you ever heard of the bible?
Uh -- forget that.  Look, is that all you're interested in?  Ways to get your girlfriend into bed?
Hey.  I got another question for you.
And little hurly-burly came by in her curly-wurly, and asked me if I needed I ri-hide --
I put in months of quality time with Vicky.  Sherman meets a chick for one night and scores?  This is just wrong.
And by the way, Sherman didn't even get laid.
Wow.  You two really have something going, don't you?
You dipshit, you're expecting to score with some goody-goody choir-girl priss?
<u>Yeah</u>!
Hey, you know, what can I say, I dig those cute little sweaters she wears.
Our last game is this Saturday.
Really?
Look, the more you think about it, the harder it is.
Ha ha. You were probably right about his mom.
Oh fuck, you are his nephew...
Yeah. True. The cops weren't much help either. Their theory is he was moonlighting as a drug dealer or something. Make sense to you?
You must not have known him very well. He's not like that.
Professor Claude Rousel. The one your uncle was working with. He teaches cultural history.
So you came after all. Just in time, it's getting interesting.
Andy! Holy shit!
Thank God! What a relief! I thought... After you disappeared... I couldn't find you... I thought all sorts of horrible things...
What happened? Did you cut yourself?
What about your glasses?
Fixing your makeup with a phone, huh? Who the fuck are you calling?
Hello?
I don't know...
Are you crazy!?
No I.... Andy, you can't be sure.
We don't both have to die.
I know where he'll go.
Hey! You shouldn't be down there!
GET ME THE FUCK OUT OF HERE!!
Okay, what the hell are you up to?
There's something down there! A bear or something! A god damn monster! Beau coup teeth! Huge, Grande, with yellow eyes, all this hair, it killed Serafine! My God...
It's you. You should be dead in that wreck with Bazin and Racine!
Saint Severin? The church? So you know all about the ADM!  Where is it! Tell me! Tell me or else!
The ADM. Let's go.
That's not all...  Marcel - Officer Boulard was following you.
He was a good man. Now his wife is a widow.
Andy...
Not you too -
I don't believe we've been introduced.
Great. Later on we'll have to get together for cocktails. Right now I kinda have to hurry before I grow a lot of hair and eat people.  Say this heart thing works. What's it got to do with ADM?
Andy, I have to tell you about the dream I had - or that I'm still having - it feels like a systemic, physio- tropic reaction to some drug, maybe a triptamine or phenethylamine derivative. But it is hyper-real. I'd swear my legs had been cut off or... wait a second... I'm getting a strange meta-physical buzz. Shit. I'm, uh, dead, aren't I?
The ADM! Be careful, Andy. It's very powerful. How do you know about it?
Andrew Mc-dair-mo?
Jesus...
I'm afraid she's not so lucky. She's undead. And so am I.
Shit. I feel sick.
Don't give me your black magic bullshit! Seven mutilations in forty eight hours and all you find is a scrawny American boy? Do you have a motive?  Do you have a weapon? Or do you want me to believe he did it with his own two hands?
Andy, stop! I think he can help you - 
Andy!
No, it's no cure. It's something much more interesting.
Well?
Where is your home, Anya?
We have to prepare you for an audience with Sophie.
We're just going to refresh your memory...
Ouch!  That really hurt!
AND A SONG SOMEONE SINGS ONCE UPON A DECEMBER.
People say Anastasia was the only member of the Royal Family to escape alive.  That makes her an orphan too 
By pulling my hair?!
Come on!
You never said anything to me about having to prove I'm a Princess!
I know I must have had something to do with the palace - I've had little flashes of things - but being the Princess? It doesn't matter as long as I find my home.
Anya, wait!
Who are you, child?
PAR AWAY, LONG AGO GLOWING DEEP AS AN EMBER
... and that Christmas dinner, when Cook made that awful plum pudding and we hid it in our pockets so we wouldn't hurt her feelings! I do remember so much now, Grandmama, - but not everything.
Anastasia! It was just a bat! It's gone, dear...
Boy, don't you hate it when that happens?
It's her.
So where will you go?
What do you want?!
You're insane! You didn't kill the Romonovs - it was the...
I'm not Ulo and I won't slow down. But you will listen to me!
You are the boy ...
I did no such thing!
May I present her Royal Highness Princess Anastasia!
Gimme a break, will yuh, gimme a break. Jesus Christ!
It's an important issue.
Yes.
H'm, I'm sorry, I can't go through with this, because it-I can't get it off my mind, Allison... it's obsessing me!
I-I-I-I would leave out the men's- room attendant.
I-i-i-i-it's all right, fellas.  Jesus, what'd you do, come by way of the Panama Canal?
Oh, come on, we've seen it. I'm not in the mood to see a four-hour documentary on Nazis.
Stop it, Alvy!
Boy, those guys in the French Resistance were really brave, you know? Got to listen to Maurice Chevalier sing so much.
You? You kiddin'?  If the Gestapo would take away your Bloomingdale's charge card, you'd tell 'em everything.
Oh, God! Here yuh go! Oh, good, now he'll think-  Aaaah! Okay.
Great! Great!  Goddammit!  Ooooh! These are... p-p-p-pick this lobster up. Hold it, please!
Oh, come on-I mean, I was still younger.
Uh... you-you wanna lift?
No, um... I was gonna take a cab.
Right!  Where?
You want your tennis stuff?
You're the worst driver I've ever seen in my life... that's including any place... the worst... Europe, United... any place... Asia.
Well... thank you again.
Well, I mean, you don't have to, you know.
Well, didn't you take, uh... uh, a shower at the club?
But I'm thinking about getting some cats, you know, and then they... Oh, wait a second-oh, no, no, I mean  oh, shoot! No, Saturday night I'm gonna-  gonna sing. Yeah.
I was awful. I'm so ashamed! I can't sing.
No, I'm gonna quit!
Really, do you think so, really?
Nothing that a few mega-vitamins couldn't cure.
My first... Yes, she was nice, but you know, uh, it was my fault. I was just... I was too crazy.
Hey?
I-I-I'm gonna buy you these books, I think, because I-I think you should read them. You know, instead of that cat book.
big subject with me, yeah.
...you know, they're- The-the horrible would be like, uh, I don't know, terminal cases, you know?
You know, and the miserable is everyone else. That's-that's all. So- so when you go through life you should be thankful that you're miserable, because that's- You're very lucky... to be...  ...to be miserable.
You- Do you love me?
Then why are you always pushing me to take those college courses like I was dumb or something?
Uh-uh-why?
Yeah.
Well, what is your definition of following?
Yeah-well, you wanted to keep the relationship flexible, remember? It's your phrase.
And I didn't have to lie down on the couch, Alvy, she had me sitting up. So I told her about-about the-the family and about my feelings toward men and about my relationship with my brother.
Oh, I told her my dream and then I cried.
Will it change my life?
What's- It's me, open up.
That's what you got me here for at three o'clock in the morning, 'cause there's a spider in the bathroom?
Jesus. All right, gimme a magazine. I- 'cause I'm a little tired.  You know, you, you joke with-about me, you make fun of me, but I'm prepared for anything. An emergency, a tidal wave, an earthquake. Hey, what is this? What? Did you go to a rock concert?
Well, I was in be- It's three o'clock in the morning. You, uh, you got me outta bed, I ran over here, I couldn't get a taxi cab. You said it was an emergency, and I didn't ge- I ran up the stairs. Hell - I was a lot more attractive when the evening began. Look, uh, tell- Whatta you- Are you going with a right-wing rock-and- roll star? Is that possible?
Okay, let me have this.
Hey, what is this? You got black soap?
Oh, Jesus, really?
Living together hasn't been so bad, has it?
Oh, look, look, there's that... that's that's my old house. That's where we used to live.
What's... you... well, what's the matter, You w-wanna go to that party?
I'm just not... you know, I don't think I could take a mellow eve- 'cause I-I don't respond well to mellow, you know what I mean, I-I have a tendency to... if I get too mellow, I-I ripen and then rot. You know, and it's-it's not good for my... 
That day in Brooklyn was the last day I remember really having a great time.
She would not sleep with me the other night, you know, it's-
You never wanna try anything new, Alvy.
...I'm thrilled. As you know, uh... uh, on my agent's advice I sold out, and I'm gonna do an appearance on TV.
Oh, good. Okay.
It's wonderful. I mean, you know they just watch movies all day.
This "Denial of Death". You remember this?
What?
Hey, this one's mine, this button. This one, you rem-
No.  Yes, of course I'm mad, because you love me, I know that.
Alvy.
What'd I do?
Why, I was just expressing a healthy sexual curiosity.
Why couldn't you have been more like Donald?  Now, there was a model boy!
Yeah, two more chairs and they got a dining-room set.
Oh, really, I heard that Commentary and Dissent had merged and formed Dysentery.
Jesus, last night it was some guy honking his car horn. I mean, the city can't close down. You know, what-whatta yuh gonna do, h-have 'em shut down the airport, too? No more flights so we can have sex?
Are you?
I hope you don't mind that I took so long to finish.
Like all that Juliet of the Spirits or Satyricon, I found it incredibly... indulgent. You know, he really is. He's one of the most indulgent film makers. He really is-
I never read that. That was-that was Henry James, right? Novel, uh, the sequel to Turn of the Screw? My Sexual...
Yes.
Oh.
No, no, no, Max, that's a very convenient out. Every time some group disagrees with you it's because of anti-Semitism.
Right. I was a great athlete. Tell her, Max, I was the best, I was all schoolyard.
I have some very good memories there.
Right-well, Santa Claus will have sunstroke.
Twins, Max. Sixteen-year-olds. Can you imagine the mathematical possibilities?
Let 'im drop dead! Who needs his business?!
That was fun. I don't think California is bad at all. It's a drag coming home.
Well, hi!
Oh, yeah, really, oh!
Well, hey, that's, that's nice. Uh. Oh, listen, this is, uh, Alvy Singer. Do you know Alvy? Uh... and... uh... Tony Lacey.
Oh, well, I-if it's inconvenient, eh, we can't do it now... that's fine, too. W-w-w-we'll do it another time.
Just... that's all you need. You can come and stay here.
It could be freezing, it could be raining.
Did you know the contractor?
Did you see permits?  Did he have a license?
Anouk isn't like a dog, really.  More like a small person.  So is there anyone here for me?  No one looks new.  Who's that?
What's that?
Yeah, I know... But she's only twenty seven and...  The wisdom.  She's an old soul.  She knew that Shostakovich thing.  Did you notice?
Yeah, God she really does have great tits, great tits.  i can't wait to work with her.
Poor Mac.  It's been a bit of a struggle. I'm sure Sally's told you.
Well, I can't make any promises, and of course I haven't read the script but I loved the novel...when are you shooting?
So they tell me.  Not soon enough, of course.  How are you, Sal?  You look fantastic. It changes your life, you know.  A baby. It puts everything in perspective, doesn't it.  Doesn't it, Mac?  You can't be the center of your own world, anymore.
What what's about?
Oh.
Well, probably.
I'll change back before we leave.
I'd love a Xanex.  Sally, please don't tell Sophia that I'm not breast feeding.
Oh.  Do you have any pictures?
He's gonna miss his flight.
Is he not going?  I booked a flight.
I'm the hired help.
Just did.  Jealous?
Yeah, but I hear she gives a mean blow job.
Let me.  I'm Jeffrey.
Are you my big brave boy?  Are you my brave hero?
Oh yeah?
It was fifteen seconds.
Hey.  Thanks, buddy.
We closed.
I suppose.  Sally, that's quite a gift. I'm not sure it's in your best interest.
The realtor'll be here tomorrow in the morning.  The house had to go on the market to insure the loan on the London flat.
Okay.  I'm sorry, look, I meant to tell you.  It was the only chance I had to meet her.
I'm looking forward to meeting you, too. And Skye, I'm thrilled that you're willing to take this leap with me. Eternally grateful, really.
Of course we do.  We have to sign our taxes.
In the kitchen.
Yes.
Okay, knock it off.
Not properly watered.
I think we should all take it tonight. Everyone's staying, stays.  No driving. That's the rule.  I love you Sally-Mae. You're going to have a fabulous time.
She left the fucking gate open.
What else don't I know about, Joe?  Let's get really clear here.
It's not like this all the time.
You want to talk about bullshit?  Lucy called you three times this week.  She's a fucking mess, Joe.  Your sister is a fucking mess.  She needs you.  I talk to her more than you do.
Anyone else?
I had an abortion two weeks ago.
I don't want to go tonight.
No.
I know.
Has she called?
Coffee?
I love gifts.  What did you guys get us?
Oh.  Well.  Good.
Ah.
The infamous dog?
Ours.
Well, you know...good days, bad days.
Your Eames table is incredible.  And the B&B.  I just put that in a client's home, actually, but in red.
A little out of my element.
And Ryan works at home.
Are you okay?
What am I, five?
That's very nice.
I love it here.  Don't you love it here, Ryan?  I love it here.  And I love tonight.  And I love these people.  And this feels utterly fantastic, Ryan.  Utterly fantastic.
They're really nice people, Ryan. They're like us...
We have to find the dog, Ryan.
What?
I'm sorry.
The charades.
The Shostakovich.
Otis!!  Shostakovich identified with the Jew.  He felt persecuted, hunted, crushed under the thumb of Stalinist imperialism.
Do you really, you really, like Shostakovich?
Would you, like, marry him?
How about someone who really really liked Shostakovich?
How?
Shit.  It's my Galiano.
No.  Really.  For real.  Really.
You're a shit.
Thank you.  This was so unnecessary.  I hope you've noticed that Otis isn't barking as much.  We keep him in at night.
Well the neighborhood is full of dogs, and it's not always Otis.
Monica and Ryan.
Oh my God, sorry.  I'm interrupting.
Isn't this a fabulous picture?
No, no, not at all... I mean I've still got plenty of time.  Don't I?  I mean I still have a good six years, whatever. We could have three kids yet, if we wanted.  And I know I've always said I never wanted kids, and I didn't... but this year, I really, truly, feel ready...
Well, you weren't fine last summer when you went Sylvia Plath on me in Connecticut.
Ha!  Not half so not kind as your husband was in his portrayal of you in his novel.
His image of you is a possessive, fragile neurotic.
Someone who follows his heart!
So uh -- how come I haven't seen you around here before?
The palace, hunh?  I bet those royals really live it up.  Of course they're all a little, you know, from inbreeding --
You watch yours, soldier, or my worker friend will beat you up!
You're the hero of the recent termite campaign, aren't you?
-- At the <u>worker bar</u>!  You were pretty hot to trot then!
Excuse me, I --  Pardon me --  And they call them social insects.
But can there be a society composed of just two ants?
Ha!  Don't make me laugh.  You're crazy about me!  That's why you lied and cheated to get near me!
Now, worker, you shall take me back to the colony, and have your head cut off and stuck on a sharp pole!
Why didn't I listen to my mother ...why'd I have to go looking for trouble? Any ant would have given their left legs to be in my position...what's <u>wrong</u> with me?
Face it, Z, we're lost!  We must have walked halfway across the world by now!  How did I get into this mess...
So...you never did tell me...what made you come out to the worker bar that night?
Bala, that -- that lake we found -- I think the tunnel's right underneath it!  -- Formica's going to <u>flood the</u> <u>colony</u>!!!  That's what he meant when said there were too many ants!
So we're going back for more armor, right?  I mean, these guys are from outer space, how are we supposed to beat them?!
Fourteen-fifty hours, sir.
What do we have on this "Insectopia"?
Well now <u>you</u> haven't fallen for this silly idea of individuality, have you?
May I cut in?
Conversation...yes...well...  Wasn't she briefed?
Your majesty, I'm afraid matters of state keep me from attending the ceremony.
Ask me why we're so successful.
It's a sign that you're crazy!  Do you know what the penalty for impersonating a soldier is?
Wear this.
Mrs. Dreyfuss, can I borrow some coffee -- and maybe an orange and a couple of eggs?
Ma'am?
You wouldn't have such a thing as a napkin, would you?
All right -- I'll tell him.  Hey, Baxter -- that was Personnel. Mr. Sheldrake's secretary.
I've been here twice as long as you have --
You should have stayed in bed this morning.
You mean tonight?
I wasn't trying to be personal -- it's just that the fellows in the office were -- whether you wondering about you ever --
Eight-thirty.
You know, I felt so lousy this morning -- a hundred and one fever -- then my promotion came up -- now you and I -- eleventh row center -- and you said I should have stayed in bed.
Oh, I even know who you live with -- your sister and brother-in- law -- I know when you were born -- and where -- I know all sorts of things about you.
Marry Christmas.
I forgive you.
You couldn't help yourself. I mean, when you're having a drink with one man, you can't just suddenly walk out on him because you have another date with another man. You did the only decent thing.
By the power vested in me, I herewith declare this elevator out of order.  Shall we join the natives?
You all right? What's the matter?
Guess I made a boo-boo, huh?
Maybe if I wore it a little more to the side --  is that better?
Well, as long as you wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with me -- how about the three of us going out this evening -- you and me and the bowler -- stroll down Fifth Avenue -- sort of break it in --
Oh, you don't have to worry about that. I have quite a bit of influence in Personnel. You know Mr. Sheldrake?
No problem. Why don't we discuss it sometime over the holidays -- I could call you and pick you up and we'll have the big unveiling --  -- you sure this is the right way to wear it?
Here.
What is it?
Your phone.
You're in no condition to go anywhere -- except back to bed.
Here. How about some breakfast?
Wait a minute -- let's talk this over first.  Just what are you going to tell her?
You better figure it out -- exactly. Suppose she asks you why you didn't come home last night?
I didn't mean it that way -- I was just talking to him on the phone -- he's very concerned about you.
I am. Let me get the cards.
What do you call it when somebody keeps getting smashed up in automobile accidents?
I was fifteen -- we used to go there to smoke. His name was George -- he threw me over for a drum majorette.
I don't like myself very much anyway.
In this house, you're supposed to.
You mean to someone like Mr. Sheldrake.
I know so. He's a taker.
You can't leave yet. The doctor says it takes forty-eight hours to get the stuff out of your system.
Uh-huh. While I was sitting there, trying to make my mind up, a cop stuck his head in the car, because I was illegally parked -- so I started to hide the gun under the seat and it went off -- pow!
I see you bought some napkins.
How's everything at the apartment?
I guess so.
Oh.
No. You know how people talk. So I decided it would be better if we didn't see each other till everything is settled, divorce-wise.
Good night, Mr. Baxter.
Are you all right?
Where are you going? BUD Who knows? Another neighborhood -- another town -- another job -- I'm on my own.
What about Mr. Sheldrake?
Baxter?
Been hearing some very nice things about you -- here's a report from Mr. Dobisch -- loyal, cooperative, resourceful --
What -- what's that got to do with me? I'm not running any bookie joint.
Sir?
Baxter, an insurance company is founded on public trust. Any employee who conducts himself in a manner unbecoming --  How many charter members are there in this little club of yours?
Where are you going, Baxter?
I'm not through with you yet.
Oh -- terribly sorry. It's that cold --
Not that I have anything to hide.
To me?
So it was.  She threw it at me.
Yes, she's in the shower -- she's coming along fine, considering.
It's about Miss Kubelik -- she's all right again -- so she went back home.
You like?  It's all yours.
My assistant, Roy Thompson, has been shifted to the Denver office, and you're taking his place.  What's the matter, Baxter? You don't seem very excited.
That's just one of the privileges that goes with this job. You also get a nice little expense account, the use of the executive washroom --  Say, what happened to you, Baxter?
I see.
I dig.
What's gotten into you, Baxter?
Mr. Kirkeby, I don't like to complain -- but you were supposed to be out of here by eight.
Hi, Baxter.
Buddy-boy, why didn't you say so?  You got yourself a little playmate, huh?
We went to bat for you -- and now you won't play ball with us.
That's not like you, Baxter. Just the other day, at the staff meeting, I was telling Mr. Sheldrake what a reliable man you were.
Yeah.  Some clown at Schrafft's 57th Street ate a club sandwich, and forgot to take out the toothpick.
Say, Baxter -- the way you're belting that stuff, you must have a pair of cast-iron kidneys.
Sometimes,  there's a twi-night double-header.  A nebbish like you!
Help yourself.
How's the patient?
Say, Baxter -- we're having a little party and we ran out of ice -- so I was wondering --
Oh. Mixed up in that revolution?
What's the matter? Did I do something wrong?
That guy really must've belted him.
Do you know where you are, Fran?
Please -- just let me sleep.
You fool -- you damn fool.
I don't know what you're talking about.
No, Jeff. I can't stay very long.  Can I have a frozen daiquiri?
I don't believe you.
I never said goodbye, Fran.
You're not giving me a chance, Fran. I asked you to meet me because -- I have something to tell you. FRAN Go ahead -- tell me.
You didn't really believe me, did you?
That's enough, Fran.
You're not being funny.
Now, Fran --
Oh. Our friend from the Chinese restaurant. Thanks, Fran. We better keep it here.
That little punk -- after all I did for him! He said I couldn't bring anybody to his apartment -- especially not Miss Kubelik. What's he got against you, anyway?
What are you talking about?
Where does she live?
All right -- I'll take you to the subway.
Thursday? That's The Untouchables -- with Bob Stack.
A little mixup in signals. Let's go.
But I thought you could hold your tongue.
Maybe we should send up two flies -- and see if they'll propagate in orbit.
Look -- we got in a little trouble -- they rudely took our helicopter for MedEvac work on this -- uh Operation Brute Force -- They just brought it back this morning.
How far do you think you can push -- what kind of people do you think --
You make some of your closest friends in the army -- war has a way of bringing men together.
I don't know what you're talking about -- Get fucked --
We've been attacked.
Who the hell are you?
Moonby what?
How about a drink ?
Rangers, eh?
Were you Longe Range Recon --
I didn't know we had units up there in North Vietnam.
Arch light.
Why they call you that?
That's a light down there --
Who's he?
When you kill Cong, don't you feel something.
I don't get it -- You said your mission was to kill him. Let's do it, an' get our asses outta here. This  Kurtz is ruining the war; I mean, this don't look good for America !
Flood.
I met the P.B.R. crew; they were pretty much all kids, except for Phillips, the Chief -- Gunner's Mate Third Class L. Johnson -- Lance Johnson; Gunner's Mate Third Class J. Hicks -- The Chef -- Radio Operator Second Class T. Miller; they called him Mr. Clean.
The Delta closes off to us about ten  miles out of Hau Fat. We'll be able to pick up some supplies -- bit I think there are only two points we can draw enough water to get into the Nung River. It's all Charlie's turf from there on out.
Well, get in there.
What cat  ?
I never heard about that.
They nail him for it bad ?
Jesus -- that guy's too damn much.
What do you want ?
Who is he?
How did they know?
I thought he was a lame.
Attacks repulsed, as I was saying.  This is only  for this war, Captain. Viet Cong -- 54; North Vietnamese regular forces -- 15; South Vietnamese -- 28 -- regular forces and otherwise.  Americain -- 6. Of course, they were, perhaps, mistakes, Captain.
Upriver? Why upriver? There is nothing there, only jungle.
It's an honor to meet you Lance. I've admired your nose-riding for years -- I like your cutback, too. I think you have the best cutback there is.
The wind --
Yeah, I'm an artist, goddamit !
What do you mean?
How big it is?
What'd you do for supplies?
We'll come in low out of the rising sun -- We'll put on the music about a mile out.
Fucking savages.
It's gonna blow this place out. It's gonna ruin it ...
You were not coming here, to see me?
Going back  - to the jungle to die.
Yes...
Love him... Yes, it is true. That's the hard part for me... I knew him better than anyone ... I knew him best.
You were his friend... You must have been, if he had given you this...  If he sent you to his home. He was the best this country had -- he was --
He'll kill us.
Want to say goodbye to the Colonel?
I don't think he'd of shot us on the beach but -- he'd of shot us if he saw me taking the board --
The other one --
Now I can get out a here -- if I can find a way out.
Oh, you don't talk to Colonel Kurtz.  You listen to him. God, these are good. I kept these people off you, you know. It wasn't easy.
Sounds like he's gone crazy.
Do you miss your home, Captain? Have you someone there?
Yes.
What show ?
Soldier -- where''s your C.O.?
Where's your chief supply officer?
What?
Hard to work up an interest in politics, way we live.  You're the first people we've seen in two weeks.
134  CONTINUED:
What makes you so sure my boys won't be waiting for us?
Remember that demon in the gut? Sometimes it's nothing more than wondering if the so-called civilized life has bred the balls and brains out of you.  That's what you want out of this, isn't it?
Let's go.
113  CONTINUED:
184  CONTINUED:
26   CONTINUED:
How did she..?
Stay here.
I'll wear it for you.  And I can wear it when we go home.  We won't be here forever.
Maybe you should drive him into Devil's Cauldron, let them decide what to do with him.
Had no choice...  ...Given the situation.
Six months.  Ecological study for Northland Oil.
Does he have people?
We'll stop here, dig out a snow shelter.
We get wet, we freeze to death in a couple hours.
Let's camp.  There's grayling under this ice. I'll snare some for dinner.
Have to backtrack, find another way down.
Sure love to know where you fit in up here.
Have to get these wet things off.
They think you're in Fairbanks. If not, they still won't find you before the plane comes tomorrow.
I already have.
Talk to that good-looking girl of yours?
Maybe you can talk sense into your boyfriend.
Hullo, Sam.  Slow day?
You better get some sleep.
I need to rent a cabin.
You don't mind me saying, Mr. Desmond, you look like hell.
If Corbett's men find out --
Jiminy Christmas.  What do you want from me?
Look, Mr. Desmond, I didn't count on it turning this ugly.
You can't see past your lousy little assignment, sniffing around the pipeline.  The few voters there are in this district look up to Corbett, and I'm not about to alienate them.
Dead.  Trappers killed him.
LeMalle.  We got a problem. Where's Mitchell?
It's a three-hour flight.  They shoulda got there yesterday.
I ain't gonna leave a seven- hundred-dollar Remington behind.
Kenai's PA -- but how the fuck she seein' us?
Hi...  Did you know there are doctors who come to your house?
Only in the emergency room or when he was well.
Have they done skin testing for allergies?
They haven't done the standard scratch test. Where they make small injections into the skin?
Me. My home number is on this card.
Clippity clop -- clippity clop -- she has to pretend she doesn't hear me. Listening to the story from the upset friend...  now she drops off the cappuccino and smiles at the putzette who doesn't even say, "Thank you." No, the putzette wanted the whipped cream so back she goes and now she has to pass him again and it's getting tougher to make believe.
He's gotta fight to breathe. His asthma can just shoot off the charts -- he's allergic to dust and this is New York and his immune system bails on him when there's trouble so an ear infection...  Is this bothering you?
Sorry.
And if I had to guess by your eyes. I'd say you were kind. So, so much for eyes. But as long as you bring up age...  how old are you?
Okay, pal...  I accept the compliment, but go easy -- my knees start a-knocking when you turn on the charm full blast.
Last week I was playing the piano for him and he likes it, and so I decide I'm going to make a little joke...
Sorry, honey...  I'll be right there.
The doctors had your billing address. I'm sorry about the hour.
So. Anything else?
Funny, I thought it was a strong point.
Are you saying accepting your help obligates me!?
There's... there's no need to bring anything dressy... or... I mean -- I didn't know if we'd be eating at any restaurant that have dress codes.
Okay, gotcha. What did you think I was going to ask?
I'm sure, Simon, they did something real off for you to feel this way... But when it comes to your partners -- or your kid -- things will always be off for you unless you set it straight. Maybe this thing happened to you just to give you that chance.
That's not true. Some of us have great stories... pretty stories that take place at lakes with boats and friends and noodle salad. Just not anybody in this car. But lots of people -- that's their story -- good times and noodle salad... and that's what makes it hard. Not that you had it bad but being that pissed that so many had it good.
My son was outside playing soccer. I never saw him playing ball. Come on, you guys -- take me out for a good time... Take me out dancing.
You wanna dance?
And?
No. Wait. What? Why? I didn't mean it. You gotta sit down. You can still give me the dirty look... just sit down and give it to me.
Have you ever let a romantic moment make you do something you know is stupid?
Sorry, didn't realize she was right there.  Did you have sex with her?
Hello.
I should've danced with you.
Grouchy?
I wasn't asleep!!
Because...
Boyfriend?
Hey, I've got a great compliment for you.
I don't blame you... This is a monumental first day out... You sad or anything?
Well, considering everything's horrible and tomorrow I have to face my parents... Don't ask me ... I'm sick of my own complaints ... got to get me a new set of thoughts.
But you're beautiful... your skin glows.
That long neck -- the line of you... you're porcelain... your back goes on forever. You're classic... you're why cavemen chiseled on walls...
But what about...
What the heck are those for?
You said you could help me -- what was that -- a tease?
How could you do that? He'll hurt him.
It's not my dog and this Simon seems to have enough on his mind -- but he did throw up twice and his spark is off.
Yeah, but it's all about Simon now... you helped with the dog... And now there are other things. I'm just as concerned as you are about Simon.
Actually, I don't think so.
How you doing, great one?
Sorry. What are those cards?
Terrify me?
Absolutely.
I found Verdell, Mr. Udall.
Yes. It's not a subtle point you're making.
Thank you. Verdell...  sweetheart?  By the way, thanks for saving me.
Maybe I'll bring him some food by.
If you'll excuse me I'm not feeling so well.
Well, I'll do one thing for you that might cheer you up.
I brought you Chinese soup.
Do you ever get an erection for a woman?
... Now he's going to want to stay. And they'll want to take a ride to the lake or whatever. So it's a good five hours back. It gives us a chance to take it easy and...
I told you to go on in.
I think you gotta camp it here...
Thank you, Melvin. You overwhelm me.
Sorry, didn't know you were awake. I just thought Verdell shouldn't get too used to sleeping in here 'cause then...
Because...  ... you love her?
But you know where you're lucky?
How do you write women so well?
Nothing. I just watch till something strikes me. Do anything you think of -- try different thing. Until I say, "hold that pose." Then just try and comfortably hold it.
What?
Uh, Fontella's
What are you doing?
You can't --
Sit back.  Put your seatbelt on.
How'd you know?  Just tell me that. How'd you fucking know?
Did you see how I did that?  Magic wasn't it?
How in the fuck do you know that?
Hi.  Up ahead my boss is in that black limo.  We're not sure which hotel we're at, so could you just follow them?
Good afternoon.  We have reservations at the Hotel Paraiso in Costa Blanca.
Send the file.  I'll have the estimate tonight.
Is this how it went, Nick?
What?
Twenty large?  That's all?
Who is that other guy?
How?
Because I'm done.
The same way everyone does; the government, the Agency.
I was just different.
No, they didn't.
Women?  No... not really.
The same reason everyone does.  You hear your name on C-SPAN and you realize you're a skeleton in someone's closet and they're coming to bury you.
Yes.  It didn't matter much to them as long as I disappeared.
My first take?
They become complicated... messy.
This is fiction!  Don't you see that?  This is another reality.  And the people that come into the world to play this game -- nobody forces them!  They're here, they know the rules, the stakes, the risks!  Do you understand what I am saying?  No one is innocent -- including you!
Is that what you wanted to hear? Something cold blooded... something remorseless...
It.  Tell it.  For all I know it could be a machine.
That's where he'll be.
Do you think about the game?
I'm kind of tired.  I think I'd like to try and get some sleep.
What do you think he's doing?
You'll be here.  A restaurant.  A public place far enough away that he won't notice you, but with a good enough view you'll be able to see him when he moves inside.
I'll be walking out of the bank, unarmed.  You'll have the gun and I'll drive the car.
You didn't take it.
Do you have ulcers?
I think I got one today.
Why did you trade a bishop for a knight?
They're worth less points.
It was no big deal.  I saw them leave, I went in.
Nobody ever sees me.
He told me that my curiosity became unnaturally entangled with my sense of self-preservation.
What are you doing?
That's a ridiculous move.
Can I ask you something?
Attraction is a complication?
Was she the only one?
That's okay, hon, I always expect the unexpected.
For what?
Do you think about their wives or their families?
Then, I'll sail alone.
Is that all you want?
How much farther?
You're pretty famous aren't you?
Right.
Can I ask you something?
Yeah.
So how's your work?
Oh yeah, what's that?
What we need is a space for real performance art. A cultural exchange for radical expressionism.
Well, providing we're treated like Czechs and we squat something that's not privately owned, we should be in the clear; at least DOUG  until they get an eviction order and bring in the bailiffs.
I feel like a mole in this joint, so I guess I might as well come out lookin' like one!
Well, we might as well start filling it in now. As long as you leave enough room around that end of the pipe - so I can get to it, we're set. Use them wooden boards to stop it all spilling into the space - We'll neaten it up later.
Not bad hey, I think I'll add Sparkie to my resume.....Good shovel!
Later Mate, right now I've got to do the locks on these doors so we don't have to climb through that bloody window every time.
Yep, except a name for this place.
Perfect, but I can't use it right now, I've got to get these locks done; it's a matter of priorities.
No way, it's sealed - if she's in there she's dead.
Well, it's definitely there - We've just got to get to it.
I'll rig up something don't worry - Do you think I could bash through with that little hammer?
Moved on to plumbing huh?
Destroy the evidence huh.
Let's split.
So why didn't we?
You get the wine and I'll go see if I can rustle up some plastic cups.
Red or white?
I see, you've got your hands too far up your collective arse to pull it out long enough except to drink my bloody wine.
No, We aren't going to do it.
And a tram hit you?
What happened to Katka?
You Romeo's sure pay a high price sometimes - anyone I know?
Don't tell me you really are in love?
I don't want to ruin your day.
Damn!
Well, the trial's in two weeks, but I think they've already sentenced me. They just need to check if Siberia can slot me in.
Maybe, but I've started to wonder what those files were all about. Suppose it was old KGB stuff and had the dirt on big people or maybe the personnel records of the secret police, that might explain all the hassle and the cover-up.
Do you want me to see what's on them?
I can't go with him.
It was a condition of getting Doug out.
Sure, it's on the red metro line you....
There shooting at something.
Now, have you been read your rights and are you aware of the charges?
Hey, Lawrence how are you doing mate?
No! Look Lawrence, I've taken over the lease on a theatre downtown and I'm throwing a party tomorrow night to show it off. It's going to be for alternative arts, but I need some help to finish it off, can you put the word out?
Turned Czech huh?
Why don't you read something after the break? DOUG What here? Weren't you listening to what I just said?
Well, get me and Chris a drink then.
Don't give me this Kat, I'm doing it for you and your country.
Doug I can't, I've got to be at work by eight. You promised to take me home.
I don't want to get in trouble.
I'm not going in Doug. I'll wait for you here.
Kat, I'm in paradise. I don't ever want to leave.
I think I'm stupid.....All you do is use me and expect me to wait for you.
No, I love you, really.
If you get out can we be together again.
Tomorrow, we will bring some lights and also hang some fabric. I think it will be finished in the morning.
You mean you don't know, Henry! We got a bunch of anarchists, controlling a six-level block of luxury apartments down on Janovska street here in the Old Town, and you don't know about it?
I'm in close with these guys, it isn't easy, but slowly they're opening up to me. Give me a month and I'll blow their movement wide open.
There's three thousand and if you don't come through, I'm going throw you clean out of that window. Deal?
Will they free me?
I'll put one on the notice-board too.
I thought I'd help out.
We_re not all running away
Is it dry?
Why don't we both forget about him?
Weren't you going to get some glasses?
And you broke into that room?
You will wish you hadn't.
What was the real purpose behind this venture?
Enjoying our hospitality?
I'll need to make a phone call.
Would you like your things now?
No, just a drill.
When the hell did you write that?
All I'm saying Honey is run the thing past me for Christ's sake before you get up and broadcast the crap.
Shall I look after the rest?
Honey what a pleasant surprise, sorry to keep you waiting.
You are quite sure it's secure?
What are you an idiot!
That's one girl who can't take a hint.
Pictures from the play. Jamie looks pretty --
No. You're with who you should be. It's like she chose you.
Why not?
Your father dropped off an extra check.
There's hot cider in the kitchen.
To see your father?
You do. You're handsome and charming.
That's eight years of school and training -- after college. And all that doesn't necessarily make you a better human being.
Have I told you how proud I am of you -- ?
Don't call him a dipshit.
Get yourself a glass.
He goes to my father's church. He could've died --
You don't know me.
'I hope your dreams come true.'
Yeah.
I'm an enemy?
No problem --
But you think about Him -- It -- Her.
The Bible. Why should I read a bunch of dumb stories about some ancient guy who supposedly worked miracles.
I don't want to be just your friend --
What does that mean?!
Like fire.
Stand right here.
Assholes. This happen to you?
How do you know this place?
From here he proved to me the earth isn't flat.  On rainy days, we'd be above the clouds.
What's the best thing I can see tonight?
From citizen high to citizen low.
One of your secrets.
You're worried about your college applications.
I've talked to your father.
How're you doing?
It's gone now.
I'll talk to your father.
Apropos of nothing... so. So so so so --
Reverend Sullivan. Can I ask you something?
I'd like to take Jamie to dinner on New Year's Eve.
I care for her.
We didn't tell him any different for years --
Shall I give you a few ideas?
For the inner satisfaction it will bring.  Saturday mornings, I'd like you to tutor disadvantaged students at our sister school --
Or something. They're doing a play for the holidays.
Your grades for fall semester. They're -- good.
I don't get it. How come there's no rock 'n roll?
This is 1952....?
Hot tip,  Rubber Biscuit in the third race at Arlington.
I've been calling you for five minutes! Didn't you hear me?
How was school today?
How old are you?
Well, I was on my way to school, and I just wanted to stop by and see if you were feeling okay.  You seemed like you were in pretty bad shape the other night.
What time does school start around here?
Fine..
What do I say?
And where am I gonna be?
You mean, you're gonna --
Your line, George!
Maybe if I used my left....
You know damn well that's not what I meant.
Yeah, explode it up your ass!
You have a name?
Oh -- right! Uh, Madison 3489.
Pro, the sun's out!
But Professor --
A gold mine?
Marty, that would alter history.
You've convinced me that you must be who you say you are. No living human has ever seen this machine.  But why? Why even in my twilight years would I remotely consider sending someone back in time?
Pardon me?
Professor. Well, not exactly, Professor. You see, we don't point it at the sun.
4200 rads...  That certainly can't be generated under controlled conditions in this day and age.
The test is this Monday! 15 megatons... Let's see, we need 4200 rads...  You'd have to be...exactly 800 yards from ground zero... You realize that what we're going to do could be extremely dangerous.
Your 'mother' wanted me to tell you that she was very impressed by what you did this afternoon, and that if you were interested in going to the dance Saturday, she's available.
Apparently, what has happened is that the maternal instinct has transcended the gap of time and this has caused an alteration in your mother's emotional behavior.
Thanks for everything, Pro.
You see, I never rebuilt the time machine after it was destroyed in 1952. I decided that experimenting with time and possibly changing history was too risky. Anyway, experiments in time travel were banned in all 87 states after the governor of Cuba caught Dr. Felstien fooling around in the Bermuda Triangle -- that was back in '64.
But if you didn't rebuild the time machine, how did I go back in time in the first place?
Look, maybe I'd better talk to Dick. Is he around?
...He just lets himself get pushed around all the time! People walk all over him and he never fights back, never stands up for himself.
Hi. where's Cato?
Nah, skip that... I'm going to have to keep an eye on you, though.
You promise to stay down there for an hour?
What you been doing?
Oh yeah?
We did it, Ray.
You like people?
Well, Kit...
You know, before I met her, nobody could ask me how I was doing with my girl. Matter of fact, I didn't really have one.
Listen. I got a lot of respect for her, sir.  That's about as good a one as I know to tell you.
No, you're not either.
Okay.
Well, I know what my daddy's going to say.
Quit my job.
What a nice place.
That we should crunch our hands with this stone. That way we'd never forget what happened today.
Listen, maybe we ought to tell somebody about this.
Why?
"The Kon-Tiki in motion was a little different from what it usually was in such conditions. We had become sensitive to changes in the rhythm of the logs. I thought at once of suction from the coast, which was drawing near, and was continually out on the deck and up the mast..."
Is he upset?
Whatcha looking in there for? We can't afford any of that.
Later we found out she was deaf and we hadn't even known it.
Have you got a better idea?
Hi.
Hi, whatcha doing?
You're my friend, aren't you?
Who are you?
Think I'll take the juice?
You tossed my hat out the window.
Halloween. 1938..."War of the Worlds"...that fake radio news broadcast that got everybody scared, thinking that real live Martians were landing in Grover's Mill, New Jersey!  But then it all just turned out to be a hoax.
Forgive the butterfingers, Buckaroo.  Casper Lindley, Knight of the Blue Shield, at your disposal.  And my son, Scooter.
Not me. No way.
Buckaroo!  What the Sam Hill!
Planet 10?
I'm starving...somebody, help.
What crate?
Buckaroo, you got a minute--?
These antidote filters the Professor's whipped up will let you to see them like I have since yesterday, as arachtoidal creatures. They won't be pretty, nothing personal, John Parker.  But just remember...if we fail tonight, there's no tomorrow.
They're arachtoids, Buckaroo, from Planet 10!
...but he wasn't the real Doctor Lizardo...just this arachtoid creep that stole the good doc's body the year before in the Eighth Dimension when Prof. Hikita's lab exploded...
Somebody get her a mike? Can we manage that?  And a spotlight.  What's your name?
Go away.  Let me rot?
Was she pretty?
Having a little trouble with that knot, aren't you?
Open up or I'll shoot it off.
Yes, I do.  Gimme a chance.  I'm stronger than you think.
I gotta go.  We're on borrowed time.
You've got your six guns strapped on.  You're ridding off on another adventure?  Oh, my God, it's all real...it really is real.  I should go with you.  Please...
...hit Smolensk and precipitate a thermonuclear war, Mr. President.
Where was it, John O'Connor? How far back?
What's happening with my call to SAC?
How long you been riding with Buckaroo, Reno?
What'd you do before?  Can I ask?
It's a spittin' image.
We're waiting for the Jet Car.  Billy's bringing it.
So where's Buckaroo?
Unscheduled surgery.  He'll be waltzing along momentarily.  What're you doing tonight?
Perhaps the three of us, Mr. Fink.
No, sometimes he just... well, he thinks about Estelle. His wife still lives in Fayettesville. She's... disturbed.
...This'll sometimes help.
Barton, I'm afraid it's not a good time-
I'll try to slip out. If he quiets down, passes out... I'm afraid he thinks - well, he said you were a buffoon, Barton. He becomes irrational-
...Hello.
No, I - I didn't mean to sound -
Sir, I'm flattered that you even recognize my name. My God, I had no idea you were in Hollywood.
Don't worry about it. It's just a B picture. I bring it in on budget, they'll book it without even screening it. Life is too short.
Bill Mayhew! Some help! The guy's a souse!
Barton? What time is it? Are you all right?
...That's fine.
Well, I don't mean to get up on my high horse, but why shouldn't we look at ourselves up there?  Who cares about the Fifth Earl of Bastrop and Lady Higginbottom and - and - and who killed Nigel Grinch-Gibbons?
Jesus, I hope I'm not interrupting you again. I heard you walking around in here.  Figured I'd drop by.
Oh, yeah. An ear infection, chronic thing.  Goes away for a while, but it always comes back. Gotta put cotton in it to staunch the flow of pus. Don't worry, it's not contagious.
Nope, never watched any. I'm not that interested in the act itself -
...Did I say rude? People can be goddamn cruel. Especially some of their housewives. Okay, so I've got a weight problem. That's my cross to bear. I dunno...
And there's hope for you too, Charlie. Tomorrow I bet you sell a half-dozen policies.
...Your room does that too?
Hold on. I said hold on, so hold on.
What do you think happened?
Jesus, Charlie, I...
But Charlie - why me? Why -
Mr. Lipnik, I -
Mr. Lipnik, I really would feel much better if you could reconsider -
F-I-N-K. Fink, Barton. That must be you, huh?
Doctor. Ear, nose and throat man,.
Hollywood precinct finds another stiff yesterday. Not too far from here. This one's better looking than the doc.
Why's it so goddamn hot out here?
Mr. Fink hasn't given a preference, Mr.  Lipnik.
...Thanks Lou. Join us. Join us. Talking about the Wallace Beery picture.
Okay.  I went after him.  I lost my temper.
Yeah, I was drinking.
Come on -- I'm going to storm into his office in front of everybody in the afternoon and then that night I'm going to kill him?  I'd have to be really dumb to do that.
I want you in Dr. Gardner's office at nine o'clock.  You're out of control, Curran.
How about the booze?
How about the coke?
What are you doing here?
I need a cigarette.
It's the least I could do... considering I got you into this mess with those reports.
How do you know Catherine Tramell saw my reports?
She must really be something.  From a clinical point of view.
What do you want, Nick?
She's really sick you know.  Don't you know what she's doing?  She knows I went to Berkeley.  She knows I knew Noah.  She makes up that story about me.  She's handing you somebody who's obsessed with he her.
Did you go home with him?
Was there anyone with you last night?
Yes, you do.
How did you feel when he died?
But you didn't hurt --
If I were guilty, and if I wanted to beat that machine, it wouldn't be tiring.  It wouldn't be tiring at all.
I'd like to ask you a few more questions.
Yes.  She's helped me understand homicidal impulse.
I don't know about that I don't have any money I don't have any attorneys Gus is my only real friend.
Why not?
Yes.
Are you kidding?  You think this is my idea of morning-after conversation?
I should have known.  I came into the house when you were down on the beach.  She looked at me so strangely.  She left right after you.  I shouldn't have let her watch us. She wanted to watch me all the time.  She tried to kill you, didn't she?
I just thought I'd surprise you.  What's the matter?
I'm writing a book.
They fuck like minks, raise rugrats, and live happily ever after.
Why not?
Did you ever engage in sado- masochistic activity with him?
You have the right to an attorney.
You workin' on another book?
The answer is no.  I didn't kill him.
I had another one of you guys down here from Frisco -- about a year ago -- he asked me the same question.  What's this about anyway?
Yeah, he said it was routine too. Now it's two guys saying it's routine.
Nope, can't say that I do.
What's goin' down, son?
You think I --
Everybody that she plays with dies.
You feeling better?
I don't know.  I'm just not.
It doesn't make sense.  She didn't know me three months ago.
Why not?
If she's telling  you the truth.
Maybe it's for old-time's sake.
Are you kidding me?
What is all this "Nick" stuff -- Nick would you like a cigarette. Nick can you give me a ride.
She knew she could beat it.  That's why she asked to take it.
How did they die?  Was there an investigation?
Fuck you, Phil.
Beth?  Now you've got Beth killing people?
We know you're not stupid, Ms. Tramell.
How old was she when this happened?
He died -- about five or six years ago.
You're asking me this because of the 'lapdog' remark. I read that. The person that wrote that has the compassion of a housefly. That's your enemy, not your audience. Your audience hasn't even been born yet. It's a lie that art is popular. The only thing popular about it is that it's written about in newspapers. I'm surprised when anybody comes to my openings. There're about ten people on the planet who know anything about painting, and Andy's one of them.
Nixon lives in Saddle River, New York.
I wish they'd quit writing this shit about me.
Everybody's paying top dollar for scraps of paper, refrigerator doors - anything with a SAMO tag on it.  The other day, I just wanted a pack of cigarettes, so I did a drawing and sold it for two bucks. A week later this gallery calls me up: "Somebody's offering us the drawing. Should we buy it for five thousand?"
That girl looks just like my old girlfriend Gina.
That was my favorite part!
Bruno called. In Europe, people are saying you're gonna die from drugs. They think they can cash in on your death.
Well, I don't want to get mugged on a Bowery street corner. Maybe I could find a place for you to work. Take my card.
B.B. It's me - Jean! What's the matter? No snow in Switzerland this year?
I hear your show was sold out already. There's a very important collector who's interested in some of your works.
Bruno spoke to me already. We could talk about it.
Yes. What do they... stand for?
Hmmmm. Interesting. And when you grew up were there any primitives hanging in your home?
Hey - Willie Mays.
Your people.
Willie Mays!!! Willie Mays!!!
You gonna carry that around all night?
Which island of Hawaii do you want our house to be on? Maui? Kaui? Molokai?
... babies.
Wow. Congratulations. I hate that asshole.  Thanks for coming. I guess I just wanted to find out how you're -
Baby, I think about you a lot. I'm really sorry about everything. You have to believe me. I'm serious. I wish, y'know, that we were -
You don't have to be sorry. There's no one to blame. Jean, you're a real artist. I thought I was one. You made me realize I wasn't.
Is that the best quality you have?
See you later.
Uh huhh... Band practice?  It's Benny. He wants to know why you're not at band practice...?
That one's for you.
You nuts? Let him order? You on his side? You're not such a good waitress. You get out, too.
I need this?
YO! Jean, this is Ramellzee.
It's cold.
Ah.  "Who", may I ask, are you going "as"?
How could you?  I'm a woman...
First you're gonna shut up.  Then you're gonna turn yourself in.
Pouring myself into my work.
You've got a dark side, Selina Kyle.
Well, I'm... braver at night, if that's what you mean...
I'm sure he's wonderful company and all, but ... doesn't the gold- plated bachelor bit get a little ... stale?
Well?  Was "Vicki" right?  About your difficulty with duality?
It's the so-called "normal" guys who always let you down.  Sickos never scare me.  At least they're commited.
I'd offer you coffee, but my assistant is using her vacation time.
Mayors come and go.  And heirs tire easily.  Really think a flyweight like you could last fifteen rounds with Muhammed Shreck.
Not compared to that "Cobblepot" person you're promoting...
My blood?  I ... I gave at the office.
Appetite for destruction? Contempt for the czars of fashion? Wait don't tell me ... Naked sexual charisma?
Are you perchance a registered voter?  I'm also a mayoral prospect.
Y'mean frame him?
Let's consummate our fiendish union!
Yes.  <u>Yes</u>.  Boyfriend trouble ..?
Ten, nine...
Actually this is all just a bad dream.  You're home in bed. Heavily sedated, resting comfortably, and dying from the carcinogens you've personally spewed in a lifetime of profiteering. Tragic irony or poetic justice? You tell me.
What, is that supposed to "hypnotize" me?
A lot of tape and a little patience make all the difference.  By the way, how's Fred Adkins, your old partner?
You know what, Mr. ... Penguin-Sir? I think perhaps I could help orchestrate a little welcome-home scenario for you.  And once we're both back home, perhaps we can help each other out ...
Bu ... wh ... I ... I mean ...
I got my own ... <u>quest</u> to pursue up here.  It's crucial I not get sidetracked, with some silly ...
Reclaim my birthright, y'mean?
He didn't even lose a limb, an eyeball ... bladder control ..
Working late?  I'm touched.
... Where did curiosity get the cat?
Selina?!  Selina ... Selina ...
Morning, Max.  Bummer about the store.  You insured?
I'm sorry.  I was too late.
Uncle Alfred?
But I can't can I?
I've spent my whole life trying to beat back death.  What good are all my heroics now if I can't save you?
Alfred, old friend, I could use your help right now.
I'm on break from-
This is to replace the bike I lost. I'll get you the rest.
Of course, Dick Grayson, ward of the fabulously wealthy Bruce Wayne. Why would you need a few hundred dollars?
Alfred has supported me my whole life.  Now I'm going to pay him back. I'm going to liberate him from his dismal life of servitude.
Paying someone to prepare your meals and do your laundry and clean your dishes, you call that family?
This is easy.
Remember the victim at the airport. Toxins introduced through the mouth.
I guess we'll just have to kill her.
No sign of the snowman.
Acceptable losses in a battle to save the planet.
Physical perfection, charm and wealth tossed over for a dowdy spinster. How do you explain your behavior?
You're not even listening to me.
That's no batlight, it's a birdcall.
And she did it all for me.  For love.
You'd say anything to keep me away from her.  To keep her for yourself.
One question.  When Batgirl and I rolled off the telescope, how come you didn't try and save us? It was the first time I fell and you weren't there to catch me.
Trust me.  Vegetable magnetism.
Make yourself right at home.
There was nothing I could do.  Batman deactivated her.  She's dead.
I have created a race of plants with the strength of the deadliest animals.  Once you have frozen mankind, my mutants will overrun the globe.  The Earth will become a brave new world of only plants. And we shall rule them.  For we will be the only two people left in the world.
You will distract the bat and bird while I prepare to freeze Gotham.
Inspired, Ms. Ivy.
Okay, my hair is brittle, my skin is dry and I don't care.  I'd weather blizzards to have you. You're the most perfect man I've ever known.
Give it up.  If you threw yourself-
How about dangerous curves?
You should have heeded your pointy- eared pal.  These lips can be murder.
...Our original sponsor had no stomach for military applications. he cut the funding for our work -
It'll never work.
Scholarly research?
Too much wealth. Too fast. Half of Gotham zombied-out. A technology that self destructs. He's protecting more than industrial secrets, Alfred.
She's the first woman in a long time that's... No. She's the first woman ever. And she loves Batman. Not Bruce Wayne. If I let go of Batman I'll lose her.
How are you feeling, young man?
I'm Batman? I remember my life as Bruce Wayne.  But all this. It's like the life of a stranger.
...A bat.
Letters in the alphabet.
And another name for Mystery?
What now sir?
Welcome, Master Grayson. I'm Alfred.
May I help you, Master Grayson?
_Two_ million dollars waiting to be transferred from the _Second_ Bank of Gotham on the _22nd_ How could Harvey? _Two_-Face resist?
A girl cannot live by psychoses alone.
You are direct, aren't you?
Help Chase. I'll be back.
Welcome to my parlor said the Riddler to the Bat. How's tricks?
Um...I'm pretty sure I'm Bruce Wayne. And you are?
La'chiem.
My opinion. This letter writer is a total wacko.
Patient apparently suffers from acute obsessional syndrome with potential homicidal styles. Work better for you?
He sure did.
The style of the letters I'm getting matches those found at the crime sites. Why would The Riddler be sending me riddles?  Who's your decorator? U-Haul?
Oh God, Bruce. You're still jealous.
Where will you go? The circus is halfway to Metropolis by now.
Exactly. And once you'd killed him you'd be lost. Like me.  All this has to be a choice. Otherwise...it's a curse.
Hell. Might even bring old Stickley here a few extra bucks. Huh, Fred?
Yet so bright and chipper and conservative!  It's so you.  And yet so _you_!  Very few people are both a summer _and_ a winter. But you pull it off nicely.
Holy shit.
No.  Wait...
Go ahead. You can say it.
B-12.
How high up would you say that is?
You know, if you cut your bathroom in half, you'd have my apartment.
I know the feeling. It won't last.  He's a long way ahead of where I was at his age.
How long's it been, Alfred? A quarter of a century?  It seems like yesterday. I guess we ended up doing more harm than good.
Like your boyfriend. He's kinda hot.
Gosh, I could kill you, but then you'd miss my party. And you, Batman -- you're the guest of honor!
GET IN THE CAR!!
Look! Police!
Thank you, Vicki.
... How long have I been out?
Great.  Give me a grant.
Do you sail?
Bruce, really, when I say these things I don't mean to criticize you.
Bruce, at the rate you're going, you can't even save yourself.
It's like the last time. He sent me a present before he --
Oh, Bruce. Don't tell me you carry it around with you.
I'm sorry, she hung up. What are --
How can you do that if she's already off the line?
I don't, but... I do. It's just... I love you, Bruce. I don't want you to...
All right, Bruce, what do you suggest?
I answer to Grissom, punk.  Not to you.
Let's beat it, man.  I don't like it up here.
I dunno, man.  After what happened to Johnny Gobs - -
Five stories, straight down. There was no blood in the body.
There was no blood, man.  My brother says... all the bad things you done... they come back and haunt you...
Okay, a break-in.  Trash the office, make off with the books ... "Industrial espionage."
I'll see you burn.  I'll see you dead -- GET AWAY FROM ME!!
Oh, it's too good.  We got a six-foot bat that swoops out of the night and preys on evildoers.
Where does one man get all this junk?
Rich.  Reclusive.  Bankrolls half a dozen charities.
Plain or roasted?  Alex, I'm very flattered that you've gone out and done all this research.
Yep.  He watched the whole thing happen - - Recognize the beat cop?  Jim Gordon
Allie, I know exactly why you're doing this.
Alexander... I know you.
LOOK! IT'S BRUCE!!  Allies -- the balloons. We've got to find some way to tell him!
Jennifer can stay and look after Kevin
David - are you ever going to learn to say 'no'?
It's the last thing we need.
Ali?  What's wrong?
Yes.  And	I have a wine for dinner that will kill you.
Sort of half.....
David.  There's a call for you.  It's your wife.
Seems to be a problem with the door. Where's the picture gone?
It's very good Bernie.
It's great when people who work together can become real friends.
Look, I've left Bean on his own. Nice to chat though Bernie - always a subtle joy.
Everything okay, David?
Lord Walton assures me this guy's one of the very top scholars in the English art world.  Has a couple of doctorates no less.
This is Elmer, our longest serving...
Okay, that'll do.  The Governor's here in half an hour.  We have to be totally ready then.  No excuses.  Period!
He's a man with a plan who will haul us into profitability and the 21st century.
I said say that again, son - because the next time you do, I'll make sure you're in there with my daughter, but in a slightly less healthy state and she's in a coma with a broken arm right now.
The thing is, sir, I've just been giving the painting a very thorough inspection, with the help of Dr Bean here - and we feel the time's come for Whistler's Mum to have her first face-lift.
I owe you a very serious apology, young man.  It wouldn't surprise me if you wanted to leave us after this.  I sincerely hope that you do not.
Maybe two cars.
You've known me five years Elmer. When do you get to calling me David?
I've known soldiers who've had their heads blown off who were more intelligent than you two.  Not only have you failed to protect your most valuable possession from theft - but you didn't even know it'd been stolen!  I'd sooner buy heroin from the guy who sells drugs outside my grandson's school than anything from you guys.
This sucks.
Huh huh huh. He said "anus."
What a dork. Huh huh.
Uh, huh huh, this is Las Vegas?
Huh huh. This says Beavis.
That's Butt-Head. Don't you get it, Beavis. These dudes have the same name as us.
Beavis. This is what it's all about.
Huh huh huh huh huh huh.
Huh huh huh. I'm ready for love.
So, uh, huh huh. Are we gonna score now?
This is dumb, let's find that chick.
Dammit, all they have is shows about water.
Yeah or like a Seven-Eleven or something... Are we almost there?
Uh...
Hey Butt-Head, isn't there supposed to be like, water in cactuses?
Uh, you first.
Yeah, heh heh. Umm, isn't Seattle in Washington? Heh heh... 'cuz I was thinking maybe we could go see Hole.
Well where is she?!
Huh huh huh. Settle down Beavis.
Heh heh. Fire. Heh heh Aaaaeeehhhhg!!!
Hey Butt-Head, do you think we're ever gonna score?
Oh yeah. Can you just take us to Washington? We're gonna meet her there and, you know, heh heh hmmm...
Really? I poop too much.
Why does everyone wanna see my schlong?  I am the one-and-only-almighty-bungholiooo!
What the hell...? Bork! That bus we picked up. Where was it headin'?
Not on him, Chief.
Chief, look!
Cool, huh huh huh.
Muddy! Sonofabitch! Hold it. What's he payin' ya?
Adam my booyy!  When you're really rich in what matters...  ... nothing matters!  My buyer has just made a killing in condos in the Village.  And he's got a little stress problem...  ... so his wife says they want the old peace and quiet!
Wave at the lion.
This fire wasn't burning when we left the house.
I'll tell you what, Barbara.  I don't think we survived that crash.
Anything happen while I was away?
Hon... I didn't want to die, but really, this is fine with me.  As long as I never have to wash dishes again.
Is this a punishment for something we did in life?  What can we do?
That's it?  No number, or instructions?
There's nothing we can do.  It's just a matter of time before they unlock this room.  There goes my model.  There goes our last refuge.
What about this Beetle guy?
Are you crazy?  She can't hear you.
What happened?
Has anything been simple so far? From the look of the shovel, we dig.
I guess we open it.
She's only fourteen...
Ah, Adam, you don't know anything about little girls.  She's just... missed out on some love, that's all...
We've been given a gift here, honey.  A real live little girl. She likes us a lot.  She needs us. Maybe that's why we died so young, to keep us from getting so... attached to <u>things</u>.  The house, antiques, your model.  Look at us. We didn't have room for anyone.
What?
Nobody else can.
<u>You</u> did this?  You carved all these little figures and houses and things?
And this used to be your house, I bet.  Why do you want to scare everybody?
Did you get the paint?
You don't have an appointment, do you?
Okay.  But that Betelgeuse sure seemed mad.
I heard.  Tore your face right off!  Bad news.  It obviously doesn't do any good to pull your heads off in front of people if they can't see you.
Just one daughter.
Folks, be reasonable here.  I'm at your service.  You be the judge. I'm a harmless guy.  Try me.
I don't like Charles Deetz particularly, but you could have <u>killed</u> him.
Tell the truth.
We can't.  We haven't left the house since the funeral.
I want to be dead too.
Hi, Barb!  I'm glad I caught you. I heard you were on vacation!
Look at me, think of me as cash! This offer is really real!  From a rich man in New York City who only saw a photograph!
No, I mean they've gone. Decamped.  Split.  Vanished.
Well, yes, of course.  It's great over here.  You'll meet all the greats.  James Dean.  Buddy Holly.  'The little things a you say and do... make me want to be with you-a-hoo.'
Minor problem.  The rules.  I can't tell it to you.  But... do you know how to play charades?
Your name is <u>Beetle Juice</u>?  Yecch! That's as bad as <u>Deee</u>lia <u>Deee</u>tz.
You were the snake!  Right?  I know.  I saw you.
They'd look silly on me.  I'm fourteen years old!
Otho knows as much about the supernatural as he knows about interior decoration.
Skeleton keys never work.  Anyway, this can wait.  We'll get a crowbar later.  Your mother...
Stepmother's...
Well this is... I mean, this is the weirdest --
Now, let's get back to business. I want to get Maxie Dean and Sarah up here immediately.  I can make history here!  I'm going to turn this sleepy little backward town into a leading supernatural research center... and amusement park.
Great idea, Maxie!  Those Japanese could <u>run</u> it for us.  Build them a dormitory in the woods.  Listen, think right about it, will you? We've almost got the house ready, you bring Sarah with you and I'll show you.
Don't you <u>dare</u>.
What's wrong?
<u>Oh my God</u>!
Is there much more of this torture?
I have a feeling there's some very interesting space behind this door.
It's bad luck.  And I believe hugely in luck.
All presences have a home space. A place where they live, so to speak.  Where do they hide out?
The injection will ease the pain and swelling, Mr. Gardiner.
You can pull your trousers up, now.
Just to take the proper precautions, Mr. Gardiner, I'd recommend we take you downstairs and X-ray your leg.  ... By the way, Mr. Gardiner, I would like to ask you something straight out.
Yes. Are you planning on making any sort of claim against the Rand's?
Will you be leaving now, Robert?
... No, of course you don't. Excuse me for being so presumptuous. No man knows everything about another man - however, very few are honest enough to admit it.
Some pain is to be expected...  ... And I think what would be best for the two of you is a good night's rest.  ... It's late, I'm afraid it's time for my patients to prepare for bed.
No more, Robert... No more needles...
How true. Mr. Gardiner may be a welcome change of pace.
At times, yes. But that's not an uncommon reaction to such an accident. Actually, I found him to have quite a sense of humor.
We have to find him, Robert - he could be lost, something may have happened, we can't leave him!
I do - we do - both of us, Ben and I feel so much for Chauncey...
Well, he said it was his, he walked us through it.
Of course, Doctor, I understand.
Of course. They would like you to appear on the show tonight. The Vice President was scheduled, but he had to cancel, and they asked if you would be interested.
... Why, yes, he is... Is your leg feeling any better?
Oh, by the way - I'm Eve Rand.
... I'll feel so relieved after Dr. Allenby examines your leg. After that, David can run you on home, or to your office or wherever you'd prefer...  ... Is there anything special you would like to watch?
I can see that it must be very important for you to stay informed of all the latest events.
Chauncey, I wanted to tell you how dreadful I feel about the accident today, but that I'm delighted that you are staying with us.
He does...?
Forgive me, Chauncey - I didn't mean to pry. You must have been very close to him.
And Benjamin sends along his best wishes.
... You know, Chauncey... I want us to be...  I want us... You and I to become... close... I want us to become very close, you know...?
Chauncey, where have you been? I was afraid you got bored and left, or that you were with some mysterious woman.
I just don't excite you at all... I don't know what you want... I don't know what you like...
To watch...? To watch me...?
Hello, Mr. Gardiner. This is Sid Courtney, Washington Post.
I'm sorry to disturb you, Mr. Gardiner, I know you must be very busy.
Good, sir. And so, it seems, did the President - but we would like to have some facts; such as, uh... What exactly is the relationship between yourself and that of the First American Financial Corporation?
Do you need a doctor? I could call Robert...
I see.
Bravo! Bravo! Our chairs are indeed almost touching! And we want to remain seated on them, correct? We don't want them snatched from under us, am I right? Because if one goes, the other goes, and then - boom! Boom! And we are both down before our time, you see? And neither of us wants that, do you agree?
Yes, it is very good!
I feel very good in here.
Bravo!
Well, that's good news, my boy.
Oh, sure you do, the financial assistance program. I think you might be just the man to take charge of such an undertaking. I'd like you to meet with the members of the Board, we'll be able to discuss the matter at greater length at that time.
Let me feel the strength in your hand, Chauncey... Let me feel your strength...  Yes, that's good... I hope, Chauncey - I hope that you'll stay with Eve... Take care of her, watch over her, she's a delicate flower, Chauncey...
Watch? You mean just watch me? Doing it alone?
Of course not! No one has the time to read! One glances at things, watches television...
... Sir?
I am allowed to go to the attic and select any of the Old Man's suits. They all fit me very well. I can also take his shirts, shoes and coats.
Let's have a look, do you mind?
... Hmmm... Elevator.
Well, ain't that the truth...
Fine, then let's get started. The current state of our country is of vital interest to us all, and I would like to know if you agree with the President's view of the economy?
Hello, Thomas... I'm Chance, the gardener.
... Are you waiting for someone? An appointment?
Mr. Chance, that was twenty-seven years ago.
Mr. Chance, assuming what you say is the truth, I would like to know what sort of claim you are planning to make against the deceased's estate.
Correct.
Well, Mr. Gardiner, that's just fine with me - I'm a man that appreciates a frank discussion... Be seated, please, Mr. Gardiner...
Yes. I will.
... Sid, be reasonable - I've been everywhere, there's no place left to check!
I shall take the gentleman to the third floor guest suite, ma'am. Dr. Allenby is standing by.
Eve, child! How nice of you to come.
Come on, Eve. Let's let the men talk, there are so many people that have been asking about you.
I can certainly understand that...
... Would you take me on a tour?
Yes? What have you found?
But... Where was this man Gardiner before last week?
Kaufman, I'm going to need information on Mr. Chauncey Gardiner's background.
So...? Where the hell is it?
What the hell are you talking about, Kaufman?
... So what does all that add up to?
... Well?
Well, Ben... I...
No, she flew up to Boston for another charity event. She'll be sorry to have missed you.
You take care too, Bobby.
I'll get right to the point, Larry. I'm a puppet now...
I'm being controlled by the world's greatest puppeteer, Craig Schwartz...
Is the trial date set?
Isn't that cute? I just taught her that.
I was worried.
Tom-Tom's puncture wound is infected.
The iguana.
Why aren't you at work?
Why?
What are you doing?
I'm getting rid of the fucking animals.
You were him last night, weren't you?
I'm sorry. That was nasty.
Sometimes we're forced to make hard decisions.  I'd like for us to stay together, Craig. You know, platonically, if that's possible. I truly value our friendship.
I'm your Goddamn wife. Once you vowed to cherish me forever. Now you hold a gun to my head?
Suck my dick!
Ah, but you're forgetting one thing, Lambchop.
Once this was a relationship based on love. Now you have me in a cage with a monkey and a gun to my head.
Maybe this is what you've always been, Craig, you just never faced it before.
It's okay, Craig. It all worked out, in an odd sort of way.
I don't know. There's a small community of us. We have a place they don't know about. We're happy. We'll keep trying to figure out a way. Come stay with us. Join the struggle.
Sure, after a fashion.
You? Why I'm sure it would pale in comparison to the actual experience.
Welcome to LesterCorp. May we meet your filing needs?
Money, Miss Warts?
No thank you sir. It's delicious, though. I just wanted to thank you for the opportunity to work at LesterCorp, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to tender my resignation effectively immediately.
Uh, import-export. Olive oil. Right on 7 1/2 actually.  In the vacant office. So we'll still be seeing each other.
There are rules, boy, procedures, etiquette. This is not a toy. I've been waiting seventy years to utilize this room, grooming myself, quietly setting the stage, performing ablutions, paying tribute, seeing all his motion pictures again and again. Worshipping, Schwartz, worshipping properly.
Why not?
Who told you?
Made it. Maxine. Maxine, Maxine, Maxine.
I'm not a homosexual. I just like women for more than their bodies. I guess you could say I'm the new American male.
I mean, I am really attracted to you.
Don't you want to know what happened to me?
Yes, of course. He's a celebrity.
Tickets to Malkovich?
Really?  But, Maxine, can of worms! End of the world! Illusory nature of existence!
What happens when a man climbs through his own portal?
Hi. Wendy! What're you up to in this vacant office.
Must you take this terrible demon on yourself, my love?
No. Don't be an ass.
Two hundred dollars, please.
No, a sexy dream. Of course, a scary dream.
How'd it go? Did you say the philodendron gets water or no?
What kind of circumstances?
Oh, he's good! Great, actually. I saw him do "Tru" with his sixty foot Robert Morse puppet. Sensational.
Do tell. I love a good plan.
Can you do that? I mean, do you know anything about puppetry?
I gotta know the truth, Kevin.
Ah.
Yeah, I saw them
Yeah?
Can I get you a drink?
Thanks so much for coming over.
So, do you enjoy being an actor?
I'm sorry, did you just call me "Lotte"?
Oh, my sweet, beautiful Lotte.
I'm getting better all the time.
No one would ever have to know its not him.
Vegas.
This is it, lover. You're stepping onto that stage a nobody and presto-change-o, you're coming back the greatest puppeteer the world has ever seen.
Sleepy suddenly.
Why you never go back to Lady Jone's and learn your letters? You liked going there I remember. Seeing the other children. Then all a sudden, you stop.
I got a delivery around here. Name of Tucker.
What world are you talking about? Ain't nothing harmless down here.
You can't do that, Baby. It ain't right.
What'd be the point? Not a house in the country ain't packed to the rafters with some dead Negro's grief. We lucky our ghost is a baby. My husband spirit come back? Or yours? Don't talk to me! Ha..You lucky. You got one child left, still pullin at your skirts. Be thankful. I had eight. Eight with six fathers. Every one of them gone from me. Four taken, four chased and all, I expect, worrying somebody's house into evil. My first born - alls I can remember of her now is how she loved the burned bottom of bread. Her little hands..I wouldn't know'em if they slapped me. Can you beat that? Eight children and that's all I remember.
Oh, I remember bits and pieces of all of'em I guess..Halle, of course..I had Halle a lifetime. Almost twenty years... My two girls, sold and gone before I could even a heard about it, and them without their grown up teeth yet. My third child, my son after Halle...I let that straw boss have me for four months so's I could keep that boy. Next year, he had him traded for lumber anyway and me pregnant with his child. I couldn't love that child. I wouldn't. Not any of the rest either. God take what He would....and He did...
WATCH OUT FOR HER; SHE CAN GIVE YOU DREAMS.
I had another dream last night.  The dead man laying on top of me and I had nothing to eat. And the ghosts without skin stuck their fingers in me and said Beloved in the dark and bitch in the light..
Not for me, you don't! You don't let me eat the pies...
You on your way home?
Yes?
What you want'em for?
You Baby Sugg's kin, ain't you?
Bet you do. Everybody miss her. That was a good woman...Well, I don't know whether the Bodwins think it or not but they sure could use some extra help.
I want to work, Miss Lady.
Food. My mama, she doesn't feel well. I couldn't stay away from her too long, cause of her condition but I could do chores in the mornings.
Could be that fall you took.
She likes to see you off in the morning.
Morning.
MAMA!
Nobody..no sir..that's right..nobody's going be doing that..nobody going be writing my daughter's characteristics on the animal side..no sir..I don't care..ain't laying that down..no sir. I refuse..that's right..that's right...
True.
It's her, ain't it?
Oh yeah. Oh that's load off. I thought everybody gone crazy.
Stamp, leave off I said! I knew her when she was a girl. She scares me and I knew her when she was a girl...
She scares me. I scare me. And that girl in her house scares me.
Not too sweet! You make it too sweet they don't eat it.
Hey!!
Manolo will load it into your car for you, uh, Dude.
Mr. Lebowski is prepared to make a generous offer to you to act as courier once we get instructions for the money.
They called about eighty minutes ago.  They want you to take the money and drive north on the 4 5.  They'll call you on the portable phone with instructions in about forty minutes. One person only or I'd go with you. They were very clear on that: one person only.  What happened to your jaw?
This is our concern, Dude.
Jesus fucking Christ.
Can we just rent it from you?
They range up to three thousand.
Yeah, well, what do you care, Walter?
What's a pederast, Walter?
This Saturday.  Quintana and--
How come you don't roll on Saturday, Walter?
And then they're gonna stamp on it?!
Am I wrong?
What do you need that for, Dude?
Those are good burgers, Walter.
Who's in pyjamas, Walter?
--So he says, "My son can't hold a job, my daughter's married to a fuckin' loser, and I got a rash on my ass so bad I can't hardly siddown. But you know me.  I can't complain."
That is indeed Mr. Lebowski with the first lady, yes, taken when--
--without  the means  for higher education, so Mr. Lebowski  has committed  to sending  all of them to college.
Heh-heh--
Sometimes.  I wouldn't hold out much hope for the tape deck though.  Or the Creedence tapes.
Take it easy, Dude.
Of course, you do get the good with the bad.  The new technology permits us to do exciting things with interactive erotic software.  Wave of the future, Dude.  100% electronic.
No!  No!  NO!  THAT'S NOT--
Who the fuck are you, man!  Come on, man!
Brother Shamus?  Like an Irish monk?
Is that what that's a picture of?
Lord.  You can imagine where it goes from here.
Yeah, but my-
Yeah, but what about--
Well...yeah--
Tell me a little about yourself, Jeffrey.
Yeah.  Roadie for Metallica.  Speed of Sound Tour.
No no, the wealth was all Mother's.
He helps administer the charities now, and I give him a reasonable allowance.  He has no money of his own.  I know how he likes to present himself; Father's weakness is vanity. Hence the slut.
This was, uh--
What's the point of--we all know who was at fault, so what the fuck are you talking about?
So who--
I'm saying, Cynthia's Pomeranian. I'm looking after it while Cynthia and Marty Ackerman are in Hawaii.
Hey, man, if my fucking ex-wife asked me to take care of her fucking dog while she and her boyfriend went to Honolulu, I'd tell her to go fuck herself.  Why can't she board it?
Hey man--
Come on Walter, it's just--it's Smokey.  So his toe slipped over a little, it's just a game.
I'm perfectly calm, Dude.
...They  gave  Dude  a  beeper,  so whenever these guys call--
I figure it's easy money, it's all pretty harmless.  I mean she probably kidnapped herself.
Well, there isn't a literal connection, Dude.
The fucking point is--
What the hell is this?
We?  What the fuck we?  You said you just wanted to come along--
Oh shit.  Walter.
They hung up, Walter!  You fucked it up!  You fucked it up!  Her life was in our hands!
There is no fucking hand-off, Walter! At a wooden bridge we throw the money out  of the car!
The bridge is coming up!  Gimme the ringer, Dude!  Chop-chop!
Walter!
Who gives a shit, Walter?  What about that poor woman?  What do we tell--
I'll  get  you  a  toe by  this afternoon--with nail  polish. These fucking amateurs.   They send us a toe, we're  supposed to  shit our- selves with fear.  Jesus Christ. My point is--
Well that's just, that's the stress talking, Dude.  So far we have what looks to me like a series of victimless crimes--
Lady, I got buddies who died face- down in the muck so you and I could enjoy this family restaurant!
Uh-huh.
Dude, please!. . .  Is this your homework, Larry?
You're going to enter a world of pain, son.  We know that this is your homework.  We know you stole a car--
I'm saying if he knows I'm a fuck- up, then why does he still leave me in charge of getting back his wife? Because he fucking doesn't want her back, man!  He's had enough!  He no longer digs her!  It's all a show! But then, why didn't he give a shit about his million bucks?  I mean, he knew we didn't hand off his briefcase, but he never asked for it back.
And you were divorced five fucking years ago.
It's just part of your whole sick Cynthia thing.  Taking care of her fucking dog.  Going to her fucking synagogue.  You're living in the fucking past.
Sure you'll see some tank battles. But fighting in desert is very different from fighting in canopy jungle.
There weren't any shots.
We're scattering the fucking ashes!
You make everything a fucking travesty!
WHERE'S THE FUCKING MONEY, SHITHEAD!
Well sir, it's this rug I have, really tied the room together-
Come on, man, I'm not trying to scam anybody here, I'm just--
Employed?
It's funny.  I can look back on a life of achievement, on challenges met, competitors bested, obstacles overcome.  I've accomplished more than most men, and without the use of my legs.  What. . . What makes a man, Mr. Lebowski?
Huh?
Is it. . . is it, being prepared to do the right thing?  Whatever the price?  Isn't that what makes a man?
'Scuse me?
Put me down, you son of a bitch!
You monsters!
Who the hell is he?
You've been training two years to take me out.  Here I am, the big, bad vampire hunter.  So do it.
What is it with you people and pain?
What about Nomak?
Each day is a little life.
Anyone else make it?
Thank you.
You came back for me.
I agree.  We play along for now, we might wind up learning something about how their world ticks.
What do you really think?
And so will we.
It has been said, you may have enemies whom you hate, but not enemies whom you despise.  Be proud of your enemy: then his success shall be yours, too.  In that regard, I should thank you.
You want me to hunt them for you.
You got something in mind, Blade?
Motion sensors.  Looks like Zone Three.
We want to attract them, not scare them off.
Yes?
Any casualties?
Whatever --  What'd you do to the Charger?
Gave it a more aggressive exhaust profile ramping.
What took you so long?
Why not? The future of our race runs through your bloodstream. You've got the best of both worlds, Blade. All of our strengths and none of our weaknesses.
This is an old tongue, from an old world. It concerns LaMagra.
I can go to the police. I have blood samples back at the hospital. I can show them.
Like what?
What am I injecting you with?
My mother used to say that a cold heart is a dead heart.
For what it's worth, I'm sorry.
Is it bad?
Maybe it's time to start exploring other alternatives.
The red blood cells are biconvex, which is theoretically impossible. They're hypochromic, there's virtually no hemoglobin in them.  Look at the PMNs, they're binucleated, they should be mononucleated.
-- but then I remember what an ass-hole you were and I'm snapped back to reality.
There's no need for any of this. Your condition can be treated. Whistler and I were working on a cure when --
I was wrong about you, Blade. You were never one of us. You're a traitor to your race.
What -- ?
Whistler!
--or incredibly fucking naive.
I need you to talk to me, talk to me about the dreams--about James, the other boys.
What do you mean?
What happened to her, where did she go?
--stop it! Stop talking about it! I'm gonna freak!
No!
--the witch kills children--
Hang you like the witch you are, unless--
No.
That's a sapling--<u>this</u> mother's got to be three hundred years old, minimum.
What?
And what do you possibly think you're going to fucking see there?
We'll stay overnight, get a hotel--
What can I get you?
Nothing. I dunno--
Was that you laughing?
Just now?
What'd you dream?
--like you hurt the baby--
--hours before--
I know you're in there, you piece of shit!
My ass--you saw those four fucking baboons put 'em there!
I don't think it was them.
Does it hurt?
There, what? I didn't see anything.
--thank you, Heather Arendt--and arend't we glad you're here--a real witch--
Three people: two guys, a girl-- sleeping in the same motel room, the same tent night after night.
--yeah, a hand or something--
Get inside quick, they'll stop.
English.
Boy Kurth.
Who?
--it's the "Blair Witch Cult"--a copy-- some pages from--one of them on the site must've gotten my message--
Either way, maybe there's a book in it, and they both make a ton of money.
What?
403 41st Street, kids: home.
Let's get inside.
Just one lock in this neighbor- hood?
Running a junk yard.
Just hold on!
Why was <u>she</u> exempted, Nick?
Why?
What?
Ripped? They look like they were <u>bit</u> off.
What?
What?
--I know!
Heather.
What?
We are being fucked with here, someone or something.
I can't do it!
Put 'em together that's a "k." James Kurth--
"It's why the witch kills children."
Why?
Like a blueprint for disembowelment.
Then just give me one of your explanations that all three of us'll buy.
He's in a meeting. Could I have him--
--yes--
She wants me to talk to you, Heather.
I'll tell your mother not to expect you at the funeral.
Listen Meurice, you're gonna help me with a problem.
Thanks, Meurice.
Don't go to the bar, Ray. I know him, that ain't a good idea.
Uh-huh. So how do you know it was a he?
Well... the couch would be all right...
I could've sworn I heard something.
Psychiatrist said I was the healthiest person he'd ever met, so Marty fired him.
Nothing. He's like you, he doesn't say much.
Hello?
...What?
Why didn't you get into bed?
...Anyway, we got some time now. But we gotta be smart.
...Who?
...You leaving?
If he does come in I'm not here... What were you drinking, Debra?
You've got a very sophisticated palate.
...So what're you doing tonight?
It'll pass.
I reckon I can hear him. TV option, that's a dollar twenty, makes nine eighty-six plus tax.
And how many room got TV, Dusty?
Right. Friday night is Yankee night. Where're you from?
...You know that car?
...What was that back there?
Ray. Did you mean that, what you said before, or were you just being a gentleman?
Well, I don't know... Call it a fringe benefit.
...That's the test, ain't it? Test of true love--
You want me to kill 'em.
...What?
Yeah. Is it...
...What?
Yeah...
Something I got to ask you, Marty. I've been very very careful. Have you been very very careful?
No, he's off tonight. Where was he last night?
Pour that back.
What's this?
This.
Howdy stranger.
Where was I?
I think it's important not to get depressed. Depression is a terrible thing. They say it can bring on illness.
Jeffrey. you're not going down by Lincoln, are you?
Doctor Gynde. my whole family's sick. What's going on?
Will you tell Mom when she gets home from the hospital that I've gone to dinner at Sandy Williams' house?
Shit Ben! How the shit are ya?
Fuckin' good, real fuckin' good. You know this little tid bit, Dorothy, and this thing, here,  is a neighbor. What the shit we're doin' with a neighbor, I don't know. goddam!!! This is the suavest guy I know. look at you. You're one beautiful fucker, Ben. I love this jacket and that cigarette holder of yours. shit, that is too fuckin' much. Where's those glasses. this beer's gonna get too warm. I can't stand fuckin' warm beer. it makes me puke.
To your health, Frank.
See you Tuesday, Frank.
Are you Detective Williams?
Detective Williams here. yeah. Tell him to go to Sergeant Milton. yeah, copy.  Well, Jeffrey, you found something which is very interesting to us. Very interesting. I know you must be curious to know more.  But. I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you not only not to tell anyone about your find, but also not to ask more about the case. One day. when it's all sewed up, I'll let you know all the details. Right now, though. I can't.
Anything you can tell me?
Who knows you have these?
For now. Alright. you better be. And Sandy better not be involved with this, I can tell you. Be prepared to come in for further interrogation on this later.
Where are we going, Frank?
Yes, but.
Don't say PLEASE, Fuckhead. WHAT ARE THESE?
Yeah, maybe so. Frank's got me. and you. and really it's all thanks to Don. isn't it. remember that. Your husband was the one who started fucking my mind with drugs.
Jeffrey. Jeffrey what?
You tell me!! Let me see that wallet.  Jeffrey Beaumont. What're you doing in my apartment, Jeffrey Beaumont?
NO, you come on. Take off your pants. I want to see you.
Sure I'm alright. 
Yes.
Do you like me?
Next Christmas. Is he Santa Claus who has left a present for Dorothy? What was it? An ear? Another ear?!!  What was it?
It's a secret so don't tell anyone. Some day I'll show you where. I've gotta go to sleep now.
I can't. I can't. You think you know so much.
No. I should go.
Come in.
It used to make me laugh .but.
No. how could he?. Don't go. You think I'm crazy, don't you? I want you to stay.  . don't hate me.
I guess I should go.
Hold me, Don.
Hey? . You like to walk.
Come on. I wancha to meet a frienda mine. Raymond, get enough beer for Ben too.
No, I want ya to fuck it. Shit, yes. pour the fuckin' beer.
Yeah, how did you know?
What do you know about the ear?. anything?
Oh yeah. What about those other people? . Anything?
I guess so. Like you said. It's a strange world.
No. I only saw his back. He went down another stairwell at the end of the hall.
Yeah, if it opens the door.
Yes. I do.
You really want to do this, don't you?
It's crazy and dangerous. My God. I shouldn't have told you.
O.K.
. I wish you wouldn't do this.  It doesn't make any sense. Let's go somewhere and have some coffee.
Call tomorrow. It's okay. Good luck. I hope you can sneak out okay. You're going to wait until she's asleep?
You want a Dairy Queen?
Who, me? Why should it?
Okay. okay.
What am I going to do?
You know, that cheese is practically all chemicals.
I'm seeing something that was always hidden. I'm involved in a mystery. I'm learning. and it's all secret.
Everything okay?
Oh my God. What's wrong?
Probably not. no. Why?
Please get to your father and send him and the police to Dorothy's apartment right away. Be sure your father comes. Something is happening over there. They're hurting someone. the guy she loves. Tell them to hurry. I'm going over right now.
Look Jeffrey.
Hi Dad.
Looks like they've got you strapped in pretty good.
Jeffrey, breakfast is ready.
What time are visiting hours?
Well. Okay.
Yeah?
God. you scared me.
Well.
Hello. uh. my name is Jeffrey Beaumont. Is Detective Williams in?
Please excuse me a moment, Jeffrey, and I'll get to the dishes.
Mike's gotta go.  Nice to meet you.
I don't know why we have to watch T.V.
Hey come here, you stole my girl, you bastard. I'm gonna kick your ass, right in front of your stupid house.
I've been holding this shit for him for three weeks.  You tell Diego I don't appreciate it.  You tell him I want my money by Friday.  Can you do that?
Let us walk.  From what I understand, Diego has bought a hundred and sixty acres, a marina, a hotel, and an airstrip.
Three-hundred kilos is a very big load, Georgie.  Why don't we start small?
Alright.  I'll ask Pablo, tell him it's for you.  I don't think there will be a problem.
This is it for me.
Just everything.  You.  California.  The beach.  This spot right here.  I feel like I belong here, you know?  It just feels right.
Honey, your nose!
Are you sure you're okay?  You're pale.
George, I went to the doctor.  I don't have two years.
You can't sell this to your friends.
Mr. Jung, you're a convicted felon, correct?
Excuse me?
Really.  Are you getting paid, Mr. Jung?
Hmm.  I see.  Will there be clothes in the suitcase?
I demand to know everything.  I do not trust six-hundred thousand dollars of coca to someone I don't know.
Why are you speaking?
Look, I'm sorry about everything.  I feel like an idiot.  You were right.  I did fuck you.  And then Diego fucked me. Cut me out, too.
No?
I never believed you were a murderer.  I knew.  I knew you are a magico.  I have seen it in you.  It's in your spirit.
How many kilos can we fit in these planes?
Fifteen hundred.  We'll have to stop somewhere to refuel.
How are we doing?
I know.
Bad news, George.  I'm in Colombia.
Jesus Christ, George, I don't see you in two years, and you show up at my door with a hundred and ten pounds of cocaine?
Touche.
Pablo used his influence.  Now, George, watch what you say.  Everybody hears everything.  A lot of things get said and done that, well, let's just say this isn't America.  Life is cheap here, you know?  No offense, but you know what I'm saying?
Who?  I need to know.  Ah, never mind. We'll talk about it later.
I'm calling it three.
Are you comfortable with this?
And keep only forty-percent?  No thanks.
Derek Foreal.
You'd better kill me now, Diego, because you're a dead man.
Cocaine?  How much?
Well, you know.  It's um...
Tell him I don't want to see him.  Tell him he's not welcome here.
Layaway shmayaway.
Who's the cheapskate?
I like to come up here.  To make the decisions.  To be one with nature.
Freedom.
Money.
There's something out there for me, Dad. Something different.  Something free form, you know?  Something for me, and college just isn't it.
What are you going to do?
I know.
You mad at me?
So, business is going good.  I've got this import/export thing going on in Miami that's been very profitable.  With my investments...
Hi.
You hear about your old friend, Diego?
It's oregano.  You got ripped off, pal. What are you gonna do with all this?
Source?  What about Derek?
You better know what you're doing, George.  You're playing with fire.
George.  Oh, Jesus Christ, George.  Look at you.
No.  These are her first steps.  Watch her.
Alright.
You should have taken better care of me, you know?  You've been away a long time. Four years.  Say something.
Yeah.  She told me.  You walk her to school.
He wants me to testify?  Is that what he's asking me to do?
Mirtha, how are you doing?
Everything's gonna be okay, sweetheart. Don't be upset.
What are you doing here?
Well, here I am.  See?
Bye, Dad.  See you in the morning, okay?
I don't know.  Maybe California.
But I have a visitor.
You're looking at him.  We provide the plane, transportation cost, U.S. landing spot, and take it to wherever you want it to go.  You provide the pick up point in South America, and are responsible for payment.  You assume all the bust risks.  We take sixty-five percent of all transportation fees, ten percent of the gross, plus our expenses. This is not a negotiation, so if this is okay with you, we can talk further.  If not, we can forget we had this conversation.
Listen, Americano, it is very nice to meet you, but maybe we are going too fast.  You take a little and then come back.
Yeah?
Okay.  So we need a source.  Where do we start?
Nice weed, huh?
No shit, Kevin?
Smith.  Hampshire....
Twenty, forty, sixty, eighty, nine. Twenty, forty, sixty, eighty, a thousand.  It's all there.  Wow.  A hundred and twenty-eight thousand dollars.
I can't believe we're stealing a plane.
Excuse me, colonel. I have the impression that perhaps due to excessive prudence ... my colleagues continue to ask the same allusive questions, to which you can only respond in an allusive manner. I think it would be better to call things by their right names; if one means torture, then one should call it torture.
The questions have already been asked. I would only like some precise answers, that's all ...
The law is often inconvenient, colonel ...
Second name.
Why are you afraid? We've always been friends. One might even say that I brought you up ... Isn't it true, Ali?
What's happened to you?
How much are they paying you?
What ... What must I decide?
With an unloaded pistol?
What's important for me is that you let me risk my life for nothing.
I don't do that kind of thing.
Read it.
Where's Kader?
To show them to the UN, right?
Please, we just want to take a short ride. A friend of mine has never seen the Casbah.
Where were we?
Good, thank you, Corbiere... . See you tomorrow.
That proves that I was wrong. Evidently I credited you with an advantage greater than I should have.
Are you ready, colonel?
How you doin' Mister D?
Yeah -- I hear they had 'em a real dog and pony show going on up there - -  I'll tell you, sometimes white people are a real puzzle to me.  I mean, did this old guy really think he was gonna be able to keep up with a sweet little number like that?
Under the law a person cannot profit from their own wrong doing.  Since Rebecca Lawson is the sole beneficiary of the new will, if she is found guilty the will is void and Joanne Braslow could make a very good case to have the old will reinstated.
An inquiry into what?
Because he wasn't dead when she left, and even if he was, not reporting a natural death in a timely fashion isn't a crime.
Marsh's Cardiologist told me that after Marsh was diagnosed with heart disease he quit smoking, quit drinking and started exercising every day.  Does that sound like a guy who'd start shoveling cocaine up his nose?
I think I'm going to make your day.
What can we prove?
What was Mr. Marsh's physical condition prior to his death?
What induced it?
Then how did it get into his body?
Mrs. Crawford, you were Mr. Marsh's maid for nine years?
Did Miss Lawson and Mr. Marsh ever argue?
What did they argue about?
That's it.  My client doesn't have to take this crap from you.
Why would she want that?
I'll tell her but she won't take it.
Your Honor, I fail to see what Mrs Crawford's educational background has to do with this case.
Objection!
Did you use it the night Marsh died?
Do you know who Mr. Marsh was with?
How long were you Mr Marsh's personal secretary?
Tell the court about that, please.
He did everything he could to take care of his heart?
Just one last question.  What does the sign on your office door say?
I know this is a very personal subject, but could you be a little more specific?
What kind of condition are you referring to?
How did your relationship with Miss Lawson progress after the surgery?
Why not?
Why did she say she was leaving?
Why do you think she left you?
Mr. Roston I know this is difficult for you, but it's important you tell the court what she did.
What did she do next, Mr. Roston?
If you knew it was bad for you why did you do it?
She was.
-- And what did you suggest?
Dr. Wong -- what type of medicine do you practice?
Would you describe for the court what Chinese peony root looks like?
I heard him say it.
Miss Sellers, do you know Dr. Alan Paley?
What was the nature of your relationship with Dr. Paley.
What did he say?
What happened next?
What happened?
If you don't know her that well what makes you think she's capable of murder?
Who told you that?
Yes.
Yes.
And that's exactly what the jury will see when they look at me.  That's why I need a very good lawyer, Mr. Dulaney.
As it pertains to you -- not me.  Did you always know you had different... tastes?
I'm the photographer.
Hi, Frank.
Sorry.
Did you always want to be a lawyer?
You lied to me!
That's not good enough, Goddamit!
Can I see you later?
What are you going you doing?
What are they saying?
Do it quickly, Mr. Dulaney.
This is not relaxing.
Really.
Can't it wait?
Hello?... Hi Raymond.... What?... Well, I was sort of planning on... Alright... Okay, goodbye.  That was Sattler.  He thinks the D.A.'s going to file on Rebecca Lawson.  He wants me in the office tomorrow morning.
I swear -- the both of you.  Some example you set.
She sounds like quite a woman.
Frank -- I know you're busy, but Michael asked me after dinner if you were angry with him.  He wanted to know why you weren't talking to him.
Sharon, it's late.  Can we get to the point?
This isn't a courtroom.  Don't try to turn this around on me.
I know.
It's more involved than that.
No, it's not.  Now I get to pitch.
Not even if they're a dork?
Let me go!  Godammit, Frank let go!
I didn't know that Andrew was dead until Mr. Sattler called me at home that night.
Yes.
You said it in that tone! Like you were angry at me, my brother, at the world for forcing you to eat a nice lunch!
Not to mention people driving over her and doggies doing their business --
I don't mind waiting.
Well, I can help.
I do not need instructions from you to bathe!  I knew you'd do this! I knew I'd come all the way here and be shut out as usual! I came to be here for you! I didn't have to come!  Lord knows I was never much welcome in this house before. Apparently dead or alive, nothing's changed.
Explain to me again why we didn't do this in Des Moines in an air conditioned office?
I thought everything WAS arranged.
Yeah.
What?!
What's he saying now?
Wait a minute! That was thirty years after daddy. Do you think...?
I can't believe she never told me? We spoke at least once a week. How could she do that?
I had no idea it's gotten that bad, sis.
I bet mom could've helped her.
Nobody did.
Oh, this heat! Times like this I wish we took that offer from your brother and moved on up to Michigan.
Well, nobody put a gun to his head.
Madge. Please. Something's happened. I've met someone. I've fallen in love in a way I've never thought could happen my entire life. It's our last day together. I feel like I'm going to die when he leaves. Please. Help me.
Are you supposed to be in Iowa?
Well, you're pretty close. It's only about two miles from here.
There's a wonderful smell about Iowa -- very particular to this part of the country. Do you know what I mean?
Are you from Washington originally?
Oh. When did you move back?
No, I don't mind. I'm not from here. I was born in Italy.
Oh there you are.
Mind if I smoke?
Where are you staying while you're here?
Everything does. One of the laws of nature. People are always so afraid of change. But if you look at it like it's something you can count on happening, it's actually a comfort. Not many things you can count on for sure.
Feeling better?
Would you like to stay for dinner?  There aren't many choices in town and ... anyway, you'd have to eat alone. So would I.
Why did you stop?
This "... Of what I call God and fools can Nature." Who wrote that?
Francesca?
So what happened?
Do you ever regret it? The divorce, I mean.
But -- how can you just live for what you want? What about other people?
Just because someone chooses to settle down and have a family doesn't necessarily mean they're hypnotized. Just because I've never seen a gazelle stampede doesn't mean I'm asleep in the world.
I would love to come for dinner.
Listen, I have to shoot Cedar Bridge until a little after sunset. I want a few night shots. Would you like to come with me? If you're interested...
I'll pick you up.
Right now. Tell me someplace you've been -- someplace on the other side of the world. Anywhere but here.
Yes. Tell me about the day you got off the train.
I bet you could do a book.
Why do you say that?
I can't do this, honey.
Sleep all right?
Good. More coffee?  Robert, I hope you don't mind my asking, but I feel like I should.
Well, why is that up to me? You're the one who's married. You told me you have no intention of leaving your husband.
BECAUSE I CAN'T HAVE YOU!
For anyone. They'll never be able to live through the talk. Richard will never be able to. He doesn't deserve that. He hasn't hurt anyone in his life.
I don't know. Please...
No. Don't do this.
Mrs. Johnson! Mrs. Johnson! Is it true Cary Grant has proposed to you?
'Bout 4:30.
What time is it?
Now?!  It's after eleven.
Again? Maybe you should see a doctor.
I'm positive.
Franny?
Betty.
Oh my God...!
Your mother left explicit instructions that she wished to be cremated.
Well, she was very specific. She wanted her ashes to be thrown over Roseman Bridge.
Well, it was notarized, and witnessed by a Mrs. Lucy Delaney. Maybe you can ask her.
Are you nuts?
'S up?
Oh yeah, I guess this would be that space that was so perfect for a recording studio.
Damn.  That is the ugliest building I have ever seen.
You sure got a way with women, bro.  What happened up there?
Where's the gangsta of love?
We can climb out.
Don't poison your mind with that ghetto paranoia.  That's all just ways of people justifying their own failure.
That's what?
Hey, Eddie Mack don't like no wackos on his street.  Go be Rain Man on some other bitch's block.
You got a nice crib here.
No baby.  I'm serious.  Cancel that meeting.  I got more fruit that needs checking.  Come home with me now.
No?  That mean there's something more left of you than just that hungry spirit? What are you going to do now?  Kill us? Kill us all?
It's all arranged for tonight.  Eddie Mack's gonna be there.  And Offisa Korruptsky, too.
Hey Jimmy, you know Eddie Mack, don't you?
What it will be.
I don't understand it.  You were my Man. Since we was grasshoppas.  I always looked after you.  You had a piece of everything I had.
Aren't you going to join us?
I'm sorry, Momma.  Maybe next time.
It's alright, baby.
He'll kill them.  He'll kill every last one of them.
Like what?  I got a little power, sure. A touch of the shining, a little of the sight.  But no more than you do.  We're not witches.  I can't wiggle my nose or say a magic word and make him go away. Besides, maybe they deserve it.  Maybe we all do.
Are they on the radio?
How do you know?
Way I figure, everything our parents tell us is part true and part total B.S.  And our whole job is figuring out for ourselves which is which.
Lucky thing.
Here, find my hand.  The stairs are right near here.  I saw them.  Let's just walk up there.
Let me see it.
Why?  Why did you give a shit about the building?  Why did you care that we were there of all places?
Bullshit, Dad.  Don't front me.  For once.  Just tell me the truth.  I came from there, too.
No reason to get nasty.  Yeah, I've stayed in the organization.  But then again I never got the percentage you did.
What it is?  What it will be, muthafucka.
Then how'd you hear it, fool?
And damp, too.  Let's not forget damp.
Yeah right, and which ever of us is still alive at the end of the week inherits all Vincent Price's cash.
I thought you were bringing the Colonel?
"Like a heartbeat/Like a love beat." Listen to the Di Franco twins there. Just the plumbing or something, fool.
Gonna be le hot shit.  Pardon my Francais.  Dance club.  The Resurrection Brothers play there.  Heard of them?
Well, the bad news is we only made 25 bucks each.
Glenlivet, right, Gino?
The next one blows off your dick.
Caesar, I'm leaving.
Caesar, I'm serious.  This is too much.  I have to get out of here.
Just look at this mess I got to deal with.
They were early.
That doesn't make any sense.
What?
Why?  Why would Johnnie do this?
He didn't see you, did he?
Tell them!  Tell them!
What do you think we're going to do? We have to find the money.
What are you doing?
You murdered Gino!
We were in a car accident --
Tell them I'm at St. Mary's off the Kennedy, in the waiting room, but stay on the phone until I come out.
Now that's teamwork.
You know he would have done you, too.
You're helping Rajeev?
You can't kill me yet.
Yeah?
Mick, I know it's late, but there is a problem.  They haven't shown up yet.
I was buzzing, I was knocking, but I guess you couldn't hear me on account of being in the shower.
Un-fucking-believable.  I called those highway patrol dumb fucks.
Ma'am, you have to open the door.
See?  We're for real.
So this is temporary for you?
Mmmm ...  thanks, I needed this.
Yeah.
I should be going.  You can drop the cup off anytime.
I'm sorry, look, forget it.  I shouldn't have called...
Thank you so much.  You have to let me pay you something --
Okay, one drink.
How did you meet him?
We're not that different, Corky.
Caesar lives for these moments.  He tells me it's just the business, but I know it's more than that.  He likes it.  The violence.  I'll catch him in the bathroom mirror touching his scars.  He says they remind him who he his.  They're all like that. Except maybe Mickey.
Caesar is going to get the money and bring --
All you would need to keep yourself clean would be someone unconnected, someone like me.
Then what?  Exactly.
All right, now, tell me about Johnnie.
Has Caesar ever seen him?
It's getting better and better. Keep going.
What did Gino drink?
And as you do, the bottle will slip from your hands.  -- and shatter against the hardwood floor.
I had a partner and she fucked me.
Hey, Caesar!  You take care of this girl, or I find out!
Done.  We go now.
Unbelievable.  Can you believe that, Violet?
I know you will.
Yes.
She's a gypsy.  If it's a cover, it's a great one.
No.  Pursuit <u>ends</u> when we know exactly where he is.
That was two hours -- two hours to get a second opinion -- and nothing changes.  He's loose.  He's out of control.  It's very clear what needs to happen.  I have work to do.
Yes.
What is Treadstone?
Jason Bourne is dead.
Did you bring investment advice for me tonight?  It was tax shelters, wasn't it?  Swiss debenture-swaps.
You have your passport?
You are a friend of his?
Mr. Kane...  Come right in...please...have a seat.
We just picked up a job quite like the one we were bidding for you. Gorgeous boat, hundred-and-seventy- five-foot pleasure cruiser.  I think we learned a few things that might allow us to make our proposal for your job, as I said, a bit more competitive.
I'll give you ten thousand dollars to drive me to Paris.
So what's in Paris?
Okay.  Twenty thousand.  Ten now.  Ten there.
No.  No, I mean, I really don't know who I am.  I can't remember anything earlier than two weeks ago.  I'm serious.
That's what I'm saying.
-- you could put it together --
Okay, so you're a victim.
I needed a break.
You ever think maybe you have a family?
Slow down.  No, don't stop.  Just...
I should go.
See.  It's starting to come back, yeah?  You mind if I take a bath?
-- no -- Marie -- <u>no</u>! -- it's not like that --
He's dead isn't he?
But the police --
I found it.  It took six calls.  I found Kane.  I found the body.
xxxxxx.
xxxxxx
Yes.
-- Miss Kreutz, please --
-- let's check that Interpol window again --
It doesn't matter now.  We've just got to be the first ones there.  Get everybody up.  I want them all activated.
-- what're you talking about? --
-- you gotta give me more to go on --
You're American.  I thought so. From your teeth -- the dental work --
You drink rum?
...Be back.
...your ducts?
Trouble with your air-conditioning.
What have you got there?
Oh ...  Thank you very much, mother, but actually -
Aren't you a bit late? - the party started half an hour ago.
Mr. HELPMANN, what would you say to those critics who maintain that the Ministry Of Information has become too large and unwieldy ...?
And the cost of it all, Deputy Minister? Seven percent of the gross national produce ...
Thank you very much, Deputy Minister.
Thanks very much Sam.
I know he would have wanted me to help you ... And I promised your mother I'd take you onto the team at information Retrieval. But I gather that ...
Gillian Layton?
Help me!
This is all a mistake! Don't you understand?!
Please, I've got to find Jill.
Sam, your life is going wrong - let your friends tell you - Records is a dead end department, no Security Level worth a damn, it's impossible to get noticed -
Triplets.
Dr. Jaffe has pinned her ears back.
Jack!!
Sorry about that ... Mr Helpmann told me you were coming aboard - congratulations!
Terrific. I'm really glad you dropped by. Unfortunately, I don't have any time right now I've got a queue of customers to deal with - er, why don't we have a drink tonight?
Layton! Oh shit!
Christ! You do know it all!
What's she done?
Right. Er, you're not going to keep calling her Barbara, are you?
Let me try to get to her. I'll deactivate her.
Say it was a mistake.
Come off it, Jack! Of course you can check to see if she's been arrested.
It could all be coincidental.
Jack, I'm innocent! Help me.
I want to report a wrongful arrest.
Where do I get it stamped?
You think these are tits don't you?
I bet you'd like to touch them?
Ow! That hurt!
Bloody hell! Do as I say!
Alright! Alright! Alright! I'm Information Retrieval Officer -  DZ/015, and I'm arresting you for - your own good! Now start up and get moving before I hand you back to them! 
... This is amazing ... for me ... being here with you. I mean, in my dreams you ...
Yes. Ceiling. Why did you run away?
Why?
Why not?
Where are you taking me?
It does doesn't it?
Say, all wars have innocent victims.
How many terrorists have you met? Actual terrorists?
Look at that - right on time.
Security.
Yes ... but, this is real. Now, stop! 
Isn't it? Whose is it?
What a relief! I don't know what I'd do if you ever got promoted.
I've never seen a Ministry cheque before.
Is it all right about Mrs Buttle's cheque?
I know that.
Ah, yes, you're the new boy from next door, ha ha!  My name's Lime. Harvey Lime. Welcome to Expediting.
You want to take my console into your office?
Alright. There's someone I want to check out. A woman called Gillian Layton.
I know her age and distinguishing marks. But I need an address or a place of work or something
Hello, Spiro. Merry Christmas.
Is Mr Helpmann here?
What have you done with his body?
Uh ...
Really, Sam - when are you going to do something about these terrorists?
That's all right Ida ... it's just that he's such an artist. To him, cutting is so crude ... so primitive.
This is an emergency!
Put the phone down and your hands up.
A steak, please. Rare.  Mother, I need to ...
No, not at all. I mean, it's all right. It's fixed.
I mean it fixed itself.
I'm sorry, but I'm a bit of a stickler for paper work. Where would we be if we didn't follow the correct procedures?
A little precaution, sir. I've had traps set for me before now. There are people in Central Services who'd love to get their hands on Harry Tuttle.
What do they want you or?
I've never fired anyone in my life.
No, no, that's impossible.
Is she dying?
You know each other a long time?
Frank, take it easy. what happened?
Frank Pierce.
Red Death?  Tell me something, Frank--does killing your clients make good business sense to you? The kids selling that shit have no sense. They'll be taken care of, don't worry about that.
Is this what you gave Mary?
I guess I'll be going.
Twelve Young, I don't have time for your games. Now answer me or do I have to come out there myself?
All right, all right, he's been snorting that Red Death stuff. Been going for four days.
IB Bangin.
What the hell.  The next year, tiebreaker for the division, in Boston, Yanks down two to nothing, Bucky Dent steps to the plate.
Is there any chance?
It's my first cigarette in over a year.
I mean if he was dead, I could handle that.
He wants to pull that tube out. It's pretty painful--that's why they keep him sedated--but it's a good sign.
My father was a great man, you know. There was nobody he wouldn't help. You know that crazy guy Noel who I gave water to last night? He lived in our house for almost a year. A total stranger he'd do anything for, his own family though ...
Not as good as Nino's.
Five years.
I just have to relax a little. Not feel so guilty all the time.
Mary. Mary, we've got to get going.
This is not a good time.
Who is it?
I ever tell you about the time years ago I was on this ledge uptown, trying to talk this psycho inside?
No, you never listened. I was going, man, if someone on high hadn't pulled me in. I had put all I had into saving this dumbass lowlife suicidal that when he went down, there was a part of me that wanted to go with him.
Rule number one: Don't get involved with patients. Rule number two: Don't get involved with patient's daughters. You understand?
Nice though, pulling back her hood as we drive by. There's a mystery to it, then she shows you.
We're all whores, Frank. You know what I'm talking about, the way she looked at me.
Where you going?
Fourteen. We finally got him a room upstairs. Should be up there in a couple of hours.
No.
Where's Burke?
Great to be drunk. Sobriety's killing me.
Tom, where are the Band-aids? This is an ambulance, isn't it?
Where you going?
Whatja doing?
Whadda we bring?
Believe me, it always works. The simpler, the better.
We're gonna save you, Noel. You're gonna be all right.  Do it, Tom! I'll call for fucking backup, I swear!
I'm not feeling very well, Larry. I say we go back to the hospital and call it a night.
He's crazy.
Zebra, are you there? I'm holding an unconscious at First and St. Marks.
Keep it to yourself.
You're feeling good, aren't you?
This is uncomfortable for me -- because, well, I don't mean it as a knock, but we approach this differently.
No.  No.
You packing up tonight?
I don't think so.
Hold it down, okay?
You know what I...
It's Mr. Buddy Felton?
You worked at one time as Foreign Service Trainee in the State Department.
Hi.  Turn on your TV... <u>Good Morning America</u>, the <u>Morning News</u> and <u>Today</u> are all about to talk to Arnold Schwarzenegger and I think he's live on at least two of them.
I'd give anything if that were true.
They didn't hire Peter Stiller from the <u>Times</u> and he had a great audition tape.
Nine seconds.
I didn't sleep.  They're giving me less and less air time.  They don't think I'm at all anchor material.
Watch? --
Me again.  Hi.  Listen Gaddafi doesn't foam at the mouth or anything.  When you speak to him he's not at all nuts. He seems like a leader -- very impressive, self-control...that's what's so strange.
Well, whatever you think.
Tom...why don't I meet you there? I've got some last minute stuff I've got to take care of...Hey, how did you resolve your dilemma -- did you rent the tux or buy it...I knew it. How much?  Wow...Okay...See you there...
No.
What do you mean, flop sweat? -- you're making too much out of it...I'll bet you were the only one aware of it...
Stop kidding.  I want to know what happened.
I told what's his name -- Tom -- that I'd meet him.
Don't go.
Tell me the God's honest truth -- are you leaving because of me? Because if you are...
Okay.
Anyway.  I want you to think of this as...
Prepare what?  You have Saturday's news handy?
All this business of war -- do you get scared?
Okay.  I just wanted you to know.
Just when do you start, telling people?
I've got to tell Ernie...because there isn't enough time.
Did you hear what I just said -- do you have that?  Take a breath.
You know, I like Tom, because hi...
They're not really going to call security are they?
What?
...and the White House is hoping to keep a lid on it for a few days till they figure out what to do.
I wish it were you giving the story.
What if we just don't tell them anything anymore unless they let you do the story?
Okay.  And look, in the future I can call you when I have news for you. Don't feel you have to spend time with me just to get the information.  Well, that wasn't as hard to say as you thought, was it, Buddy?
How horrible.  We'll be fine.  You'll be fine.  Stay here with me -- we'll go for a drive, have some drinks, make happy plans.
I got my report card.  Three Cs, two Ds and an incomplete.
I didn't even have the chance to get really good at sports.  I wasn't bad. I thought I was starting to do interesting features but hockey is big at the station and...
One year...almost one year.
It's hard for me to advise you since you personify something that I truly think is dangerous.
I can't believe I'm really here.  No kidding.  If you're through work now --
I can't help you, sorry.  I'm not here to teach remedial reporting.
I've got another story.
It's the firs time I've seen you dressed like this.  You look so clean and pretty.
I'll wait for you till seven.
There's no gang in there -- We were the last ones.
Maybe we could just sit here -- talk a little?
Believe me, I wouldn't be doing this unless it was absolutely necessary. I have an idea for something.
I just read about it in a magazine and it affected me.
What pills did you take?  You sound more like someone on a general anesthetic.  Maybe I'd better speak to you tomorrow.
No.  Are you going to the Correspondents' Dinner on Saturday?
You okay?
Why can't I let go of this woman?
At least kiss me when you do that.
I was half hoping I wouldn't have a good time tonight.  You know why?
What?
That's not it.
Hi.  It's me.
I can't get away just yet.  I'm at Aaron's.
I'm not sure.  It seems like he had sort of a mishap on the news.
It wasn't as bad as he think, was it? -- it wasn't unprecedented or anything?
I don't know if that's absolutely necessary.
I feel terrible about what happened. What did he say?
You're lucky I came after you so you got that off your...
Ummm -- it's dumb dorm stuff but I see Tom around you a lot and this is such a small office and I'd like to see him outside of work, unless there's some reason for you to mind... in which case I just won't do anything.
The last time I was with someone we went through this awful mutual disease questionnaire but I guess it beats getting paranoid the next day.  Okay, I'll go first.  I haven't...
Are you okay?
Don't be silly.  What are you sorry about?
I just need you for another minute now, so we can shoot from behind towards me, and, um...
Not even a little bit?
Walter can I ask you something?
See you later -
Great!  What is it?
Let's see it.
Gee..twenty five dollars for something I made!
Is it murdered man?
More champagne, your majesty?
Did you hear what he said?
I know what it is to be ignored.
Are you ready?
Put it in the middle of the room!
Ah, your new head shot...  I like it, very much...
Maybe so...
Are you trying to be funny?
Murdered...man?...
Well then admit it, it's a work of genius.
Would you pose for me for free?
Yeah, can you say plagiarism?
Well that's not what I pay you for, now is it?
Look, go home and...work on something. Make another cat.
H-have a seat?
I thought I'm not supposed to sit with the customers...
Hiya Carla.
You might talk too much.
Walter...Walter listen carefully.  I don't want you to make any more statues.  Do you understand? No more statues.
I also saw the girl give you this.
But I got a feeling you're gonna cooperate with me.  Yessir, I think you and me are gonna be real good friends.  Why don't you tell me about your connection.
I didn't do nothing wrong!  That was Mayolia's!  I didn't ask her for it.  I don't know about any -
You're gonna shoot me!
Maxwell.
Hello Mayolia.
I had a salami sandwich, Mrs. Swicker.
What's wrong with you!?!
You reckless imbecile.  This place is ours for the taking and you let yourself... twelve hundred years old and you act like a child.
Nice to feel needed.
Booo!
Come on, come on, fork up the scub.
Figures.
Let me in, Pike!  I'm hungry!
Which way did she go?
What's Bobby gonna say?
You okay?
Something like that.
Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.
I am a God!  A God!
Will you guys shut up, please?
Can we have a hot dog, please, medium rare, and a cup of joe?
Hi.
Is that your car?
Things are kind of confusing.
It's weird.  I went back to my old grade school once, to the playground -- I used to hang out there all the time, playing on the swings and stuff... I went back and it was so tiny, the whole place.  I couldn't even fit on the swings.  Everything just looked so small.  I'm sorry.  I'm babbling.
Hey, Buffy...
Thanks.
Who?
In order to dance and to drink punch and to be with my friends. Comprende?
That's me.
Good thing one of us was prepared.
Bugs.
Like what?
Beverly Center.
Excuse much!  Not rude or anything.
I don't see why we have to invite everyone.
Buffy, what is your sitch?  You're acting like The Thing From Another Tax-Bracket; it's too weird.
God, where the hell did you come from?  You scared me to death.
Why?
Chosen to go to the graveyard?  Why don't you just take the first runner up, okay?
Time to do what?
Does Elvis talk to you?  Tell you to do things?  Do you see spots?
I was a slave.
Ow.
They can't come in, right?  Unless you invite them.  Is that true?
Here?
Put your head back.
Toasty.  Were there ever any, like, famous vampires?
If I say 'no' does that make me a bad person?
Nice conversationalist!  Yeah, I felt 'em a little, but I ain't due for two weeks since you're so excited about the subject.
You are such a wet.
A wet!  Didn't I just kill that vampire?  I think I did.  I didn't see you killing any vampires.  You were too busy playing 'Beat the Clock'.
Aren't I, like the chosen one?  The one and only?  The Grand High Poobah and doesn't that mean you have to be nice to me?  Like, ever?
And why are you always wearing black? It's so down.  It's totally not your color.  I don't think you have a color.
So, basically, I've got the life expectancy of a zit, right?
How can you keep doing this?
There isn't time.
Football is my life.
None of the other girls ever gave me this much trouble.
Cool.  We can figure decorations and stuff.
Come one, that was so weird.
-- like she's gonna kill me.
You guys blow.  I'm waiting on Cassandra.  She's gonna help me with my history.
So very much.
What... are you?
The don't.  You kind of wish they would, though.
God!  Take a chill lozenge.
Environment.  That's cool with me.
Oh, yeah!
Where am I gonna find another mechanic stupid enough to work for my money?
No...  You want me to give him a message?
You said "Crash".
Yeah maybe you're right.
Mmm, hmmm.  You shoulda seen how many people came to the airport to see me off.  When I got drafted first it was the happiest day of my Father's life.  He likes baseball more than I do...
This in ridiculous.  I'm a pro.
The ida originates at the right testicle and terminates at the left nostril.
You know what it feels like to throw a three hitter?  We better not fuck.
Just till I lose.
How 'bout a back rub?
I'll tuck you in.
Crash once called a woman's, uh-- pussy--y'know how the hair kinda makes a "V" shape?--
He did?
I couldn't dump my old man but maybe later I can sneak away from him...
Aw hell, let's have a quickie right here--
Well I guess this is it.
--Millie, you've got to stay out of the clubhouse.  It'll just get everybody in trouble.
You didn't get "lured".  Women never get lured.  They're too strong and powerful for that. Now say it--"I didn't get lured and I will take responsibility for my actions".
I believe in the soul, the cock, the pussy, the small of a woman's back, the hanging curve ball, high fiber, good scotch, long foreplay, show tunes, and that the novels of Thomas Pynchon are self-indulgent, overrated crap.  I believe that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone, I believe that there oughtta be a constitutional amendment outlawing astro-turf and the designated hitter, I believe in the "sweet spot", voting every election, soft core pornography, chocolate chip cookies, opening your presents on Christmas morning rather than Christmas eve, and I believe in long, slow, deep, soft, wet kisses that last for 7 days.
Wait, Crash--don't go--all I want is a date.  I'm not gonna fall in love with you or nothin'.
Damn.
I doubt that.
I crossed the street--it was the New York Yankees spring training field--tok, tok, tok, was the sound of a ball hitting a bat-- and I sat in the warm bleachers to think about my mother...  And I saw him.
I got a lotta time to hear your theories and I wanta hear every damn one of 'em...but right now I'm tired and I don't wanta think about baseball and I don't wanta think about Quantum Physics...  I don't wanta think about nothing...  I just wanta be.
Let's have a quick word of prayer, right here, to thank the Lord for all this--
Is somebody gonna go to bed with somebody or what?
No, no, no.  Put it back on and take it off slowly.
I didn't spit on you!
Call me a cocksucker and you're outta here!
How come you don't like me?
You got a Hall of Fame arm but you're pissing it away.
You don't need a quadraphonic Blaupunkt--you need a curve ball.  In the Show, everybody can hit the fastball.
You're through with one night stands?!  What do you want?
You're weird, man--I want a ice skater real bad.
If I get laid, you won't tell Annie?
"...Good Lord willing, things'll work out."
Anybody says anything bad about Millie, I'll break his neck.
C'mon, we got nothin' to fight about.
Sorry about last night.
No.  Fear and arrogance, you, hayseed, not ignorance!
Nuke--  Good luck.
Yeah, Skip, you wanted to see me?
I'd kill ya.
We fight, she gets the clown-- how's that happen?
Who you calling a "boy"?
He walked eighteen?!
Ohyeah.  I shoulda throwed a slider.  Damn, Crash, how're ya?
Jesus--what's got into Nuke?
...was gonna stop what came up next at the casino.
You were wandering around.
As far as the world was concerned Andy Stone, the head of the Teamsters' Pension Fund, was a legitimate guy.
A powerful man.
You don't have to have a license to work in a casino. All you gotta do is apply for one. The state law says you can work in a casino while they're processing your application. They got a ten-year backlog.
Why would they want to find out? We're puttin' a hundred million into this desert here. Why would they want to lock us out?  And besides, they'll never find out. All you gotta do is keep changing your job title. Like, uh, from Casino Executive to Food and Beverage Chairman. And what happens it, they take your application, they put it at the bottom of the pile. I know guys workin' there for thirty years, don't have a license.
Even after a little vacation, they hassled him at the airport.
...stupid things.
...been right, but who knows?
No, you're not calm.
Yeah, I don't want her in there more than a few more minutes.
Stop -
Okay.
M- Uh, Mr. and Mrs. Rothstein?
No, tha-that's good. It's just unusual. To tell you the truth, so many of my clients don't.
But it's in the desert where lots of the town's problems are solved.
If he does it again, he's out for good. I don't care what it is, Nick, I'm gonna ha- I'll - I'll never let him in the place again.
I'm - I'm hearin' things from security. They're all ex-cops. The Sheriff's lookin' to bust your balls. They want to put you in the Black Book.
' ...detrimental to gaming. And he will be ejected from any casino in Las Vegas...  and the casinos can be fined as much as a hundred thousand every time he shows up.'  Do you believe this shit?
- no matter where he was or what he was doing, he always went home to make breakfast for his son, Nicky- Boy.
Yeah, forget about your fuckin' license. I plant my own flag out here, you ain't gonna need a fuckin' license.  You know, I don't know what it is, Sammy, but the more I talk to you, the more I feel like you just don't wanna go along with me, is that it?
Just say so.
That's all taken out of context. Okay.
What happened to me? What happened to you?
My wife?
Now, what does she have to do with all this?
Please...
Ju-just stay away from her. It's none of your business, okay? There are certain things you don't do, and you know that.
You're makin' a big fuckin' spectacle of yourself.
Nicky, Nicky, you're not listenin' to me. I'm here to help you. What's the matter with you?  You're gonna bury us both.
I just told you. She called me.
I know. Why didn't you come to me? I mean, this is family, it ain't business. Meanwhile, you make calls back home. Sammy, it makes us look bad out here, you know what I mean? Back and forth, this one and that one, and, in the meantime, she's gone anyway. Am I right?
How'd you know I was here?
Are, uh -  - are we certain that you want the Gamin' Control Board eyeballin' your record and your gangster pals like Nicky Santoro?
Well, could there be any position... further down the trough?
Seven o'clock?
This is Jennifer and Nick. They're dear friends of mine.
Legally, she can't take that stuff. Legally, she can't take the stuff.
Half of everything is mine.
Well, sir, I was just...
It's always been our policy -
He's juiced in. He's the County Commissioner's cousin.
I had dozens of politicians and state officials comin' through that place every week.
This woman's an institution.
Yeah, Billy Sherbert, please. Put him on.
Okay, thank you for asking.
If it doesn't work out. You know, if it doesn't play out, then what happens to me?
Want to go? Let's go back in.
You're kidding? My God. What is it?
Oh, it's so soft.
So, do you think it's too much if I wear these in the same day?
Come on. Can I keep this one in the house?
Huh?
I didn't take your pills.
I was just tryin' to help him. It's not like I'm sleeping with the guy!
It's okay.  Look...  ...you gotta get a hold of yourself.
Yes, you do. It's very discreet. There's no names in the papers. You don't have to worry about any of that stuff.
What about the money? Uh, where's the box?
...I-I... made some mistakes and I spent some money.
...the rest of the two million is still there?
With the money.
Twenty-five thousand for clothes.
Yes, I want to kill you! I hate your fuckin' guts!
You're lower than a dog!
Yeah, no kidding. Good! It opens at 9 a.m. Be there!
She had the same.
I mean, it could get us both killed.
I'll sign anything you want me to sign, okay?
Get - Get up! Get up!
You make me sick, you fuck. Once a fuckin' hooker, always a hooker.
Who knows what you're gonna do in there? I don't want you -
...and hypocrisy.
...stunned commissioners into the hallway, where he continued his harangue until his own lawyers and friends urged him to leave.
...Well, I've got a large family.
Well...
Yeah, okay.
All right, I will, I will.
I do understand that. I'll get right on it. And thank you.
Three fuckin' jackpots in twenty minutes? Why didn't you pull the machines? Why didn't you call me?
You - Wait! You didn't see that you were being set up on the second win?
I just wanna get out of here.
I don't want to go to Europe.
You gotta go back out there.
You need to understand, and I - I'm sure you do... that in a venture of this kind, you have to be prepared to take some kind of loss.
So I put some of the money into legitimate deals with Charlie Clark. He was Ace's banker.
Yeah, least you could do is return my phone calls, though.
Yeah.  I think I want my money back.
No, you can, you can.  You've been so nice to me.
All right. Okay, okay.
Now go out there and show your dad what you can do.
I think, you know, maybe he went across the street or somewhere else or somethin'. I don't know.
Artie!
We're placing you under arrest for aiding and abetting -
...I want all the names of all the other people he had with him. And I don't care what you have to do to him to get 'em. You understand?
But back then the bosses didn't give a fuck about whether he enjoyed himself of not. To them, he was a cash register. All they had to do was ring the bell and take the money. Especially Remo, who was a fuckin' degenerate gambler who always lost.
Hey, Nick. Vien acca. [Italian- American slang for 'Come here']
Not like your fuckin' friends out there, that... without brains.  Okay?
Fine.
Hi, Jennifer.
I never see - You know, I never seen him act like that with anybody else. I think he's crazy about you. I mean, he really loves you. He does.
Sure.
Well, there you go. But what does that tell ya? A million dollars in jewelry. Does that tell you the guy is crazy about you, or what?
He didn't have to hit him. It's not exactly like I'm sleepin' with the guy! And he makes me sneak around to see my own friends! What the fuck is that all about?
You just relax. Nobody's killin' anybody, do you hear?
You just relax, and call me back here in exactly an hour, on this phone, and I'll see what I can do.
Tell me what you were gonna say. Go ahead.
He hates my fuckin' guts.
I do. I need a new sponsor.
Yeah.
Nicky, please...
So, what'd you say to that fuckin' jerk anyway?
...same outfit.
What do you mean, 'What's the matter?' I made a lot of money for you. I want my cut.
Bub-ut, baby, do you know that I love you too?
- with stupid braces on your teeth.
You're not gonna drive. Don't even think you're gonna drive.
...you big fuckin' hick, you. Come here. Come here. Get him up. Come here.
Yeah, but they're complaining.
They're havin' a good time too.
He asked me again about you and the Jew's wife.
Who's this guy? Who's this guy?
Yeah, but I'm not sure yet.
Calm down, calm down. Shh!
You're gonna fuckin' kill her. Take it easy.
Listen to me, Anthony. I got your head in a fuckin' vise. I'm gonna squash your fuckin' head like a grapefruit if you don't give me a name. Don't make me have to do this, please. Come on. Don't make me be a bad guy. Come on.
Oh, God! Give me the fuckin' name!
Tony.
How you doin'?
...this, uh, this Commission is prepared to act on a motion denying the Rothstein application.
Hey! Oh!
What's the matter with you?
There's a lot of people here.
That's enough.
You'll get a heart attack like that.
Yes, uh...
I'm not going to worry about it. We are quite beyond the computer disc. Everything will be over within the next hour or so.
No, in art. I try not bring up women around Kincaid. It's a sore spot between us. Long story..
I checked out your stuff at the library.  Awesome work, really. Why would someone like you want to go out with a...with a..what exactly am I, again?
I'm sorry I went off like that, I get passionate. I--I guess I'm a passionate person. One of those things I had forgotten.  When you were a little boy did you want to grow up to be a superhero?
Fine. You're angry. Don't be. The important thing is we're together now..
Exactly. I don't know what I'd do without you.
Hmm. Not bad.
No-o. You know, questions like that don't help your cause--
Quite a pair we make. Thank you, Jeff.
This ring belonged to my sister. I'd love for you to...
I thought you said you weren't a very good liar.
A bit on the suspicious side, don't you think?
You're kidding.
You're right, I wasn't looking to fall in love with a casino worker. I'd given up trying to find anyone. But there was a fire in your eyes that cut right through the air conditioning and through the coldness of my heart.
I've been looking for you.
God, can you hear me!
Oh Honey, it's so much better when we do it without the helmet.
Oh, I wish they wouldn't feed him like that.
Well, you don't see that everyday. Somebody tell me what's the deal with Frida Kahlo here?
A superhero's job is to protect society.  Don't blame me if society is a horrible, corrupt joke.
Yes. I am the reporter or the architect.  You've been through so much..It looks like you've used up all nine of your lives...
Can't you understand--I got tired of being a woman. I wanted the respect that only a cape, boots, chestplate, and a mechanical spear can bring..
I heard what you said, Spooky. I can't believe he shot you...
Sorry, I get carried away. Once I become interested in someone, I can't stop trying to figure them out...Amnesia victims are challenging..
How much?
Good morning.
I'm afraid last night was the last straw of our city's tourists. The Mayor, in his finite wisdom, is throwing a "Month of the Woman" luncheon ball for the public this afternoon to try and calm everyone down. I thought maybe you and I could...
I give up. I give up.--I can't figure you out. Not gonna try.
You know, now that I hear myself tell it, I'm thinking maybe both of you are messing with me. What, you get the Helmet Monday through Thursday, then Brock takes it for the weekend...
Oh Mommy, you're embarrassing me.
I'll take your abuse, but it's way too early for the sanctimonious Cult of Gag...
Mom?  Oh Mom, I messed up...
They're going to attack Frank's Fun Palace!
But I'm not a hero. I'm nobody's heroine..I'm nothing. You've said so yourself many times.
Hey Buddy!  Can you let me pull over?  Give me some space to pull over.
Was someone in an accident?
Be careful.  There were people in that crosswalk.
Have you got to tell her your life story?
She can't!  It's busted.  Now hand that on back!
Will you two cut it out?
He's right, Theo.  She might not be around to back up your story. You could end up in the middle of this.
I know you feel awful but it's not your responsibility.
It was the fugitive in the Chrysler that caused this.  We were trying to overtake him.
We've already got an ambulance on the way.  Don't try to get out.
Nels reporting in.  Sit down where you are.  Arms folded.
In case you crapped out it was my job to go after that briefcase.
Yeah, I suppose getting whacked has got to be one of your best ways to die.  Particularly if you're not expecting it.  You don't know what hit you.
First off, this Mr. Chow Yen doesn't speak a lot of English. The girl with him will interpret. There will be a third person to accompany you into the men's room where you can take count.  I hope you know Krugerands better than they know a <u>Hockney</u>.
I thought you said you could handle him.
Lady, try making some sense.
Sure.  And they left you upstairs to make phone calls?
You're the one who's not to be believed.
I don't want to know --
Oh man.  These people mean business.
No don't.  You could lose me for good.  Don't go through that tunnel.
Fine, no tunnel.  Are you still with me?  Hello?
I'm with two friends now.
Will you please speak to me! Theo?
I kind of dropped them off.  They were getting on my nerves.
What do you think I'm doing?  I'm on my way to the school like you wanted.
I sure as hell got my wish.  She doesn't exist.  So maybe you reached the appropriate person after all.
What do you do for a living?
Make a right.  You can't miss it.
He's copying down my license -- for all the good it'll do him.
I should've put them out of the car and come sooner!
You're doing what you can.  Why's all this money stashed?
Yeah, sure that's me.  Ask anybody.
Did you jiggle the phone?
They dragged me downstairs.  I thought they were going to kill me.
What did you do?
They wrapped tape around my wrists and ankles.
He's in back.  Lying face down. They haven't hurt him anymore -- but he was crying.  I never heard Jack cry before --
Lenore -- you promised you'd follow instructions.  We're almost there.  Simply get out when they slide the van open and walk to me.
Rachel -- Oh my God.
Rachel was terrified when I left her.  I could see it in her eyes.
Now I have -- it's a long story.
He had a gun.  I have it now.
You're not Lenore Oberfeld.
Damned if I know.
Not all.  They already have a third.  The question is how much of that are they willing to give to get you back?
I guess I ought to stop seeing woman as victims.
Only in the leg or the thigh. You'd live but you just wouldn't wear shorts.
Did you hear that?
Do you think they'll walk away?
Who'd ever think, to look at you?
You've had a lot of fun with me today.  What would you have done if I hadn't responded to your call?
What's really on your wicked little mind?
Maybe your friends already accomplished that chore for us.
Exactly who was this Oberfeld?
My fence in San Francisco ... 305-4410.  Maurice.  Don't take less than a third on the face value of those bonds.
You're walking away with a clear fifty percent and a guarantee nobody can afford to I.D. you.
There's no loyalty at the expense of my own ass.
It's in the process.
Her husband said there'd be one million eight.  So nine hundred to you.
Stop the crying.
Yeah.  Why don't we?
Who am I talking to?
From what I can see you're a pretty fair wheelman.  There's a hairpin coming up -- that's the place for it. The cops'll plow right into you.
Who's this?
Not without the name of the contact who can discount the bonds.  I may need to pry that information out of her.  What do you stand to gain?
How far off are you?
Probably as close to the Getty as I'll ever come.  Unless you care to be my "patron," Nels.  You wouldn't be the first successful thief to become a patron of the arts.
Don't be afraid to say hello. Your friend with the recent transplant is in no condition to deliver that briefcase.  So I've taken on the task.
If you've already killed her that's fine.  I'll keep the bonds and the cash.  We got nothing to discuss.
I thought so.
You sure know how to take a lot of punishment.
Scottish?
It takes all types.
Just cut his hair, you know.
What you think?
Now he can look.... Ask him does he like his hair, Col.
He's back, Col
Thank you.
Sure, Dave --
Look, I'm sorry.
Do it on your own time, Paddy.
How much did that frame cost, Mr. Franknum?
I'm sure you do, Mr. Deveroux.
That should make her happy.
What was that all about?
Perform?
Now, if you asked me to meet you tomorrow, it would really drive him insane.
Give me that look again.
Now's the time you're meant to do something, isn't it?
You got a special friend, Jimmy?
He lived here with you?
You want to know how I kissed him?
Shouldn't you be in mourning?
So what do you want with me, Jimmy?
What does that mean?
You mean that?
Why?
Why?
You're something else, Dil, you know that?
Sure I do.
How?
Will you meet me again?
No. Can't pretend that much.
Should have stayed a girl.
What?
So I got it wrong, then.
Don't.
Come on.
Dil, this is Jude.
It's her, isn't it?
She's the thing you had to tell me.
What you doing, Jimmy?
You said anything, Dil
So it's true, then?
Dil! Dil! What the fuck are you doing here?
Told you to stay in the hotel!
Come on...
You got to forget you ever saw me, Dil.
What?
Died...
Wondered why you came on to me like that when you gave me the look.
More endearments.
What's Fergus?
Dil!!!
Yes.
Yes. Now.
Promise?
Got you the multivitamins and the iron tablets, hon --
Fergus. Fergus my love, light of my life - -
Yeah. Just checking. He being nice to you, Dil?
That's good. I'm glad. Young love, as they say.
Hey -- what's he like?
Have a look at him.
What was it, Fergus? Did you blow the gaff on us or did you just fuck up?
We've got some plans here. And we'll need a Mister Nobody to execute them.
You a handyman, Fergie?
Give him a cup of tea.
What the fuck is this?
So it was you all the time.
Thank God for that.
Eat something, would you?
I seen your fucking face.
You're the one about five ten with the killer smile and the baby face.
What's that?
No?
C'mere.
No?
Best game in the world.
Never.
So what's that supposed to mean?
You lack imagination, Fergus. Think of something more alluring.
Who's Dil?
You liked her?
What?
Take the whole lot. I won't need it.
Like the one about the frog?
When I was a child...
Take the hood off, Fergus --
Faster than cricket?
What?
See, if we took the hood off, we'd have to shoot you. As it is, you've got a fifty-fifty chance.
You're crazy. Don't let him, Peter.
Leave him alone, Peter. He's in love.
That fucker's dead --
What are you talking about?
I could eat a horse.
What's the matter?
I know why you're not taken -- no one can catch up with you.
If the police find him first they're not very likely to turn over a quarter of a million dollars to us, are they?
It still doesn't make sense, but it isn't worth any quarter of a million either. Have we forgotten anything?
Go to bed. You've got to be at work in the morning. There's nothing more we can do tonight.
Grandpierre asked me about an appointment Charles had -- on the day he was killed.
Of course there is!
But Charles' appointment was last week, not --
But I didn't kill anybody.
Reggie -- please believe me!
Never mind -- I'll go by myself.
Have some, please. I've got...  ...liverwurst -- liverwurst -- chicken and -- liverwurst.
I'm not an agent, Mrs. Lampert -- I'm an administrator -- a desk jockey -- trying to run a bureau of overworked men with under-allocated funds. Congress seems to think that all a spy needs --
That's impossible. You're the only one who could have it.
Why not?
Where are you now -- can you meet me? Do you know Les Halles?
He has a gun, Mr. Bartholomew -- I saw it.
No, what?
Carson?
Have you any idea what these things cost over here?
C.I.A., Mrs. Lampert. We're an extension of the wartime O.S.S. It was our money and we want it back.
I don't know -- but I think you'd better find out, don't you?
You're in an ideal position -- he trusts you.  Besides, you said yourself, women make the best spies.
Yes -- and he was there, too -- a little fatter now -- and less hair -- but it's the same one.
No.
Well, of all the mean, rotten, contemptible, crooked --
Then how do I know this is your office?
Starting with his own.
Brian Cruikshank -- it would serve me right if I got stuck with that one.
Is there a Mrs. Cruikshank?
Only if you can prove to me that you're really Brian Cruikshank.
Quit stalling -- I want to see some identification -- now!
How long do you intend -- ?
Not my room!
It's the only name I've got. How about you?
Well, you know now, so please tell me who you are.
Does it hurt?
Ha ha. You could at least tell me what your first name is these days.
Is there a Mrs. Dyle?
I'm not fifteen.
But I'm not through complaining yet.
I think Tex did it.
Women. You know, I can't help feeling rather sorry for Scobie.  Wouldn't it be nice if we were like that?
Yes, I know.
Reggie -- open the door.
Okay. Then get set for the story of my life -- not that it would ever make the best-seller list.
Are you going to listen?
Forty-five thousand.
I'm -- I'm sorry.
What for? If it's not here, why bother him?
You think that mebbe we're fishin' the wrong stream?
You don't s'pose one o' us has it, like the man said -- I mean, that'd be pretty distasteful -- us bein' vet'rans o' the same war 'n' all.
Didn't Charles tell you, Mrs. Lampert?
You loved him?
He was American?
Besides yourself, who is his nearest relation?
One wallet containing four thousand francs -- one agenda --  -- his last notation was made yesterday -- Thursday --  "Five p.m. -- Jardin des Champs- Elys?es"  Why there?
Did you?
No -- in my room.
Yes, of course -- but if you went back and wrote me a letter --
Swell -- only this man doesn't have a garden.
I hope I don't find any little hairy things living up here -- wait! There is something! If I can just -- yes, I'm getting it -- a case of some sort -- it's heavy.
Clever fellow -- almost missed me.
Good for you.
Well, you're honest, anyway.
Yes, but we're divorced.
Shakespeare never said that.
It's terrible -- you just made it up.
Are you in the book?
What are you doing here?
Instant divorce you mean?
You mean you and me?
What was it?
Nothing. Good night.
Peter -- are you all right?
I'm so hungry I could faint.  I've -- I've gotten your suit all wet.
I don't -- but as long as they think you have the money, or know where it is, or have it without knowing where it is, or don't even know you have it --
You mustn't let what he said bother you. It was only words.
Charlie had no call to handling it this-a-way. He sure didn't. No siree.
Howdy, Miz Lampert.
You know what I want, Miz Lampert...
Can you give me one good reason why I should?
Isn't there something constructive he can do -- like start an avalanche?
Hold it -- Italy just finished. They're recognizing Great Britain.
Sylvie -- ? What are you doing here?
We took all the chances. The money belongs to us, not him!
Yeah. Chris BERRINGER WAS PARKED OUTSIDE THE WINDOW.
I think it's funny.
If I'd gone public with this yesterday Annette Michaels might be alive today.
It's almost ten o'clock.
Not much further.
I'm not.
What did you hear?
No!
Should we close down any eruption?
What are you doing?
She's not here.
St. Michael's.
She was murdered?
Ok. Should I put my bike in the back of your car?
You aren't going to the party?
We're all manipulated. From the moment we're born. The event that fatalistically shaped my life happened before I was even born.
Me? Why me?
_ Your father raped someone?
Oh nice save.
Personally I think he has a deep, almost pathological desire to corrupt you. But I suppose that's a type of love. I certainly wish someone wanted to corrupt me.
I don't know what I'm so scared of.
How do you know what to type back when they start to cyber with you.
Sandy, you have to chill out, at least two-thirds of the kids in our class are still virgins. He can't butcher all of us.
You ok?
Mark invited me to the party.
You can't tell your parents.
Especially not your dad.
I was worried about you. Did you hear about the bash?
Nobody wants to be the fourth. Please go with me.
I feel like I NEED YOU DAD'S permission just to kiss you. Jody, it's time to assert yourself To be a big girl. An individual. I'm going to this party tonight. Jimmy's my ride. Come over to my house after school. We'll go together.
I think this is a big part of growing up. It's losing your spiritual virginity. It's when you finally discover that your parents aren't anything they told you they were. They're even bigger hypocrites than your friends.
I'm making you feel like meat?
I'm scared. Three kids are dead. I want to go to this party.
Lisa Sherman?
What?
I want you to come home with me right now, Jody.
They were children of our leading citizens, stars of the football team. And she was  a loner. An angry girl that no one really liked. She'd called them 'queers'.
Who?
What?
Dylan's been telling people that Annette gave him a blow job.
Yeah I was talking about Twinkies the other day and I realized I hadn't had one in years. Then I remembered seeing you with one.
You can have both if you want.
You're so beautiful.
Maybe it won't stay in.
Aren't you worried you could die a virgin?
On our way home, a drunken driver could hit us head on and send us flying through the windshield. Terminate us instantly. We'd never experience what it means to make love.
Unfair?!

 Oh, shit.
Unbe-fucking-lievable.

Come on, Night Shift.
...yeah.  Tryin' to get most of my day done before it hits nine-...
Where do you want this stuff?
That's my business.
Since when does...
Yeah, well, Darlene didn't say anything about it to me, so tell Andy to bill her like usual and let them sort it out. Move.
...and fair...
Oh.
Sorry, man.  He's dead.
I need your truck.
No, no, no.  You don't need my truck. You need somebody else's truck...
Then you drive me to McGrud-...
Look...I got two tons of the world's nastiest ice cream sittin' in a truck that should've been retired ten years ago.  That shit will be worthless by noon.
You want cash?
I got, uh....
Damn.
...town. 
...-er.

Ah, one of them's in the back.

Get him to stand up, Night Shift.
    Elvis is on ice again.
...let live.
It was owed to me.  You stole the damn...
Holy shit...
Come on, old...
Oh, shit.
I think...
Hey, and what if we  don't make it?!
...do we?
Go, go, go, go, go.  Oh, shit.
Come on, old Pete.
Come on, old Pete.
...wanna give it a try!
Ho, ho...

Oh, Pete.  Oh, shit!  Oh, shit!
I don't want you to come anyway. 

Uh-oh.
See, now why would you do that to a man in my posi-...
I deserve a lot more than that truck! Ten years, ten years I busted my ass for that fat rat bastard.
 Yeah.
...shit.
Well, all the same.  If we get to Missoula, help me find a car.  I'd appreciate it.  Then...you can...

All right, all right.  Hey, hey.
...deal with this asshole.
A-And you  owe me...


Arlo, shut up.
Hey, hey, hey.
Oh.

Okay. 
Arlo!

Okay. 
You just can't leave that stuff with that lu-...
Go!
Oh, fuck!
Whoo!
Forty-seven.  You'd better floor it.
Stupid.
Come on.  Come on.
What?
...another way  outta here.    Hey.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
They'll meet you at the top.

 Well.
...truck that kept Elvis cool?
You.
...and-and-and truckless in the service of my country...
Thank you very much.
...-tiatin'.
It all started with our mission in Istanbul.
I was undercover as a tennis player.
Uh, he handled rackets, and I carried the balls.
Hey.
Be cool.  Be--

What'd he say?
 Just give me Elvis and I'll make sure you have enough money for a dozen ice cream trucks.
Funny situation, ain't it, Andy?

Well, that just about figures for today.
It's, uh, parked just off of Highway Thirty-Five.
Why don't you get that tub of shit Sam to...
Yeah, that's my truck.
...here.   Mason... 
No, sir.  I've never seen this guy before.
...to take any extreme measures I deem necessary...

Whoo-hoo! 

Colonel Vitelli.  We got a busted-in cold vault inside.
They were all wearing hardware.
Yes, sir.
Sweeney tells me you don't have computer confirmation?
If it works, your stock at the Pentagon will go up along with mine.  I don't think I need to mention you could use the help.
Now listen to me.
Damn you, Long!  My people are out there! Your people are out there!
...about--

Do you know what'll...
Brynner.
I can't say it's a surprise.
...maybe even Salt Lake, not to mention Casper...
Besides, how are we gonna sell something we don't have?

...comes up that road.
Dutiful citizens, you have something which I have waited years for.
Carl!  Set up the camera.
Carl, establish contact with that deputy we met earlier.  He'll be more useful now.
There.
Sir, all potential customers have been informed of the delay.  Fur-...
Dennis!
You don't think it's that bad, do you, sir?  I mean, Long's spent the last two years developing his defoliant.  The stuff can't even kill crabgrass yet.
We gotta get help.  Aw, fuck!  Damn.
Iced coffee.
Assumptions are always...
...to die for a country that's...
Because if you don't give me that cylinder, your lives will end...
Yeah, I'm listenin'.
 
No.

...-son.  Of all the days for you to show up late.  First, the idiot April calls in sick.  Then I got a bad tooth...
...-time,  remember?
Yeah?
Sir, I got Taipei grindin' on me here. How long is this supposed to ta--?
Geneva just pulled the plug.
Major, we've gotta seal that tunnel!  Major!
...tight!
Colonel, sir, who the hell is this guy?
 ...that tunnel.
That little geek is my...
I don't suppose you'd like to tell me what this is all about.
Morning, doc.  Awful early, aren't ya?

...back...

...-m-means, Mason.  
Well,  Costello's finished with the stability profile, but Abbott is still chewing on the load file.
Dr.  Long!
...any idea what's goin' on here?!
...stole a truck under arrest.
 Listen, Pappas...
 


It's too late, Mason. I've...
Negative.  Negative.
Now!  Seal that tunnel now!
I don't know how that got in the paper as a matter of fact - it surprised me it was so quick. I make an honest living.
Always?
It's why you attract a client like my daughter.
Fine, as long as you don't serve chicken that way.
Oh yes.
Very.
Why is that funny?
Yes. She's disappeared, hasn't she?
No.
Well... she's an extremely jealous person. I didn't want her to find out about the girl.
I'd like you to look at something, Mr. Cross.
An obituary column... can you read in this light?
What does this mean?
How do you do that?
How much are you worth?
You've got her? Where?
Of course I do. Where are you?
Just sitting down to supper, Jake. Care to join us?
Off the alley.
I'll just tell my wife.
I'm not.
Where did you get this material?
Thanks, Lou.
You've done well by yourself.
Congratulations.
Looking for someone.
Hollis Mulwray. You seen him?
You wouldn't happen to know the present whereabouts of the young woman.
No. It was an accident.
You really think I'm stupid, don't you, Gittes?
Mulwray was murdered and moved because somebody didn't want his body found in the ocean.
What are you talking about?
You never learn, do you, Gittes?
No.
But I thought you'd hired a private investigator.
Not that Mulwray?
I'm just trying to make a living, and I don't want to become a local Joke.
What?
So let's just drop the whole thing. Sugar?  Lemon?
Yes, Mr. Gittes?
You see, somebody went to a lot of trouble here, and I want to find out, lawsuit or no lawsuit. I'm not the one who's supposed to be caught with my pants down... so I'd like to see your husband. Unless that's a problem.
Well, that little girlfriend, she was attractive in a cheap sort of way of course.  She's disappeared. Maybe they disappeared together somewhere.
Stop it. The money's fine. It's generous but you've shortchanged me on the story.
If your husband was killed it was.  This can look like you paid me off to withhold evidence.
I don't like the word 'cheat.'
I mean I can't tell you.
For very long?
How did it happen?
Whoever's behind my husband's death, why have they gone to all this trouble?
Then it was over the water department.
Know him?
Easy, it's an innocent question.
Well, I'm only judging on the basis of one afternoon and an evening, but if that's how you go about your work, I'd say you're lucky to get through a whole day.
What about it?
What did he say?  What did he say?
Do? To who?
C'mon, Mrs. Mulwray. You've got your husband's girlfriend tied up in there!
She's too upset.
Just tell me the truth. I'm not the police. I don't care what you've done. I'm not going to hurt you, but one way or another I'm going to know.
I took your husband's Buick...  I'll return it tomorrow.
Did you get some sleep?
You know any good criminal lawyers?
I found these in your backyard... in your fish pond. They belonged to your husband, didn't they?... didn't they?
Yes positively. That's where he was drowned...
Stop it!  I'll make it easy. You were jealous, you fought, he fell, hit his head. It was an accident, but his girl is a witness. You've had to pay her off. You don't have the stomach to harm her, but you've got the money to shut her up. Yes or no?
That's good. Now what's her name?
...he had a breakdown... the dam broke... my mother died... he became a little boy... I was fifteen... he'd ask me what to eat for breakfast, what clothes to wear!... It happened... then I ran away...
Hollis came and took... care of me... after she was born... he said... he took care of her... I couldn't see her... I wanted to but I couldn't... I just want to see her once in a while... take care of her... that's all...  but I don't want her to know... I don't want her to know...
Sophie, go to the little girl's room for a minute.
Oh yeah? You pick up the watch?
Sophie... is Walsh there?... yeah, listen, pal, Escobar's going to try and book me in about five minutes... relax, I'll tell you. Wait in the office for two hours. If you don't hear from me, you and Duffy meet me at 1712 Alameda.
Hello, Miss Sessions. I don't believe we've had the pleasure.
I understand... if you could tell me who employed you, Miss Sessions. That could help us both.
...Why don't you give me your address and we can talk this over?
Who?
I'm sorry. We don't.
I wonder, is it too late for us to have a look around?
Relax, Mulvihill, glad to see you.  Do you know Claude Mulvihill here?
Mr. Gittes, sorry to keep you waiting. These staff meetings, they just go on and on.
Only when you breathe... don't tell me you're still working for Mrs. Mulwray?
Do you know me?
The L.A. River?
Gittes?... Gittes?
Yeah?... I do?
This type of investigation can be hard on your pocketbook, Mrs. Mulwray. It takes time.
Gittes.
Julian Cross worked for the water department?
He did or he didn't?
He owned the water department?
This?
What about?
Look, Jake. She gave us Mulwray's real phone number and address.
Yeah?
That right?... She used to be some looker.
She ran off to Mexico. Rumor was she was knocked up and didn't even know who the father was. Went there to get rid of it.
You understand which side the gelatin's on?
Will they really find work in Germany?
How's school?
What'd I tell you? It doesn't catch fire!
Now what can you see?
Yes, it's a girl I saw at the station.
Eh! Love...what a mystery!  I understand you, Toto...The ones with blue eyes are the most beautiful. Whatever you do, you can't make friends with them.  Eh, there's nothing to be done about it! The heavier a man is, the deeper his footprints. And if he's in love, he suffers, because he knows he's up a one-way street. Because love is a meaningless thing when a man gets it into his head to do what he wants... 
Toto, are you pulling my leg or something? How is it possible to see this television without film?
But Alfredo, what you're saying is horrifying!
My name's Salvatore...And yours?
No particular reason...  Nice day, huh? 
Father, I have sinned...
Elena!...But when...
No, Salvatore. You'd better go. It's my father.
He won't be convinced, Salvatore. He has other plans for me.
My husband...you know him.
It's the first time I've had to chance to tell the story. I never mentioned it to anybody.
But I never saw that note!  I must have covered it with my hand, without realizing it, that's the only explanation... 
No, Salvatore...there is no future. There's only the past. Even meeting last night was nothing but a dream, a beautiful dream.  We never did it when we were kids, remember?  Now that it's happened, I don't think there could have been a better ending. 
Then where's the money?
Daddy's not coming back...He's dead. 
The projector's all rusty, but I could fix it in two or three days. Give the place a good cleaning, put in some seats and bring in a projectionist and we'll show Catene in two houses.
How long's it been shut?
Mr. Bernstein, Mr. Thatcher -
That's fine, Mr. Kane.
It isn't here, Mr. Bernstein.  I'm dictating it.
Three cents.
This is all figured at three cents a copy.
You know how long it took the "Chronicle" to get that staff together?  Twenty years.
It's wonderful, Mr. Kane.  Wonderful. Wonderful.
Yes.  I thought it was a good idea. We've covered it from the news end, of course.
From before the beginning, young fellow. And now it's after the end.  Anything you want to know about him - about the paper -
That Rosebud?  Maybe some girl?  There were a lot of them back in the early days, and -
You're pretty young, Mr. -  Mr. Thompson.  A fellow will remember things you wouldn't think he'd remember. You take me.  One day, back in 1896, I was crossing over to Jersey on a ferry and as we pulled out, there was another ferry pulling in -  - and on it, there was a girl waiting to get off.  A white dress she had on - and she was carrying a white pastrol - and I only saw her for one second and she didn't see me at all - but I'll bet a month hasn't gone by since that I haven't thought of that girl.  See what I mean?  Well, so what are you doing about this "Rosebud," Mr. Thompson.
Susie?  I called her myself the day after he died.  I thought maybe somebody ought to...  She couldn't even come to the 'phone.
Sure, sure.
Thatcher!  That man was the biggest darn fool I ever met -
He finished it.  He wrote the worst notice I ever read about the girl he loved.  We ran it in every paper.
Do you, Mr. Leland?
If you thought I'd answer different from what Mr. Kane tells you - well, I wouldn't.
Not to me.  But you will let that cop go home with Mr. Kane, won't you?
Hello, Mr. Leland.
I've been a newspaperman my whole life and I don't intend -  - if it's your intention that I should continue to be harassed by this - this -  I warn you, Mr. Kane, it would go against my grain to desert you when you need me so badly - but I would feel obliged to ask that my resignation be accepted.
But there's another one still to come - the dramatic notice.
Yes, Mr. Kane.
How do you do?  I came here - and I made Mr. Kane come with me...  because I recieved this note -
What story, Mr. Rogers?
I'm sorry I sent for you, Brad - I didn't -
Almost two to one -
Charles, if you don't listen to reason, it may be too late -
Charlie, you're just excited.  You don't realize -
Ow!
You've got some on your face.
You're very easily amused.
You've been wonderful!  I can't tell you how glad I am you're here, I don't know many people and - 
Would you sing for me?
I couldn't make you see how I felt, Charlie.  I just couldn't -  I couldn't go threw with singing again. You don't know what it means to feel - to know that people - that an audience don't want you.  That if you haven't got what they want - a real voice - they just don't care about you.  Even when they're polite - and they don't laugh or get restless or - you know... They don't want you.  They just 0
I'm not just your wife, I'm a person all by myself - or I ought to be.  I was once.  Sometimes you get me to believing I never was.
Well, I'm not going to stop it.  I'm going to say exactly what I think.  You've never given me anything.  You've tried to buy me into giving you something.  You're -  - it's like you were bribing me!  That's what it's been from the first moment I met you.  No matter how much it cost you - your time, your money - that's what you've done with everybody you've ever known.  Tried to bribe them!
You'll never have another chance to hit me again.  I never knew till this minute -
Don't you realize that everybody here is going to know about this? That you've packed your bags and ordered the car and -
She doesn't know, Mrs. Kane.  She just sent it - because I made her see it wouldn't be smart for her not to send it.
You're the greatest fool I've ever known, Kane.  If it was anybody else, I'd say what's going to happen to you would be a lesson to you.  Only you're going to need more than one lesson. And you're going to get more than one lesson. 
I must refuse to allow you to continue in this vein, Mr. Kane.
Is that really your idea of how to run a newspaper?
"Enemy Armada Off Jersey Coast."  You know you haven't the slightest proof that this - this armada - is off the Jersey Coast.
Mr. Thatcher, isn't everything I've been saying in the Enquirer about the traction trust absolutely true?
Close the door, Raymond.
Oh, yes, sir.
Tired?
The "Chronicle" is a good newspaper.
Well, gentlemen, are we going to war?
It'll be our first foreign war in fifty years, Brad.  We'll cover it the way the "Hickville Gazette" covers the church social!  The names of everybody there; what they wore; what they ate; who won the prizes; who gave the prizes -  I tell you, Brad, I envy you.  By Bradford Leland, the "Enquirer's" Special Correspondent at the Front. I'm almost tempted -
Why not?
I said treason was a capital offense punishable by death -
I'd like to talk to you about that.
First of all - 
All right.
I don't think so, Brad.  We've just had word that the President is out of danger.  It seems I didn't kill him after all.
Yes.  Now, will you let me go to Chicago?
That's all right.  What are you going to do about Emily?
She can leave me.  As a matter of fact, I've already left her.  Don't worry, Brad - I'll live.
Well, let's hope it's all for the best.
Sorry, Mr. Thatcher!  What the kid needs is a good thrashing!
Sorry, Mr. Leland.
Maybe you could remember something that -
I want you to stop all this nonsense, Jim.
Charles, my name is Mr. Thatcher -
Yeah, all in crates.
Or Rosebud?  How about it, Jerry?
Hold this thing up for a week.  Two weeks if you have to...
That's the whole works, right up to date.
How did you meet him?
Are you sure?
I'd say you're about nineteen, twenty, am I right?
What's this?
Well, if it's already too late...
Jesus!
Hey, now wait a sec...
What can I say? He does weird things to me.
You can hold me down.
You might be let down. I'm not a hermaphrodite.
So where is he?
Why?
I just saw Alyssa's little sister outside. She was with Rick Derris.
I'm not pregnant.
Well... kind of, sort of?
Was I right?
No, I wasn't. Not really. I told you'd I'd been seeing other people.
Stop it. He's a nice guy.
You don't have anything to do with it.
If I'm so nuts about you, then why am I having sex with an Asian design major?
It's just the shock of seeing me after three years. Believe me, you'll get over it.
You work in a market, all right.
You mean, on a date?
Where'd he go?  I'd have thought he'd be at your side, like an obedient lapdog.
Are you open?
Well, he missed!
Pack of cigarettes.
You're late.
Want something to drink? I'm buying.
I guess it's not really fighting. She just wants me to leave here, go back to school, get some direction.
You win.
Seven months.
She was supposed to meet Brad Michaelson in a bedroom. She picked the wrong one. She had no idea I was even at the party.
The two moved to Idaho together after graduation. They raise sheep.
It takes different strokes to move the world.
Because there was a lot of good in our relationship.
You know what else I noticed in Jedi?
Now the first one they built was completed and fully operational before the Rebels destroyed it.
Well, the thing is, the first Death Star was manned by the Imperial army- storm troopers, dignitaries-the only people onboard were Imperials.
A construction job of that magnitude would require a helluva lot more manpower than the Imperial army had to offer. I'll bet there were independent contractors working on that thing: plumbers, aluminum siders, roofers.
You'll never believe what this unruly customer just said...
What's he looking for?
Perfect dozen.
Why do you do things like that? You know she's going to come back and tell the boss.
There aren't.
It's not really anyone per se, it's more of separate groupings.
So, what-you're stuck here all day?
Yes, you do. You always back down. You assume blame that isn't yours, you come in when called as opposed to enjoying your day off, you buckle like a belt.
Don't yell at me, pal.
Pull my laces tighter.
Design major.
Hockey's hockey. At least we got to play.
Bitch, bitch, bitch. You want something to drink? 
What happened to all the Gatorade?
After an exhausting game like that I can believe it.
How? When?
What!?
That's nothing compared to how my cousin Walter died.
Shut the hell up.
Stop it.
Because I never tried to suck my own dick?
He made it, hunhh?
I could never reach.
Let me borrow your car.
Can you imagine being halfway decent to the customers at least some of the time?
May I be blunt with you?
We are employees of Quick Stop Convenience and RST video, respectively. As such, we have certain responsibilities which-though it may seem cruel and unusual-does include manning our posts until closing.
You're a danger to both the dead and the living.
Now I know you're lying.
What happened to title dictates behavior?
Who eats cock?
She said she did all the work.
Have some chips; you'll feel better.
Thirty-seven.
You should shit or get off the pot.
It's true. You'll sit there and blame life for dealing a cruddy hand, never once accepting the responsibility for the way your situation is.
Am I right or what?
You were saying how you couldn't initiate change yourself, so I figured I'd help you out.
You still didn't have to choke me.
Why do you say that?
To talk to you.
It's not like I'm miles away.
To say the least.
Just the paper.
I still remember Caitlin telling us about that time you two went to that motel-the one with the mirrors and the hot tub in the room.
I'm surprised you never found out about it, Dante. Everybody in school knew-even in my class.
Pretty girl, about this girl's height- dark hair-gorgeous body?
But I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids! Hey!
Are there any balls down there?!
Pay the good man.  Don't you close soon?
Wanna come to this party tonight? There's gonna be some pussy there, man!
I work, just like you. You're more of a crook than I am, dude.
Relax brother. What I mean is that you sell the stuff in this store at the highest prices around. A dollar seventy-nine for wraps-what's that shit?
I don't know dude. That Caitlin chick's nice. But I see that Veronica girl doing shit for you all the time. She brings you food, she rubs your back... Didn't I see her change your tire one day?
Damn. She sure goes out of her way.
Oh... Can I help you?
I know. I stopped by your house and your mom said you left at like six or something.
You look bushed. What time did you get to bed?
Who's fighting? Why are you so defensive?
How do you know they're taking the right amount of change? Or even paying for what they take?
How many?
We might have; I don't remember. How many?
You've only had sex with three different people?
He requested this?
Yeah, right.
But... but you said you only had sex with three guys! You never mentioned him!
Oh my God! Why did you tell me you only slept with three guys?
How many?
The ostrich syndrome: if you don't see it...
What're you talking about?
It was only a few times...
You're damn right it's not like that! Because I won't let it be like that! You want your slut? Fine!  The slut is yours!
What are you talking about?
Yeah, but I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids!
I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids! I swear!
That doesn't sound metal.
Is he staying here?
It's probably from being around all this food every day.
You're Dante Hicks? Oh my God! I didn't even recognize you!
Really?
My man is deaf.  I'M GOING TO JOHN K'S PARTY!  Neh.
The only place I don't bring my drugs is church. And that ain't till Sunday morning.
I... I don't know what to say.
After all that I've done for that fuck! And he wants to be with that slut? Fine! He can have his slut!
I know. I've been here since eleven.
I would've went to Big Choice, but the tape I want is right there on the wall.
Next time you're like watching MTV, y' know, like flip it to the weather channel for a split second and check it out.  I mean, hey, we could be home watching some righteous pornos.
Answer the man.
C-4?
Hal's signalling he's OK.
Jessie, Jessie, copy?
Surprise me.
That was the first and last question-- now only answers. Where's the chopper?
Go on, fetch.
Jessie!  Are you alright?
Where are you, Walker?
You're gone now!  I don't climb with people I can't trust.  Why'd you come up, to prove something?
Well you were wrong! It was your weight on the line that did it--
No, buddy, it was you who dropped it!
How're ya feeling?
She's tough.
Sarah, tonight why don't you and Hal come over for dinner?
Please, can I think about this for a minute...Okay, I'm sorry, it's fine.  What do you want me to do?
There you go.
You can stop right there.
I was there, you were the only one who didn't panic.  So do everyone a favor, don't hog all the guilt.  You held on as long as you could.  Yes, everything did go wrong, starting with Hal. I mean, what was he doing up on the Tower with a girl who could barely climb?
Then turn it off, Gabe, because it doesn't get any better.
I don't understand?
Gabe, did you come back to stay?  You didn't.
If he gets up there and the weather gets as bad as it can, they'll never make it down.  He needs someone who has emergency medical training and knows every handhold on these peaks.
Frank dropped me in the west valley and I hiked.  You look frozen.  What's happening?!
That's no good. It'll be dark soon, there's no other shelter for ten miles. If they show, they'll take you too.  Why'd you have to come up here?!
Let's be creative.
You still wear the cable necklace I gave you.
Remember the first time we came up here?
It was great.
Why can't things stay the way they are...everything has to change.  What we had was perfect.
No luck?
Frank!  No, Frank!  Frank!
Take the rope.
Just kidding.
What the fuck you mean you burned it?
Where's the helicopter?
It's up there, on the Tower.
Then where the fuck is!
You and Frank get the tents, thermal clothing, and medical supplies together.
Right.
Why didn't you send the money over?
Where's the third one, Travers?
Don't give him anything.
I don't trust him.
Bring down the money or your friend's dead!
Why the hell are we wasting time here?!
What's the code, Travers?
Appreciate it.
What did you do that for?
He are here! He have arrived! Hooray!
Been cured, yeah, that was read out to us. The Inspector read all that out to us. He said it was a very good way.
Dear, dear, dear. Whatever happened to you, my boy? Mr. Alexander, now confined to a wheelchair, pushes himself away from his desk, and rolls up to Julian. The water drips off Alex's clothes. They look at each other.
Thank you very much, sir. Cheers Suddenly the thought occurs to Alex that the wine may be drugged or poisoned.
And now you, another victim of the modern age. But you can be helped. I phoned some friends while you were having a bath.
Excuse me, missus, can you please help? There's been a terrible accident. Can I please use your telephone for an ambulance?
Our brief govereet thru the letter hole was not, shall we say, satisfactory, yes?
Very kind of you, sir. Thank you very much.
Yes, sir. I suppose you might call it that, sir.
What would you like to know, sir?
It's past eight, Alex, you don't want to be late for school, son.
You've not been to school all week, son.
No time, no time, yes. Sit, sit, sit. Alex sits next to him.
The newspapers mentioned that in addition to your being conditioned against acts of sex and violence, you've inadvertently been conditioned against music.
You mean Beethoven's 9th Symphony?
All right, no more picking on Dim, brother. That's part of the new way.
And what will you do with the big, big, money? Have you not everything you need? If you need a motor-car, you pluck it from the trees. If you need pretty polly, you take it.
Good. Real horrorshow. Initiative comes to them as waits. I've taught you much, my little droogies. Now tell me what you have in mind, Georgie Boy.
She came towards me with the light like it was the like light of heavenly grace, and the first thing that flashed into my gulliver was that I would like to have her right down there on the floor with the old in-out, real savage. But quick as a shot came the sickness, like a detective that had been watching around the corner and now followed to make his arrest. Alex retching. Minister rises.
Yes, sir, and a very lovely place it is too, sir, when I wake up in the middle of the night with my pain.
Oh fine, fi. Keeping out of trouble, you know.
Hey, Dad, there's a strange fella sitting on the sofa there munchy- wunching lomticks of toast.
What about Basil? Where's my snake?
What do I want?
No, sir.
The chocolate and cigarettes you brought in - you lose that as you are now convicted. Now go over to the table and get undressed. Alex walks to table and undresses. Chief Guard moves to table with his clipboard.
Do you mean Church of England?
Do you wear any false teeth or false limbs?
Oh no, nothing of the sort.
Are you referring to the background score?
Patients who've sustained the kind of injuries you have often have dreams of this sort. It's all part of the recovery process.
How many did I get right?
Jamey Mack! Be the hokey fly! Holy Mother of God! All the Holy Angels and blessed saints in Heaven preserve us. Alex breaks away but the Tramp toddles alongside him.
I've done my best, have I not?
I don't care about the danger, Father. I just want to be good. I want for the rest of my life to be one act of goodness.
I don't understand about the whys and wherefores, Father. I only know I want to be good.
Mothballs, sir.
Very good, Chief. They inspect cells.
Shut your filthy hole, you scum!!!
D'you think we should do something?
Cram criminals together and what do you get - concentrated criminality... crime in the midst of punishment.
Well, fine... we could still look at C-Block.
Sixth is faster.
You like being a lawyer?
Listen to me!  Just listen, okay? There's a man, Vincent, he's coming to kill you!
Come on, it's been a long, shitty day. How about a break?  I'll call a tow truck myself, I swear.  I won't budge from this spot.
Right through those doors.  The man himself.
He'd come over from Queens to do the Ed Sullivan show.  After, he decides to come on up to Harlem and hang with the common folk.  That's how he was, you see.  Never forgot where he came from.  Money and fame an' all that?  Meant nothin', long as he could blow that horn.  So before you it, he's up on that stage, doin' his thing.
How do I know you'll keep your word?
One more thing.  If by some chance I get this wrong...tell Dmitri I'm sorry.
Hell, make it fifty.  Same goes for any business we have in the future.
...goddamn it, you telling me this motherfucker's whacked three of our witnesses tonight...
...this snitch of yours, what's his name, Ivan?
You guys been holding hands?
Remember that thing a few years back? That thing with the cab?
Joey Cicerno.  Dear friend and associate of my missing snitch, Ivan Petrov.  Both of whom were in bed with Dmitri.
It's nothing.
I'm sure you're very proud of Max.
I'm in town for a short time.
I got caught up at work.
I know you're out there!  Answer the goddamn call!
Max?  Maaax.  Pick up, dipshit.
He'll keep calling.
Uh, let's go to...  Hello...?
You on some kind of work plan?
You should start a union.
Why not?
Bullshit.  You probably know the light schedules, too.  Listen, I'm in town tonight on a closing.  Five stops, one night.  I gotta catch a six a.m. flight.  I got five stops to make, see some friends, collect some signatures.  Why don't you hang with me?
He fell on my cab!  From up th-th-there.
You - you killed him?
What about that?
Oh.  Oh, no.  You're kidding.  We...
I don't know any Rwandans.
Please.  Don't do anything.
I'll talk to them, I'll talk to them.
Don't take that.  Tell him to shut the fuck up.
Lenny?  You're an asshole.
I had no idea these cabs came equipped with emergency strobes.  Where's the button?  Under the dash?
Collateral damage.
But, hey, some good news.  This last one put me way ahead of schedule. We've actually got some time to kill.  Jazz?  You like jazz?
Jazz.  Music.
Let him go, Vincent.
Let's go.
Don't even think you're walking away from me.
Guy with a routine goes and breaks it? Provokes attention.  That's bad.  And that's not good...
What the fuck was <u>that?</u>
Maybe so.  Maybe she hears what you tell her.
What do <u>you</u> call it?  Ten years doesn't sound temporary to me.  I should have known it was bullshit, you're too good at what you do.
No client has ever seen my face, and I intend to keep it that way.  Besides, if he decides to put a bullet in my head, I don't wanna be there for it.
Who's Heller?
It's what I do for a living.
There you go...!
<u>I'm</u> full of shit?  You're a monument of bullshit.  You even bullshitted yourself all I am, is taking out the garbage.  Bad guys killing bad guys...
And you believe me...?
Look in the mirror.  ...piss-ant paper towels...a bottle of 409...saving up for goin' to the Comoros.  How much you got saved?
You're going too fast.
The F.B.I., the C.I.A.  You name the initials and they're down there.
Love gives you wings.  It makes you fly.  I don't even call it love.  I call it Geronimo.
She must be some girl.
What're you thinking, Jerry?
Saved you last night's, too.
I don't see the connection.
Not for years.
You switched the charts; you tell me.
You saved my life.
Uh uh, don't want <u>them</u> to see me.
Crown Victoria.  F.B.I. car.  A legitimate tail.
People more serious about their work. You know how to drive this thing or do you just like looking good in it?
You have the right to ask me certain personal questions?
So why are they after you?
Was that who I thought it was?
He's why you punish yourself.
Never mind.  You'd think I was making it up.
You haven't been bothering them, have you?
Elaborate on 'they,' okay?
Cold War's over, Jerry.
And you think Group One is at war with Group Two.
They don't break in the summer! Do you know what building is right over this spot?  Harriman Tower. Their sub-basement was flooded! He didn't die in a pool.  Call the coroner in Rhode Island!  Ask if the water in his lungs was chlorinated!
I -- It's like, I resolve to call you up 1000 times a day.  To ask you if you'll marry me in some old-fashioned way.  Everything you do is magic.
Are you okay?  I wish I hadn't told you what I did.  But I can't help the way I feel.  You don't hold that against me, do you?
We're going to Queens?
Connecticut.
Then why did you have his picture in your safe deposit box?
I don't understand.
At a horse show.
Back where?
Why?  What do these guys have to do with Ezekiel Walters?
How'd you get the picture?
I'm sorry.
Liza?
Geronimo is down.
You should think of me as Liza Sutton's guardian angel.
I'm not a violent man, Mr. Lowry. Not by nature, anyhow.  But if you hurt Liza in any way, I'll kill you.  Does that seem honorable?
And you have no idea where he lives?
A charming term.  Now, <u>why him</u>?
If you're as impressed to see me as I am to see you, you're very impressed indeed.  How's Jerry feeling this morning?
Me?  I was a minor missionary, a heretic really.  But where else could a red-blooded American boy lie, cheat, steal and kill with the sanction and blessings of the All-Highs?  Besides, now I'm trying to pay my penance.
Hmm, how about tomorrow night?
Liza, settle a bet for us.
Tell him I'm on vacation.  That I won't be back for two weeks.
I've been given a cease and desist on all matters relating to Jerry Fletcher.  We're not to discuss him with the press, the N.Y.P.D., anyone.  Building police are to arrest him on sight and we're to report any attempt he makes to contact you.
It makes perfect sense.  Field work is not our oeuvre.
Go to the northeast corner.  Call a cab.  Bring the pizza.  Then there's a poem.  Roses are red, violets are blue, if the Pope goes to Washington, I would, too.
Guy's a C.I.A. shrink.  Here to I.D. Fletcher.  They knew each other somehow.
Agent Lowry.
I'm, it really doesn't matter. Think C.I.A. and exponentiate. I'm a government employee and I've been watching Jerry for awhile.
No idea.  Honest.  What are you going to do?
He died...  ... in 1972.
Is it possible...?
Mike, because of the Earth's rotation we're only in line with Vega so many hours a day; the only way to get the whole message is to cooperate with other stations.  If Dr. Arroway hadn't moved quickly we could have lost key elements.
Hope there's a cartoon.
I'm not.  You're far too promising a scientist to waste your considerable gifts on this nonsense --
Peter sends his regards.
Very well; since my appointment he's been made interim director.
Now exactly.  It's... complicated.
Ellie...
Apparently he's genuinely interested in science.  This could be a chance to win him over.
Ms. President, this is communist paranoia right out of War of the Worlds.  There is no reason whatsoever to believe the ETIs intentions are hostile.  We pose no threat to them -- it would be like us going out of our way to destroy microbes on a beach in Africa.
David --
Do you have a minute -- ?
... And while its function remains, for the moment, a mystery, my best guess is that it represents a transport of some kind.
Mr. Rank's organization represents the point of view of tens of millions of families, Dr. Arroway. Feel free to disagree, but there won't be any suppressing of opinions here today.
What's the status of the decryption effort?
And?
Here, right around Centaurus A.
You've only searched -- what is it, sixteen hundred stars without a peep?  Try not to take it too personally.
Can't we get rid of them?
I think we just hit the cosmic jackpot.
There is no direct evidence, no.
I don't have the figures in front of me, but yes, that sounds about right.
Thank you, Doctor.  Now --
So why don't you admit what by your own standards must be the truth: that this experience simply didn't happen.
Small moves, Captain, small moves.
Talk to him.
Could we hear to the moon?
Could we hear God?
Time to sleep now, Captain.  But you can ask more questions in the morning, okay?
And they all travel here through this wormhole subway system you built.
... all those voices... you gather them all together.  Millions of intelligences in one consciousness... and now we're a part of it.
Eventually you'll get here on your own.  This was just the first step; in time you'll take another.
You live here.
I didn't realize I was out.
You've... found it.  What could I possibly have that you would want, Mr. Hadden?
A machine.  But a machine that does what?
What are you talking about?  It's over.
You sound like Joseph.  You think the world ends with the millennium?
I'd say this is slightly different.
He's an incredible prick but I never learned so much in my life.
Please.  Any chance of that died the day David Drumlin was appointed head of the N.S.F.  I have been in contact with a few other SETI people; we've been trying to find backing from private investors. I've even managed to scrounge a couple of hours of telescope time here and there...
... We've been going after some of the big multi-nationals but without much luck; got a donation from a New York dowager... We've even been thinking about selling T-shirts.
Greenbank?
And you think I don't want those things?  You think I don't stay up half the night wondering if I've made the right choice living half a world away from you, wondering if any of this is worth what I'm giving up for it everyday?  Let's get married.
That you, Valerian?
Champagne please.
... What I'm curious about are the wilderness years.  You're out there all alone, no money, mocked by the skeptics.  It must have taken tremendous faith.
And what would you have done if the odds had gone against you?
What are my other options?  In fifty years?  Never?
So.  I'm assuming they sent you here to administer last rites?
I want to, Palmer -- more than anything.  But it has to be real. It has to be true.
I don't know.  If it was a god, it was searching for a greater one.  It was still searching for meaning...
I'm not sure...  Maybe it simply exists in the search for it.  Maybe its something we have to make for ourselves.
Boss, I made an arrangement with that man to take his broom.
I'm lucky I got a broom. Work up top. Real easy job. Man, it's gonna be hot down in that ditch.
Fifty cents? Sweet job like that worth at least a buck.
You never thought that's a heavy load?
What went wrong?
Well, why not? Idee of marryin' got you all choked up, trying to pretend you was respectable you was borin' the hell out of all of us.
Go hard!
What's all this dirt in the yard?
Luke, you run again and we'll kill you.
You gonna get used to wearing them chains aftera while, Luke. But don't you never stop listenin' to them clinkin'. That's gonna remind you of what I been sayin'.
In the Navy, we used to call guys --
Only two? Man, I already done eight. Nothin' to it. Just make the days and let the weeks and the years make themselves.
Borrowin' or payin' back?
Newmeat looks like a poker player, Drag.
Oh, man, did you see her? Did you see her?
Uh-huh. And he ain't got nothing showing. Raise his head off.
Course not. He ain't in the box 'cause a the joke played on him. He's there 'cause he back sassed a Free Man. They got their rules and we ain't got nothing to do with that. Woulda probably happened to him sooner or later, to a complainer like him. He's gotta learn the rules same as anybody else.
Man, this here Newmeat parking meter bandit thing what calls itself Luke don't know nuthin' 'bout nuthin'.
Nuthin'! A handfull of nuthin'!  You stupid mullet-head. He beat you with nuthin'! Just like today when he kept coming back at me.
Why'd you have to say fifty? Why not thirty-five or thirty-nine?
Yeah, I know. But what we gotta do first is stretch that l'il ol' belly of yours -- git it all strained out, in fightin' shape, like a barrage balloon.
Sure do... that's why we didn't bet with the Navy.
Whoee, it's cold. Wisht I had somethin' to eat. Bread, grits, beans even. Soon's we get to my house, we're gonna have us one big meal and then I'm gonna show you some farm girls that...
Is that your answer, Old Man? You're a hardcase too, ain't you?
Like I always do?
What's the writing say?
I'm in.
Man, you play like a kokonut. You got to call him at least.
You can't switch 'round jobs, anyway. I figured he knew that.
Excuse me, but would you mind explaining why you're watching the lady upstairs?
You threatened to drive her downtown.  She has agoraphobia.
Oh God.  I'm really crazy.
You parked right behind him.  The one I noticed earlier.  I didn't say anything, I thought he'd leave. Just take a look.
But earlier, he was staring up here.  <u>Please</u>, Andy.
I can't, Andy.
Where have you <u>been</u>?  What happened to your wallet?
The test criteria are only part of what we look at in evaluating subjects.
He was lying.
He told me he had done two others just like it.
When he was seventeen.
I was?  How you spell that?
I never hurt nobody...
Tell me what you want me to say. Anything.
No, that's still in my jacket I was wearing.  We were supposed to meet on the docks, that number 47 wharf, 10 o'clock Friday.  He's gonna hand me 500 bucks.
Where is it?
I'll look for it, Daryll Lee.
Ah ha.  What did he want?
Where did you send the message to Peter Kurten?
Yes.  I do.  I want it to end now. Let her go.  I'll come -- just let her go.  She's not important.
No, ma'am.  This is no joke.  And neither is tying up telephone lines to police with crank calls while people in trouble are trying to get through for help.
Do you have any evidence to report, ma'am?  Do you know any of the victims...
Because of your phone calls.
Would you want to work with us on this?
I am not going to look at any more pictures.  They're like a disease. They get into my head.  I can't get them out.
Maybe that's why you can't catch him.  I <u>know</u> what she looks like -- the red-headed woman in my computer.
It's <u>anybody</u> connected to author- ity.  They write, they even knock on your door.  They're <u>fans</u>.  It thrills them to flirt with getting caught.
Who turned off the Internet computer...
Ruben's gone to look... It's banged up but it looks like a .44.  It's Son of Sam.  Is it Son of Sam?
They put  Merry <u>Saks</u> on it?!
They weren't going to show it to me?!  The arrogance!  It's my <u>life</u>!
I just thought it was so -- unprofessional.  Of you both!
A man?  I thought he was a boy.  This last Christmas was the happiest Christmas I had in the last ten years... you know why?  It was the first Christmas in six years I was not in love.  Son of a bitch <u>married men</u>!  Who cares about marriage, the bed just gets crowded and noisy?!
Maybe you should...
How many do you need to sleep. Really sheep?
Helen -- let go.  You've got to let go.
This has been the worst 48 hours of my life.  I'm going home.  I'm going to try to get drunk.
That computer's wired into INTERNET.
You and MaryJane aren't lovers.
Are you always so bold?
The problem for me is... you're in the witness category.  Know what I mean?
Don't hang up!
Open the door.  Please.
He was in my apartment!
Is Niccoletti <u>assigned</u> here?
Ruben, my God, I ought to put you on report.
Get the pictures, and casts of footprints.
Now listen up, Ruben.  You never, never, never mess with somebody <u>inside</u> the case!
We're gonna have a bunch of clapped out old hippies blissing on the Grateful Dead!  Sleeping in the park, smoking dope and sticking tulips up their ass.
There was no sperm.
I'm <U>telling</u> you.  Don't you <u>ever</u> address me publicly in that tone. You'll work what and <u>who</u> I tell you to work.
You ever reflect how this big explosion in dead women coincides with the flowering of women's lib?
Don't swear at me because we got problems.  I'm just giving you the news.  I went to a Catholic school; I'll tell you what they teach.  On the knuckles they teach.
Saks.  If he knew you did that! They're all asking me, 'what is she doing,' as it is.
I don't want the job.  Don't do that to her.  She's worked too damned hard for it.
Did you come?
Not a lot of action here.
Where's the car?
Have you seen it?
Renata tells me you're going to rent a car.
I don't think we should have come here. I'm surprised the police don't make it more difficult.
So - why the airport?
The Road Research Laboratory? Where they simulate car crashes?
Are we allowed to park here?
What does he want from you?
Why are the police taking this all so seriously?
He must have driven through a pool of blood. If the police stop you again, they may impound the car while they have the blood analyzed. Vaughan kneels beside him and inspects the smears of blood.
I need to see you, Ballard. I need to talk to you about the project.
I'm the only doctor making rounds this morning.
Patient.
What kind of place is this?
The question, Letty, is how are you feeling?
I'm a grown woman, Dr. Emlee.   I can take care of myself.
I don't need a lecture.   I care about Michael.
Look, I know he's almost through with treatment here. And, he's on medication.
First you tell me to do what I want to, then you tell me to stop.
It was just a little going-away gesture.
No, really. Tell me about the promotion.
What do you think of this one?
Things have been kind of stressful lately.
Hi, Mom.
Go on, Letty. I want to see it on you.
Fuck me.
It'll be fine.
That settles it. I'm never leaving.
Are you sure, Dear?
Mom, please.
Everyone says it's the best facility in the area for this sort of thing.
I'll see you soon.
I'm really not that hungry.
You've been so great. I just feel a lot clearer about things.
Chair, cup and ball.
A while, I guess.
Hey there. They're showing "Groundhog Day" if you...
But you're checking it out.
A small price.
We'll get caught.
Really, though. My thoughts go haywire sometimes.
I have a terrible confession.
Well?
Wow.
You've got to see the kitchen first.
Michael.
Not yet.
I'm supposed to meet the principal in half an hour.
Gosh, Letty, this is a great place.
I bombed. It's either work in the office or nothing.
Who ever said sanity was fun?
The store was busy.
Four interviews. Four no-gos.
That's OK. We can call and reschedule in the morning.
Just promise you'll love me even if I end up in a job where I have to wear a blue polyester cap.
What?
Don't upset my Mom.     Don't you upset my Mom.
I've been thinking I could try to visit you at night after work, and then there'd be more time on weekends to see...
What are we going to do?
I love you so much.
My math program. The Superintendent said he'd fund it.
No, I can't. I've already convinced both Mom and Dad to come.
I don't think so.
What are you doing?
Sure. Why?
Are you all right?
Especially now.
I had to smuggle it in here. I guess you're not really supposed to have jewelry.
You can tell me anything.  Do you want to postpone the wedding? Is it too much pressure?
Whoa. Whoa. Have really loved me? Letty, it's natural to be nervous. But we're going to work through our problems.
Of all the crazy things. I understood when you dropped out of law school. And during this whole mess, I've tried to be supportive. But, really, Letty, what can you be thinking?
Oh, none. None. I completely understand what was going on.
The Superintendent was just getting ready to leave.
It's a very nice letter. But I have to go with what's best for the students.
Okay.   Okay.    I believe you.
No. You killed her. Manager remembers you going into her room. Your fingerprints were found all over the place.
A pass.
You didn't have to kill Sophie.
No.
Daniel. Listen I'm afraid there has been a big--
I don't have it. That's why Vincent went to Chicago. They arrested him before he could bring it back.
Can I offer you something.    A drink? Coffee?
You sure? I just got a shipment of espresso from Sicily. Special blend. Can't find anything like it in the States.
Okay. I understand you're interested in one of our properties?
-- Super what?
They're gonna be what?
Oh Frankie, what's this I hear about your brother?
They knew who you were when they broke in your house?
Either you are incredibly brave, or incredibly stupid. Which one is it?
We've got a lot of people looking for us. We'd just like to go home.
And the other half?
This plane will take you to Canada. From there you can fly back to Paris.
I don't know.
For what?
Yeah.   We just go home.
No one has mentioned the part of the plan about us getting caught and going to prison.
I'm going to kill him myself!
Bring me the scissors.
Fuck you! You know I'd never go along with something like this.
It's not?
What's the big deal? It's not like I was on guard duty or something.
I'm from Belgium.
A thousand dollars?
-- you stole my cousin Enrique's car.
Yeah, French guys from France.
Well, you know, when five guys break into my house in the middle of the night, stick guns in my face, tie me up and steal from me... it does irritate me.
You know why I'm handling it very well? Because you're going to get these guys for me.
If I knew where they were you wouldn't have to find them, would you?
Can you believe that guy?    What a moron.
What'd you guys find?
Yeah. I'll come down and make a full confession later. Right now, tell me what else you found?
They don't have a wine list.
No, I didn't.
Yes.
I'm Sami.    Marcel sent me.
You know, a little of this, a little of that. I've boosted cars, stole radios, run a few scams. Right now I'm into pick-pocketing.
This kind.
I don't know.     Maybe if we did just leave --
No wonder Zammito didn't want us to walk out with this stuff. He's planning on killing Bonanno and taking over the family.
Don't tell me to be cool! We were supposed to be in and out. In and out! In the last twenty four hours we've managed to get the Mafia... the FBI... the Chicago Police Department and a group of Latin gang members after us. I haven't left out anyone, have I?  I don't think so, because we've already pissed off everyone in the fuckin' city!
Oh, man... this is bullshit!    You can't trust anyone these days.
I'll drive.
There's no reason to be abusive. You're projecting your anger on me as a defense mechanism.
How about Canada?
-- I want to be Elvis.
Why would they want us to rob the Mafia?
"Vase with twelve Sunflowers."
Fine. All of you want to be angry? Be angry... but I'm the one who took the ball and that makes it mine.
Give it to me, Sami.
How's my brother?
No.   It's mine.
I would like to thank you for your hospitality.  If you are ever in Paris here is my number.
I think we went the wrong way.
How do we know what room she's in?
You're not helping.
J&amp;B?
So, how did you get hooked up with these guys?
That's how you get to know someone.       Did it hurt when you got it?
Can't sleep?
What are you doing?
Sounds boring.
Who are you waiting for?
Why?
So, I just come by to see how you're doin'?
Yeah. I mean besides that.    They treating you all right? Food okay?
Yeah. I mean, you are my brother and... well I should have found another way of expressing my disappointment. So, I've decided to make it up to you.
What's this?
She's crazy.  You should have killed her.
Yes.
Isn't it a bit too late to be out? You've brought me the sword?
Where's your master?
And if I use them to kill you?
They wouldn't have found me if you hadn't stolen the sword.  Like a little girl, you thought stealing would be fun?  You, too, are responsible for that death.  Come with me.  You don't want to waste your life as the wife of some bureaucrat.  Denied your talent... As a master and disciple we will rule.
In that case, perhaps we could be of assistance.
Please sit.
It's heavy for such a thin piece of metal!
Exquisite!  You said it belongs to...
Yes, I am.  But I prefer the machete.  Certain moves, however, call for a sword.
I've read all about people like you. Roaming wild, beating up anyone who gets in your way!
Too bad for Meng, but it's not your fault, or Li Mu Bai's.
They forced me to marry!
Where is he now?
Without the Green Destiny, you are nothing.
Never!
Well, there used to be!  What's your name?  I'm Lo.  The Hans call me Dark Cloud.  I'm not that tall or big, but I'm quick as lightning.
Out here, you always fight for survival.  You have to be part of a gang to stand a chance.  Slowly, your gang becomes your family.  All that Dark Cloud stuff is just to scare people and make my life easier.
Mu Bai...It's been too long.
I didn't think she'd dare come back to Peking!
So I shall avenge my master's death after all.
That's not for her.  She should come to Wudan and become a disciple.
Shu Lien... The things we touch have no permanence.  My master would say... there is nothing we can hold on to in this world.  Only by letting go can we truly possess what is real.
I'll look around and catch up later.
My blood will soon reverse its flow. It's the same poison she used to kill my master.  There is no antidote.
Mu Bai, hold on.  Give me some hope...
Sir Te knows that even well-meaning people can make mistakes... that can bring ruin to themselves and their families.
Please, Sir Te, what is it?
Sir Te, can you find some excuse to invite Madam Yu and her daughter?
What in the hell... do you call that?
Talent. Hi.
Well, hello there...chocolate,
And I say I'm dead... and I move.
You died, man.  I can't believe it but here you are.  Last year, you and your girlfriend --
Thank you.  For giving a damn.
Yeah, among others.  Hey, man -- you're hit.
I was wonderin' where you'd gotten to --  Oh, Elly, honey, a cat.  Here?
At least it finally stopped raining.
Hey, Darla -- before we die of old age, how about it --?
What's going on...?
Well, how's your friend?
I want you to tell me a story, Tin-Tin.
Top Dollar, you're the only one here still wasting good air...
I believe our friend Elly call you Mister Crow.  Please acknowledge; the mike will pick you up.
No, wait, no WAIT, that's too much, man, that's like overkill, nobody can take that much, you're wasting it -- !
What the hell are you?
Do this thing and you will be vulnerable.  The blood will not return.  No powers.  No reunion.  Nothing.
You'll be alone.
Coupla more rings... 24k.
What... the hell is that?
That thing is poisonous.
Give me a break.  That guy's a wacko...
Do you know of spirit assassins? You do know the dead can rise? Properly motivated, of course.
An unexpected pleasure.
Who got himself what?
I had heard something like this.  Describe it for me.  The "hit".
You heard me.
Why not?
I read your teen beat manifesto.
Most people are morons. I mean who are you to knock what you've never experienced?
How do you know I've been with several women?
Well maybe you should get to know the person before you judge them instead of listening to some bullshit gossip.
You need help.
Gee, with an invitation like that how could a girl refuse.
You know it amazes me that someone as bright as you can be so horrible.
This is my favorite part.  Even more treacherous and dangerous than he is charming and fascinating. He has never taken a single step or spoken a single word without some dishonorable or criminal intention. Every young girl he has successfully pursued has regretted it.
The last thing I need is you going into my room searching for this while I'm away.
Shut up.
Need a lift?
How are you today?
Oh right, last night. I guess I owe you an apology.
I'm sorry, but I'm not here to be your savior.
Alright.  I want you to leave and go back to New York.
I'll leave this afternoon. Happy?
No, not at all.
I'm... I'm alright.
Somerset Maugham.
Sure. Have a good night.
Alone again.  What are you up to today?
It's weird. I actually feel good about myself. Can we do this again next week?
What?
My friend Monsieur Philipe is a friend of Florentino.
Because I'm in love with you.
Then what's wrong? I love you Annette. It's not like you have a husband, unless your married to Jesus.
I just came to say goodbye.
I'm fine. I have to get going to my friends' house.  Was it --
It's not you, it's me. I'm completely fucked up.
Why aren't you understanding?
But you knew this was important to me.
What are the boys like?
Those are my letters!
I'm in the bath, mom.
That's great.
That's so romantic. Have you responded?
Does your mother know?
So, let me get this straight. You came over to our house late last night and he forced intercourse on you.
What do I do then?
Cecile, you had an orgasm.
My father just took me on a trip to Australia.
I'm sorry that was out of line.
What are you doing?
But you said you have the worst reputation.
I think that's all the time we have for today.
This isn't a joke. Your parents spend a lot of money to send you here. I'm trying to help you.
You think you can come in here with that cute little smirk on your face and try and flirt with me. It doesn't work, Sebastian.
Greg, is that you under the covers?
Whoa!
-- really drunk and blah blah blah blah blah.
Positive.
Is she with you?
Pleased to meet you.
Hello.
What's wrong?
Oh but diddling the therapist's daughter is a challenge?
I'm not interested in the latest dating tips from Jonathan Taylor Thomas.
You don't stand a chance. Even this is out of your league.
What are the terms?
Loser.
Moving along quite well.
Any day now.
You amaze me.
I just had a nice chat with Cecile. I don't think she'll be giving you anymore problems.
Morning!
So? How'd it go last night?
Tell me all the details.
Some other time.
I'm not in the mood.
At first it was, but now it's become something bigger.
Well done.
You're too kind.
I got your message and came as quick as I could.
What about her?
I can't thank you enough.
Got me off the streets? I live on 59th and Park.
Young man, I already told you she's not here.
Yep. Then I fucked your daughter.
Did she show up?
Ronald, e-mail's for geeks and pedophiles. Be romantic. Write her another letter.
Oh, hello.
Does she go up to the Farren's often?
I love the smell of pine.
Where did you get this ring?
No dear. I don't know them, but I've heard about them.
But it won't be Christmas tomorrow.
I'd hate her to grow up like that.
All I have to do is look at Amy's eyes, blue and deep like yours.
I called not only the Boyds but the Irvings.  Neither of them received invitations.
Ollie.
Certain wishes do.
Because you didn't ask them?  I don't blame them for being angry. Why didn't you explain what happened?
These are all from me.
Just you wait!
Yes, she was afraid. She said there was someone who wanted to kill me.
Daddy?
You'll always play with me?
Oh, how beautiful!
You and I shall enjoy Christmas together. Shall I show you my Christmas gift to you?
It stands so still.
May I pet the deer?
You're going to be busy all day long, Edward.
Bad luck to see death in the snow.
Because it can't. It's dead.
She's always spying on me. She creeps into the room. She lives upstairs, yet she's always watching me - always!
I brought you a present. Merry Christmas.
My daughter, Barbara, died when she was six. That was long ago. You're only the woman who keeps care of me. I know you.
Mother! You called me by name!
...At the hour of midnight, down the road that goes through Sleepy Hollow, across the bridge, he goes galloping, galloping, always searching, always seeking
I'm lucky Jen's not like that.
No.
I mean body temperature. Do you have a fever?
PMS. What symptoms are you experiencing?
That bite healed up quickly. It's been about three weeks?
Diet and exercise, that's all there is. I'm not a big proponent of the PMS craze, but there's a book my wife mentioned called "The PMS Diet," which may be helpful.
Yeah even then look what happened: Michael Mortenson kissed you and Billy Sullivan threw a worm at me.
He's a very talented musician.
He hasn't said one word to me.
Sorry. It's just so bad lately. You're so lucky you never get PMS.
Okay, just one more stop and you'll be all set. Victoria's Secret.
I think she broke the skin.
George bit you?
Why did Gregory ask me out? I mean he's cute -- he probably just wants to pitch his screenplay idea.
I never thought of it like that. I never know what to do on dates. Do guys still pay?
He's dead? Am I bad luck or what?
So did you do it?
Geez, I wish I'd get it like that.
Oh my god, look. My arms are so hairy!
Frida, this is a bad time. We're having sex and George actually answered the phone.
Please come over. I'm begging you. What should I do with the arm? Should I call the cops or... Peter?
You're delusional. Maybe you had a bad dream and bit your lip -- so you tasted blood. And the severed arm... well I don't see it and... maybe this is all in your head.
Holy shit, I don't know.
"Paranoia, insecurity, depression, changes in vision, feelings of losing control; belief that you have a mental problem..." Nothing about turning into a werewolf.
This is from a scientist in France, Madame Sconce. "The original werewolves were females. They became werewolves on the lunar cycle because it corresponded to the woman's cycle. My suspicion is that the only cure is true love."
I tried to kill myself -- earlier. It doesn't work. I think I need silver bullets. So I got depressed and when I'm depressed I clean.
Hello?
So there I was, hanging from the edge of a bridge, when my mom said, "Son, you got into Harvard!" It took three of them to pull me back! Frida keeps eating.
You look different. I mean you look good.
Hey wait, I paid three bucks for that burger. You owe me...
Frida? I hear you talking. I know you're in there. Let me in.
Script coverage?
How about a "Man in Jeopardy" story?
I can't read any more crap. These women are all victims.
I think we should do something with strong female characters...
No. I quit. Take your lame ass ideas, your fake ass toupee, your fat ass wife and your ugly ass kids and shove them.
I wish I could help but last I saw Gregory was outside my front door.
I gotta get going. Peter gets the pillowcase out of his bag.
You wanna get some coffee?
Some decaf then? That was stupid. Obviously you said you were staying away from caffeine as a nice way of blowing me off.
No, she died when I was twelve.
We lived in northern Minnesota. She went for a walk one night and they never found her body -- just her torn apart clothes with her blood and wolf blood on them. Then the town rounded up bunch of hunters and shot all the wolves in the area.
What's wrong?
I mean we can still... whatever... Maybe I should get a towel?
You sure? It's my favorite shirt, mind if I check?
Everything okay?
Uh.... hi!
Frida. I was looking for you. You changing jobs?
You can't mean that. I'm sure your bark is worse than your bite.
I did shave... Do I seem hairy? Peter laughs.
You at least owe me the truth.
Here's a towel.
Dreams about killing usually signify feelings of guilt. You had sex last night and you feel guilty.
No, it was our first date.
No he's not. He's a courier. He picks up packages from the airport.
It's for you. Frida.
You have some weird friends. What does her thinking she's a werewolf have to do with us having the cat?
You want her sheets?
I didn't trust her. All that blood on the sheets. She may look sweet, but she could be a wolf in sheep's clothing. Something's weird.
Frida's sheets checked out fine. It was just her own blood. From her... you know.
Maybe. What about all those hairs they found on his body?
He was found nearly ripped to shreds in Central Park.
It's like some fucking monster dropped out of the sky and killed these dudes.
You think mafia hit?
What are you talking about?
What the fuck are you following me for? I'm not a suspect here.
So... they're on some cycle. The murders... Gregory... then 28 days later... Carlton.
I need something to keep me awake.
What is this place?
Lost something?
Go on.
Can't let you in...  sorry.
Jesus!  We have to get you to a doctor...
Such a joker!  Like your father.
A fanciful idea, Mister White.
I see.  The verdict, yes...
Water?
What does she say?  The woman.
If you like.
Known me for long?
Why?
How do I get there?  Tell me.
Uh --Mr. Alexander?
Is this dangerous or anything?
Holy cow.
What's with her?
Right and don't embellish.
What the hell is this?
Lots of shelters were in this bill.
Choices???
What do you think you're doing?!
Look, everything can be handled.  We'll just find a way to handle it.
Well, start by going on television and saying that he's had a mild stroke...
Yes - - and that he ought to be up and around sometime soon.
Duane's guys, but he's got them under control.
Her?... Oh -- the First Lady...  She was giving that commencement speech up in Bryn Mawr.  I managed to catch her before she left the hotel.
What about the wife?
Three years.
What do you mean by that?
Uh-oh...
So you want to go swimming?
I don't think so
Well, there's lots of places where I think you can save, but I'm not the one who's ....... I mean, I'm not the one who's not the Pres...
Oh my God...
Presence.
Dave...
Dave, the budget's a very complicated thing.  Even I don't understand it sometimes.  Now occasionally we have to make some cuts and...
Now he's making stuff up about me.
Yes, it's designed to bolster individual confidence in a previous domestic automotive purchase.
Something like what...
Yeah.
... Sometimes they do.
You mean you don't know or like -- you can't say.
You ever use it?
You're kidding.
Who?
Don't you have anything to say to me?
What?
I care about the homeless.
... How could I what?
That was quite a thing you did today.
Kind of reminds me of that thing you did back in the state legislature.
That's a secret.
I know. I'm sorry...
I saw you on T.V... at his funeral.
I missed...
I wish I had better news... Our compassion index is off seven points from the last sample and that's down eighteen on the year.  The `Cares About People Like Me' numbers are really in the toilet.  We're off twenty points from March and that was right after we raised interest rates...
Did you get someone to double for me there, out front?
Try to find someone who looks like me this time.  That last guy was a joke.
His madness....could be from shock.
Are you alright, Doc? You look... you look real bad.
We thought we were escaping here. We thought we'd found an uninhabited island. Christ! This place is a worse nightmare than anything I've seen yet!
Oh, what did I run into? A bunch o' Jesus nuts? Religiosos? Prayer won't stop a bullet from one of those storm troopers and prayer won't keep one of those monsters from eatin' your liver for lunch.
I'm gonna have this stuff sent over to the hospital...
Yeah. My stuff's all marked with red crosses so nobody gets too nosey. Meet me at the hospital after the supplies come in. Maybe we can find a place there to talk.
If you could knock out the central communications room you could foul up their whole intercom system. Then, if you move fast enough, stay ahead of 'em...without bein' able to signal each other, they might have a hard time catchin' you.
That entrance is closest to the labs and the Bee cages.
Where are you going, Tyler?
Step up here, Tyler.
So what the hell's Mutt been up to?
All I'm saying is we have to be careful. We can't get caught.
Do they go to Henley Hall?
They're townies?!
Why doesn't he let you do what you want?
God, I can't take it anymore!  If I don't have Chris, I'll kill myself.
Can you believe it?  She was gonna call me!  She invited me to a party with her!
Well hell no, Charlie, but that's not the point.  That's not the point at all!
Oh come on, Cameron, don't you get anything?
Oh God, it's over now!
But what if they see it, Nuwanda?
Anything else you'd care to rifle through, Mr. Dalton?
You know what really excites me about you?
Do you still insist that this was your idea and your idea alone?
Todd's brother is Jeffrey Anderson.
You still shouldn't have done it, Charlie.  You don't speak for the club.
Chris.  We got it.  Let's go.
You fucked up little prick!
Ginny Danburry's here.  Look for her.
carpe breastum.  Seize the breast.
Chris!
Knox, I don't believe this!
I didn't mean to make a fool of you.
Knox, you are so infuriating!
Uh-huh.
I have to go home. Chet might call.
We used to meet here on special occasions. Who would like to convene the meeting?
This was my first classroom, John, did you know that?  My first desk.
What was going on in the courtyard the other day?
A yawp?
A madman.  Perhaps he was.  What kind of madman?  Don't think!  Answer.
A sweaty-toothed madman
Excellent!  Have him act.  Give it rhythm!
Why do you do it?  I mean, with all this seize-the-day business, I'd have thought you'd be out seeing the world or something?
Neil, I know this seems impossible but you have to go to your father and show him what you're feeling.  You have to let him see who you are-  It's your only chance.
Really?  You told your father what you told me?  You let him see your passion for acting?
Are you crazy? What's wrong with that?
Any group pictures in the annual?
You know me, always taking on too much.
Weird.
I say we go tonight.  Everybody in?
But why?  Don't you understand what Keating is saying?  Don't you want to do something about it?
What?
I know that.  What's it got to do with you?
But if he said no before then...
None of what Mr. Keating has to say means shit to you, does it?
Neil, how are you gonna do this?
Todd, what's the matter?
It's not going to help us!
We don't even know if his boat is still there...you saw Billy!
Nobody's shooting nobody...come on, just let us through the hatch!
And what? These things are octopusses?
Now, where's Mulligan? Where's Vivo?
What other bunch?
I'm not a thief.
What are those things?
But what makes you think there aren't more of those...things...back there?
You don't have to be so touchy.
Self sufficient...
Like cattle...
Looking good...
You want ME to go up there?
Three minutes...I'm not back...no matter what...you go...
Where's you friend?
Joey... Which way's aft?
Can somebody tell me what the object of the exercise is here?
Because it's cool, you know, I can always take a walk or something down the beach...
Or maybe not.
I mean...where is everbody?
You tell it straight or I pull the trigger. Who are you?
What was that?
She fucked you?
She fucked us both.
Fucking women, man...
That's mustard!
Here. Here we go.  Here's to you, Nick!
Who's going?
Ammo! Get the ammo!
Who's full of shit?
They did too!
Fuckin' guy's been shooting slants, Albert! I mean, what do you think?
Let's go!!!
You're full of shit, Vince! You're so full of shit you're going to float away!
Albert! For Christ's sake... John! Wait a minute, you guys!
I got delayed. I --
I'm glad. Seriously... I'm very glad.
Nick, he's fine. He's in a hospital and they're fixing him up.
Ah. Merle. And you know Merle?
She's in back.
Get anything?
Merle? That's who we're looking for. Merle.
Sure! I got eight hundred potatoes says he goes one more... He retired, you know.
Look at that, see... Watch. Wait a minute, watch. There! D'j'u see that? D'j'u see the way he... You know what that guy is doing? That guy is squeezing her ass!
Nick! Hey, Nick!  Boy! Boy oh boy! Are you okay? You're okay, huh?
Sal.
Kind of. You didn't know?
Please! Please mister, please! This is vital I go to Saigon. This is very important. Most important.
That I must not tell you. Top secret. You see there. Topmost secret.
Linda...
I'd want to pay you... and I was thinking --
How's the trailer?
Nick?... I just want to say how sorry I am about Sal and about Merle. How... I know you loved them and I know it's not the same. I mean now.
Sal... listen to me, Sal! You have to do it.
Listen to me, Sal. If you don't do it they'll put you in the pit. If they put you in the pit, Sal, you're gonna die... Sal, do you understand?
Humper's ready. Old humper's hotter'n damn hell!
Fucking A.
What do you think about?
Who's a yo-yo...? Who do you think's a yo-yo! They're all yo yo's. I mean they're all great guys, for Christ's sake, but... The point is, Nick, without you I'd hunt alone. Seriously. I would. That's what I'd do.
Is he from here?
You think we'll ever come back?
I love this fuckin' place... That sounds crazy. I know that sounds crazy, but I love this fuckin' place... If anything happens, Nick, don't leave me there. I mean it. Don't leave me... You gotta promise, Nick. You gotta promise me that.
I'm telling you, Nick, no one's going to come.
What are you, hoping?
Get off your ass, Nick. Get off your fucking ass and stand up!!!
We gotta play with more bullets.
How's Linda?
Bullshit! That's bullshit!
Here, here! This is it!
Don't worry what it says in the book.
Sal? Sal, it's me, Nick.
Did you get one?
Where?
Cynthia! Sure.
Hey, Nick, you ever do it with one of those slants?
No!
Oh, Jesus!  You're kiddin'!
Just like always! Just like it always was! Right, Nick? Am I right?
The fuck I did!!!
Looks like ya gonna take office just in time, Chief.  Things need straightening up in this city.
Talk fast.  Polls open in half an hour.
Mr. Murphy asked about you again at work yesterday.
I think he wants more than your cookies.
Who is it?
Funny guy.
You helped set up my partner, Sergeant William Wade.  I want to know who put you up to it.
Speak up.
Twenty years have passed, Wade. Lay it to rest.
You're working a partner on this.
Just got the call.  Took him from school.  Bastard nailed the Vice- Principal and a teacher.
Wade's in Cryo-Prison.
Doucet's just offed two of the jurors who put him away.  I'm rounding up the rest of them and putting them in police custody.  What's your status?
Just great.
You my partner?
No offense, but why'd they partner me with a rookie?
Wanna come?
Married?
Good night, Wade.
No.  Talk English.  Then I'll understand.
Two lousy smokes.  You're a real sport.
Wanna try?
Let's roll.  We got a guy who swears his car was stolen by a suspect identical to Doucet. 0800 this morning.
Kid, you ever been in a high speed chase before?
How do I look?
What's this?
So, he's got a thing for prison clothes.
You be careful.
Jesus, Sanchez... what do you think you're doin'?  That's flatfoot data. You're not supposed to have access to that.
He had a partner.  Our own Ray Gallagher.  He tagged Wade dangerously defiant. Psychotic.  Reckless.  Seems our Commissioner didn't like him much. Busted his buns on a narcotic's violation.  Wade was sentenced to twenty-five years.
You could always take it off.
Let's dance together -- Belle.
Jabez -- ?
Belle --
That's my business. -- Now, it's all right, Daniel.  What did he do?
Hello, Colonel! Want a lift?
I think I'd like to begin with the fire-eater --
Make them go faster, Mr.... ?
Anybody can see that.
But it didn't stop. I know it didn't stop. Granny told me it didn't.
Kin you spare a moment for me Jabez?
Yes, but what does a farmer do if he don't want to get roped in some more by them loan sharks?
Don't I? ... Say, that's mighty white of you, Jabez.
Loan shark -- hey?
Never mind. What's your name?
Where's everybody?
Now run along, Daniel.
All right -- so it's buried with you!
You've had a lot of bad luck these days. And yet -- it's all so unnecessary. When I think of your opportunities --
Of course. Why man, you have one of the richest farms in the county.  You just go about it the wrong way -- so many men do. Hard work -- well, that's all right for people who don't know how to do anything else. It's all right for people who aren't lucky -- but once you're lucky -- you don't work for other people. You make them work for you.
Why, Mr. Stone, you look so worried. Can I be of any service?
Trying to break our contract again, Mr. Stone?
What a headstrong fellow! Well -- I guess you're quite prepared to suffer the consequences.
Suddenly you seem quite desperate, Mr. Stone --  -- You know I'm a good-natured man. I'm always open to reason. With a little security -- I might--
I'm afraid that's hardly the sort of security I was thinking of --  You see -- there is that promising little fellow, your son ...
Well now, Mr. Stone, did you make up your mind?
Jabez Stone -- did you or did you not sign this document?
I don't seem to be so very popular after all -- in Cross Corners.
Well -- Mr. Webster! This is a great day for me. Come on in, sir. I want you to take the seat of honor and meet all my guests!
No -- you haven't time -- You haven't time for your mother, or your wife, or your child.
I see. And this is where he'd like to collect, too.
Ahem -- we want to have a little confidential talk with you, Neighbor Stone. Don't like to take a man away from his planting -- but sometimes --
Oh!
And so, Jabez Stone, in the name of the Whig Party of Cross Corners, we offer you the nomination of that party for Selectman.
How much?
He's stubborn as a Stone.
Your butter money?
Jabez!
Oh Jabez! And we were counting on ...  It's a lovely calf.
Mary -- what would you do with a pot o' gold?
Mary -- what would you do?
Well -- that's the last time -- we'll have servants to do it.
Mr. Webster ... Wait! ...  Mary!
Mary! Come back ...
"There was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God and eschewed evil."
You know that, son.
Well, son, I'm glad to see a Stone come up in the world again.
It won't be the first baby ever born in this house.  There! Made me drop a stitch!  Sit down, you make me nervous!  Lan's, that's the way a man always is. Thinks his son's the most important thing in the world.
Money -- money's a funny thing, ain't it, Ma?
Now that's the way to talk, Son! I know you worked hard for that crop. But we'll make out.
Golly, Ma --  Consarn that music! Shouldn't a-had the harvest festival tonight.
Wish I could really do something for you. But you know Stevens. He'll throw you off your farm tomorrow if you don't pay him tonight.
Mary! Ready? First bell's a-ringing!
So you've made up your mind to go to the party.
Well, Martin, I only wear them in Washington -- that's the trouble. But if you ever come down there, I'll show them to you.
Hey there, Dan'l! Black Dan'l!
Say, that's pretty good, young man.
Mr. Webster, I presume?
There, Mr. Webster.  All open and above-board and in due and legal form.
The quick or the dead! You have said it.  May -- the best man win, Mr. Webster!
That isn't it. It's ... the loneliness, Mr. Scratch ... the loneliness!
I want someone to talk to ...
I'm John McClane.
If your friend is hot to trot...I know a couple of mama bears.  ...Or is he married?
The girl was off today.  Hey, I didn't expect you to sit up front.  So, your lady live out here?
Meanwhile, you still live in New York?
She had a good job, it turned into a great career.
Like I said, Argyle...you're fast.
What are you going to do?
You're very perceptive.
You're amazing.  You figured this all out already?
The code key, please...?
Bad for your health anyway.
Hear that?  Talk to me, where are my detonators.  Where are they or shall I shoot another one?  Sooner or later...  ...I might get to someone you do care about.
You...you don't work for Nakatomi... and if you're not one of them...
That was tricky, with the accent. I bet you do a great Ed Sullivan. Why do you need the detonators, Hans? I already used the explosives.
Nein, dies ein ist mein.  This time John Wayne does not walk off into the sunset with Grace Kelly.
No more jokes, drop it or she gets it between the eyes!
How long?
You better heat up that miracle				* you were talking about.  We broke through on Number Six, and the Electromagentic came down like a sledgehammer...
...the circuits that cannot be cut... are cut automatically in reponse to a terrorist incident...You ask for miracles, Theo...I give you the FBI...
After all your posturing, all your speeches...you're nothing but a common thief.
They would, huh?
Didn't we have this same conversation in July?  Damn it, John, there was an opportunity out here -- I had to take it --
Excuse me, I'm looking for --
You wife's made for this business. She know how to drive a hard bargain.
No, but it's gonna need one hell of a paint job and a shitload of screen doors.  One spotters say you got two with that blast.
You sound like a man with a couple of kids.
They way you drive, I can see why.
Hey, you couldn't know.
Look...I'm getting a bad feeling up here...I'd like you to do something for me.  Look up my wife...don't ask how, you'll know by then...and tell her...tell her...I've been a jerk. When things panned out for her, I should've been behind her all the way ...We had something great going until I screwed it up...She was the best thing that ever happened to a bum like me.  She's heard me say I love you a thousand times, but she never got to hear this...honey...I'm sorry.  You get all that?
I am, Sir...Sergeant Al Powell.
The terrorists?  Don't know, Sir. We haven't heard a peep from them.
What about the body that fell out of the window -- ?
These seats come out?
Jesus, you're the man!
God damn it, Sheila isn't gonna believe it.  They just call in and say gas up a stretchout and get it down to  and I say, 'shit, another load of Elks for the massage parlors.'
Hey, Sonny!  I'm watchin' it on TV!
Jesus - what - I'm afraid - I'm gonna get shot or whatever.  You oughta see it on TV, the guns, the cops, they got cannon, machine guns, they're loaded with gear.
What guns?
How are you doing?
I'm getting out of here, man.  I'm not going to stay here and I'm not giving up.  I mean, huh, they're going to kill me, anyway.  So fuck it!  But, if I can get out of this... I am going to get out. And, how I'm going to do it is to get a jet out of here and I'm flying the fuck out... That's all, Leon.  If you want to come with me, then you're entitled... you can come.  You're free to do what you want.
So!  Sal is with you?
Sal... Sal... Naturale, oh boy!
Yeah... I knew it.  But, what choice do I have?  I'm in the hospital; they drag me out of the hospital... bring me down here...
Yeah... huh, thank you.  I'm going to go back, Sonny, to the hospital. They're really nice people.  They're really trying to help me.
Well... I don't know if I have or not.
It's my only chance!
Leon?  Whatsa matter?  They give you a shot down the hospital or what?
If he won't listen to you, who will he listen to?
He needed money?  For the operation for you?
Well, don't you figure you owe to him to get him out of there?
Okay, give us the women.
The girl hostages.
What the hell you doin' back there?
Is he all right?  Is he all right?
Hey... let him out!
Okay, is the vault open?
Hello, Mulvaney here...
To what ... learn how to shoot? They don't get a gun.
I'm okay ... I'm okay ...
Hey!  I'm tryin' to help you.
You like me?
You know ... I like you people ... I really do.
Yeah.
Mister Mulvaney?
You got Bank Americard?
What is it, Sam?
Ah, Sonny!  Good luck, you know?
When was the last time you saw Sal?
You don't smoke ... why do you want to start now.
You shouldn't start now.
Go ahead.  Do what you want to do. I hate to see you break a perfect record.  You oughta take care of your body.
You're really pure, you know?  You got a perfect record.  You never used that stuff to ruin your body, why start now?
Where's the money?
He wants one.
Okay, Sal ... what do we do?
Sonny -
Sal?
Just give me a receipt.  Hey, Sal, you okay?
There it is, Sal.  Sal?
Aw, Jesus ... you been doin' us favors all night!
I want to come in, and see if everybody's okay.
Nobody give their right name ... it's the FBI!
What's wrong?
I ain't eaten all day.  I just realized it.
Oh, shit!  I gotta have time to think.
My kids ... Kimmy and Jimmy.
Here's your document, Sonny.
Fuck!  We did it!
You did what?  Who did you talk to? What for?
Don't talk to them anymore.  Sal and me are getting a jet, we're going to Algeria - I'll write you from there.
For God's sake don't start in on Heidi again ...
Not now, Mom, please.
I can't, Mom.  If I come out Sal will kill them.
What the hell for?  Twenty-five years in the pen?
I'm a fuckup and an outcast.  There isn't one single person in my life I haven't hurt through my love. You understand that?  I'm the most dangerous person in the world, because if I love you, watch out, you're gonna get fucked, fucked over and fucked out!

The mold? I am living among these crypto-fascist Orange County cunts... with daddy's BMW and the boob job... just waiting to implode.
Cunt.
What the... <i>who is this bitch?</i> <b> EXT. HAWTHORNE COMMUNITY CENTER -- PARKING LOT -- NEXT </b> Ed and Choco exit the El Camino just as Domino retrieves her knife from the windshield. She grips it in her right hand... threatening them.
You can save that Pretty Woman shit. The name is Domino.
Really? Did you play in a band?
Cool it, Choco.
Something is going down. Something bad.
They need to get the introduction on camera. Just play along, alright?
We didn't sign on for this shit.  Fuck! This shit is intense. I need to call my agent.
Get Cynthia on the line. <i>They changed the fucking font.</i>
Just like Billy Ocean says. <i>When the going gets tough...</i>
Ya back is got.
Buggin' Out, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but you can really direct your energies in a more useful way.
Don't come back, either.
What da fuck!  Are you deaf?
You a dumb-ass simple motherfucker. Where did you read that?
How long?
Hold your tongue.  You don't have that much love.
Wake up?  Saturday is the lone day I get to sleep late.
Is this another one of your patented two-hour lunches?
I just don't want you to lose the one job you've been able to keep, that's all.  I'm carrying you as it is.
Hurry up and get dressed.
No.
Jade, I don't want you coming in here no mo'.
...peanuts.
This might take some time.
D, not C.
C'mon, don't be shy.  Mmm, smells good.  This is ya Love Daddy talkin' to ya, starvin' like Marvin. Say something, Mookie.
WAKE UP!
Fool, you're thirty cents away from a quarter.  How you gonna get a boat?
It's a fucking shame.
ML?
Mookie, get offa da phone.
Mookie!  How is anybody gonna call in?
Can you pay me now?
Mookie, I always liked you.  Not the smartest kid, but you're honest. Don't make me dislike you.
Mookie?
Doctor, always try to do the right thing.
Alright.  Alright.  I'll be over there sometime today.
Tina, you are too slick.
How long then?
What else?
Where are you going?
Be a man.
Mookie, late again.  How many times I gotta tell you?
Give dat bum a dollar for sweeping our sidewalk.  What do we pay Mookie for?  He don't even work.  I work harder than him and I'm your own son.
You deaf or what?
Who's your favorite basketball player?
I didn't know you could read.
Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  I just got here.  You sweep.  I betcha Sal asked you first anyhow.
I'll be back after I make this delivery.
Brother, Mookie, if I love you I love you, but if I hate you...
I love you, my brother.
See, Pop.  That's just what I was talkin' about.  Every single time you tell Pino to do something, he gives it to me.
Mookie's OK.
Stop busting my balls.  I said I'm listening ten fucking times already.
Pino, get a broom and sweep out front.
Turn it off.
You're gonna be in the street with the rest of your homeboys.
Pop, stop lying.
The both of youse, shaddup.
How ya doin', Mookie?
You're it.
Sleeeeew sheek baw...
Oh, yeah. I don't think they do. You're new here, right?
HARRY!
Wipe your feet. My parents are totally anal.
Just down the hall.
The name's Walter.
We've got some margarine too if you'd like to scoop it out of the tub.
Wow, a treasure map! What's the treasure?
You're going to be just fine, HARRY.
My mom says the treasure's somewhere in the school.
We're part of a special class taught by the lunch lady, er, I mean Ms. Heller. Maybe you'd like to join us, it doesn't require any walking.
Maybe we should ask Jessica to join the class.
Oh, yeah. Well I almost always beat Captain Rob.
I don't think so. This guy drinks rum from a barrel, says "yo ho ho" has a peg leg...
If he heard you talking like that he'd make you walk the plank.  Three, two, one. Now it's your turn, spin.
Where did you learn that word?
Collins is a great man!
HARRY.
Hey, teach, how'd you get so smart?
You're it.
These are really cold, huh?
Owww... refreshing.
I don't know. Owwww.
Owww.
LLOYD, where've you been? I've been waiting forever. I'm so embarrassed.
Oh. Sorry. You're right, field trip partner is a big commitment.
Who cares? Chicks are for fags.
It's really not up to you, Harry. But we just want you to feel like you're part of the decision.
I kinda screwed things up.
You have beautiful eyes.
HARRY! I found the treasure!
Hey, there's no reason to use that kind of language!
By the way, did Captain Rob mention how I beat the crap out of him this afternoon?
You're it.
Are, too.
That makes total sense. The treasure chest was in his office. Which means Principal Collins is a pirate! I'm surprised Captain Rob never mentioned him.
Guys, this is much better.
Oh my god. Can you believe your ears?
Oh my God! She's two-timing PRINCIPAL COLLINS!
You take her.
So can I come along?
Are you wearing a coconut bra?
Why are you teaching Special Needs? You're the lunch lady.
Poor question. Too wordy. A good question gets right to the point. Example, where's my chest?
TURK, what are you doing here?
Being a jerk doesn't make you special.
Well I was born in St. Louis.
What are you doing here?
Well, something stinks.
I'm so close I can feel it.
That's it. I'm done.
Don't worry about me, I'll be fine. I can take care of myself and I'm getting the story every high school reporter dreams of.
What? It's nothing, the cast comes off in six weeks.
How much homework is there?
Your assignment is to pick the class. Find some other students just as special as you.
Obviously.
What?
I think you did it.
... and, Principal Collins, you'll be pleased to know that this year Wednesdays are "South of the Border" days. We'll serve a spicy tuna tamale along with a cheese quesadilla.
You know honey, I've finally figured out a way of bilking enough money from the school to get us that condo in Waikiki.
Times two.
To take a picture for Superintendent Zimmer?
Guess what"s under these coconuts.
Oh, just like the President.
Where is it?
Are you going to kill her?
He wishes to inform you that Vendetta -- as he puts it, using the ancient tongue, the art of Kanly -- is still alive. He does not wish to meet or speak with you.
We have just folded space from Ix...
I can assure you...
No music. I'm packing this for the crossing. Shield practice.
What's gotten into Gurney? He's not faking. Paul presses forward and the fight moves quickly around the room. The smell of ozone grows stronger as the shields hit and SPARK off one another. Paul directs a parry downwards, turns, and leads Gurney against the table, plunging at just the right moment to pin Gurney against the table top with his blade right at Gurney's neck.
You've no need of your weapons with me Gurney Halleck.
No, but many consider my training valuable.
Paul, this is the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam. She is going to... observe you...  Please... -- REVEREND MOTHER Jessica, you know it must be done. I enjoin you to stand guard at the door and practice the meditation of peace.
Don't touch my mother...
He knows.
Run!
What's happened?...  Why did it leave?
Will we see a worm?
Liet?
The Water of Life.
My own name is a killing word.  Will it be a healing word as well?
Long live the fighters!
THE PAIN!
Yes. Perhaps he would at that.
I can't believe this!  <u>I</u> sleep in coffins!
Why were you buying a coffin?
Oh, there's my bus.  Shit, where's my transfer?!
Boy, Mr. Lugosi, you must lead such an exciting life.  When is your next picture coming out?
Eddie, what kind of movie is this?
Bela! It's so great to see you!  And eight o'clock on the dot.  Right on time!
But we need to start off with a bang! Something we <u>know</u> the audience will want to see.  Mmm.  What was your biggest hit?
Ha-ha!  Dr. Acula!
Let me take you to the hospital.
Goodbye!  Goodbye!
You'll be sitting on the right.
It was a very impressive offer. Fancy offices, a big home... I'd be treated like a king.
Eddie, I'm so tired... I don't know if I can handle a night shoot...
Bela.  I just wanna thank you again for last night.
Why aren't you on your honeymoon? Where's Myrna?
What are you doing?
I've got some good news.  The doctor says you're all better.  You can come home.
Eddie, I wanna make another picture. When are we gonna make another picture?
So Eddie, don't we need a sound crew?
Eddie, I want to thank you.  These last few days have been a good time.
You don't understand!  The octopus is supposed to live in a <u>lake</u>!
I don't understand.
Bravo!  Bravo!  Magnifico!
Edward, are you sure you know what you're doing?
No!  A horror movie star!
It's a shame.  He's such a rest actor, and nobody uses him anymore.
Ed, I'm so proud!  I'll read it as soon as I get home.
It's a damn good role.
It takes me comfortable.
Look on the bright side.  If we miss the rent, what's the worst they can do?
Ed, the landlord called again.  He wants his money.
Don't get angry at me.  Maybe you just need a day job.
Goddamn landlord.
Maybe if you'd come to the backers party, I would've gotten the money.
Eddie, which dress do you like better?
Sorry to bother you while we're shooting, but the guy who owns the stage needs his money.
I kinda need it now.
He's so great, <u>you</u> hire him.
Oh, "Dr. Acula."  I get it.  I don't like it.
Mr. Reynolds!
So, Mr. Johnson --
Tor.  Have you ever thought about becoming an actor?
Here's the scene.  Loretta, you're in a trance.  You glide in and get on the operating table.  Now Tor, you're supposed to tie her down.  But you have an angora fetish... and when you rub that swatch of angora, it makes you refuse so Bela has to discipline you.
Hey!  You're not eatink.
My eyes are killink me.
Mr. Welles, is it all worth it?
No, no, not at all!  I <u>love</u> women. Wearing their clothes makes me feel closer to them.
Mr. Weiss, I was thinkin' about what you said, about how all your movies have to make a profit.  And I realized, what's the one thing, that if you put in a movie, it'll be successful??
Yeah.  Crap with a star.
Why would Lugosi want to be in a sex-change flick?
Ed, what was the one thing I asked you to do?  Make it <u>seven reels long</u>. I've got contracts with my exhibitors.  If it ain't over an hour, they won't play it.
Georgie, what's with the stag footage??  You said you were cutting in <u>establishing shots</u>!
How long's he been here?
He's better.  Thank you for asking.  How's your friend?
Oh, flowers!  I didn't know you were so traditional.
So have you always lived in L.A.?
Oh.  I loved those shows!  "Inner Sanctum"... "The Shadow" --
Kathy, I'm about to tell you something I've never told any girl on a first date.  But I think it's important that you know.  I like to wear women's clothes.
Does this mean you don't like sex with girls?
Oh.  Okay.
You know, when you rewrite a script, it just gets better and better!
Those assholes.
I can't get it to go up.
Huh?!
No, don't worry, I moved on.  I was just calling to see if you want to attend the world premiere of my new film, "Bride Of The Monster."
Look... would it be possible to make the "Ghoul's Wife" a little less prominent, so people won't really notice me in the movie?
Wow, this lab looks great.  Except why is there a stove and refrigerator?
Hey.  This is looking good!  Paul, where's the octopus motor?
You know, to make the legs move --
Norma, this is Bela -- Bela, this is Norma.  Norma, this is Tor -- Tor, this is Norma.  Norma, this is Paul Paul, this is Norma.
This is our choir director.  He's gonna play the young hero.
My goodness, you're embarrassing me.
Eddie, I'm just a small-town girl. I've never done this before.
Well, I was wondering if maybe sometime you'd like to go out, and maybe grab some dinner.
No. Kissing and hugging, okay, but if it's actual sex they have to cut away.
Yeah. I brought you some movies.
What do you love her or something?
Whatever happened to Norman Rockwell?
How's your mother?
Our neighbors gave me a ride.
Oh, Al ... This is just...
So?
What did you study?
That has my work number, my home number, my pager number. I sleep three hours a night. Call me whenever you want to talk. Off the air, on the air, whenever. Okay?
Yeah?!
Ed --
I don't think so.

You said that.
Yeah.  Honey, if you're watching this is for you.
No! Like, ten years ago. In Texas. Baby...  Jessica!
No. It's a mess.
Hey, he cheated on her.
I know you. This Shari is a passing fancy.
I can't believe you're taking his side.
She had white shoes.
What's the difference?
Oh my God. You and Al were - and that's why you threw him out.
One thing led to another. He was my husband once.
I can't?
Um, yeah, I was gonna ...
Are you sure about this?
Cream rinse?
Really?
Oh God, this is so weird.
So? What do they think -- we're not kids --
Page three of the Post.
Twenty-nine.
I feel like a criminal or, like we're cheating on someone.
Okay.
I need to talk.
What do you want me to do? You want me to quit the show?!
Kinda'.
Let's have a contest. Now this would mostly be open to professional investigators and detectives. But anyone can join in.
I'm not stitching Nikes in Panama! ... Bedwetter!
I got your message. Way to go!
Look -- there's a million ways to humiliate yourself - I gotta think of a new way? I mean, it's all day! Every minute. Id be like a monkey at the zoo. I just...
You would do this? You would actually --
That's right. You don't know. Doors don't fly open for guys like us.
Who is it?
Hello... Shari, hi... Oh no! ... Oh God!
Look, we gotta talk.
You know what your problem is?
And each contestant gets one of these.  An "I tried to screw a network executive" tee-shirt.
Quite a shithole, isn't it?
That girl's an idiot.
Why don't you come over. And I'11 make dinner. And you bring a movie. And ... We'11 make a night of it ... okay?
Look, my life is not so great, that I want it shown on television. And neither is yours.
But you haven't written your novel.
One night he took us editors out to celebrate after a deadline. Eventually Dave and I were left alone and we got to talking - not like teacher and student, but like two adults.
Around that time Diane and I were hanging out a lot at Sherry Novotny's house, giving her our love and support and helping her make it through a difficult time.
Come on, doit. Doit. Fill me up. Come on, fill me up
What?  Right.  So let's start counting.
Fine.  So do your count.  Start with president, and I'll be right back.
You're kidding, right?
Mostly Tammy fans
It happens, Larry. People make mistakes.
Good morning, Mr. McAllister.
Here they are.
Looks good to me.
NO, that's fine
I can't wait to start campaigning.
You know, Mr. M., when I win the presidency, that means you and I are going to be spending a lot of time together next year.  And I for one would like that time to be harmonious and productive. Wouldn't you?
Okay. That's good. I just wanted to make sure.
Are you sure all her signatures are real?  It's not easy to get all those signatures.
These are a bunch of burn-outs. And look at this one, I can't even read this one.
Tim Kobza?  Tim Kobza!  Who's he? I've never heard of him!
So, are you looking for something sporty or more practical?
Why are you doing this?
I want you to do something for me.
Oh, is this...?  God. First one of these I haven't been in for a long time.
What a surprise.
Jim, where the hell have you been?
Life would go on, and I would certainly be a stronger and wiser person from the experience.
Hmm?
I don't believe you.
After Dave got fired, Sherry kicked him out of the house and filed for divorce.
I can't afford this stuff right now.
Shall we give it a name?
Don't say that.  You know it's not true.
I know.  I understand disappointment. I really do.
Fine.  Let's say all you ever knew was apples.  Apples, apples and more apples. You might think apples were pretty good, even if you occasionally got a rotten one. Then one day there's an orange. And now you can make a decision. Do you want an apple, or do you want an orange? That's democracy.
And on Halloween we could have a haunted house.  But a really good haunted house, not like those cheesy bad ones.  You know, more like the radio station ones.  This one would be really scary.  And for Homecoming -- well, you know how last year's theme was -
You said I was a liar   You're the liar, you're the --
Way to go, Tracy!  Isn't this exciting?
Yeah.  So guess what happened.  So Mr. McAllister, he --  Oh hi. Lisa.
What do you want?
Now could you leave me alone?
You got a brother up in Folsom.  I know because I put him there.
Merry Christmas.
Can I get you a drink?
Have you ever heard of Dick Stensland?
Yeah I know.  Patchett's running whores and judging by his address, probably something bigger on the side.  He doesn't want any attention.
Did Lefferts have a boyfriend?
Look.  I want to see you again.
In the morning.
Yeah, I hate them.
Will you work for me?
How what, Wendell?
Don't look so down in the mouth, Bud.  You nailed him good.
No.  I'll tell you sometime.  Not now.  Don't want to jinx it.  But it could take the edge off that jail time I got coming.
Mrs. Lefferts, I'm Officer White with the L.A.P.D.  I'd like to ask a couple of questions.
Susie, I told you I didn't approve of that boyfriend.  He was too old for you.  You let him come into this house and be fresh to me.  I went out one day and old Mrs. Jensen next door saw Susan's boyfriend and another man and thought she heard a ruckus.
We were never properly introduced. Susan and I were fighting that day.  She called him by a nickname.  Muns or Lunts or something.
One in six.  Where's the girl?
Pierce Patchett figures in, too. That's the angle Jack was working. Dudley must work for Patchett.
It's a suicide note.  Says he killed Jack because Jack had figured out a pornography scam Patchett was running.
We had one thing figured wrong.  I don't think Dudley workd for Patchett.
Richard Stensland.
Officer White.  How about Susan Lefferts?  You know her?
Where's the other guy?  Buzz.
Oh, yeah.  That was a long time ago.  Before your day.  The last few years he's been muscle for hire.  But I heard he's disappeared.
How 'bout I give you your balls back?
Bullshit.  Where would a two-bit ex-cop get 18 pounds of heroin?
Cotton balls.  I found them just inside the meat locker door.
Exactly.  At least one of those animals had the brains to protect his ears.
Jack Vincennes.  He's the technical advisor on 'Badge of Honor,' sir.  He lives for it. That's the way to get him.
Where are the police academy files?
You're twenty-two, aren't you, Ray?
Just getting my facts straight. Twenty-two makes it a gas chamber bounce. You should have pulled this caper a couple of years ago.  Get life, do a little Youth Authority jolt, transfer to Folsom a big man. Orbit on some of that good prison brew, get yourself a sissy --
That fucking Larry.  I almost believed him.
Why were you throwing clothes in the building incinerator?
What do you mean Deuce Perkins got clipped last night?!
That was his favorite toast.  I saw the test results on the lieutenant's exam.  You placed first out of twenty-three.
No.
Stensland's a disgrace.  Straight D fitness reports from every C.O. he ever served under.  But White is a valuable officer.
Sir, I took the call.  It's my case.
There are loose ends out there, Dudley.  I --
Jack was a shame, but Dick Stensland had the audacity to try to sell me my own heroin.  Through his whore girl friend.  I sent him to make the buy.  The rest is history.
John Vincennes.  It's three A.M., lad.
You remember Buzz Meeks, Dudley?
Twelve years ago he worked a vice roust with Dick Stensland.  They arrested a Pierce Patchett on an extortion scam.  Guy ran hookers. He'd have them photographed with their johns, then double-dip for some blackmail.  Charges got dropped.  Insufficient evidence. You were supervising officer on the case and I was wondering if you remember anything about it.
You're the key witness?
Yeah, Exley.  What's the payoff?
L.A.P.D.
Decorated?
I get the idea.  You got a description?
I'll tell you what I told Officer White when he asked me about Susan's death.
For the last time.  I may suborn women into illicit activities, but they're handsomely compensated, I treat them well and make sure the men they deal with show them every due respect.
How was I?
I want to know why you see him. Is it a Patchett payoff?
I came out here with a dream. That's gone, but I settled for reality.
Like recognizes like.  I'm pretty tough, myself.
If I knew you were coming I'd have baked a cake.
It seems like my Susan, but...
Let my Susie rest in peace!
My daughter was a virgin!
Jack!  It's Christmas!
You tight with the D.A., trash?
He's dead.  I was just there. Somebody slit his throat.
Yeah.  Sergeant Jack Vincennes requesting.  I need the home address on a Pierce Patchett.
Was it a party?
Working whores with squad two.
I don't know anything about Zavitz.
And you were the last one to talk to him.
What'd he give to you?
Don't bullshit me, I can save your life.
Um...who's that?
Tired of chasing squirrels around the park?
Lemme ask you something. I put a bird feeder out in the yard, but the squirrels, they keep taking--
They keep taking the bird seed. I thought since you're the expert on--
I'm doing a transfer now.
Why don't you just call Brill directly.
Considering the enormous exposure to which you've subjected this firm, I'd think you'd do best to simply answer my questions.
I don't know what that means.
I don't know what that means.
Wait. What do I do?
What if--
I was worried about my hundred and twenty 'K'.
I didn't use my name.
None of your business.
I intercepted phone calls.
Them.
Empty 'em 'till they're almost flat. And turn your head. There might be some debris flying your way.
I was thinkin' about asking for my hundred and fifty grand and calling it quits.
What if <u>what</u>?
Reynolds.
What do you know about locking cellular phone signals?
What are you dialing?
Is it okay?
You'd like to buy your wife some lingerie as a Christmas gift.
How 'bout Christian Dior?
It's a little late for that.
I'll be right back.
I think she'll like this very much.
I know, but--
Well, I need to find out as much about Daniel as possible.
Because my life is being ruined.
Yes?
I'm sorry. Detective Morelos.
No, sir, I'm not involved with that. I'm doing a quick follow-up on a bus accident took place a few nights ago. Your name keeps coming up.
About the accident.
Are you invoking attorney/client privilege.
I don't know what's goin' on with Zavitz, but that was way, <u>way</u> outa line.  You understand?
Hey.
Bobby!
I don't understand why Jerry couldn't clear this up.
Stacy?
I told you I didn't want you seeing her.
Oh, please--
I know.
It wasn't me.
Stacy, somebody's trying to kill me. Now goddamit--
Has anyone been by? Police? FBI?
I don't think anybody wants the drapes, Stacy, I think the drapes are okay.
The lingerie.
...who root through...uh...presents, and...
Are you sure you're safe?
My suitcase--
I'm sure we can locate it for you, sir.
You don't know who the fuck--
No, I meant I'm Presbyterian.
Brill?
Ten thousand cash. I don't know if it's Brill's prices going up or your commission.
I got a call from my firm this morning saying don't come in.
Good. You're just what I need right now.
I gotta go.
You being audited?
That's temporary.
Fuck you. When you needed information, I got it. You didn't care how.
I don't <u>have</u> a life, Bobby. I'm in love with a married man.
Who <u>are</u> you people?
He didn't.
He didn't <u>give</u> me--
I'm sorry, Mr. Dean. But Larry's in St. Lukes now, so I'm a little--I'm not myself. The Union bosses say unless we take Bellmoth's offer, it'll only get worse.
Because they've been paid off by Bellmoth.
She can't talk to you right now.
In your dreams.
Where've you been?
Are you and mom getting a divorce?
Can I talk to you a second?
That's what I want to talk to you about?
The Congressman's very happy to have your support, but he's heard that there's an investigation.
Jerry--
You gotta--
I won't <u>make</u> it to the police. They won't let me get there. You go.
I'm sorry, man.
Tell me about it.
Are you okay?
What is it you want?
What?
No, no, I'm sorry. I didn't realize you were hoping to be transferred to a weathership outside Greenland.
No sir.
And they have the video. That's confirmed.
How'd you get in the building?
We're not stupid, Reynolds.
Do I look like I want a tiny pizza?
Isn't Zerzura supposed to be protected by spirits who take on the shape of sandstorms?
I can't sing.  but I can tell a story.  I might need a prompt.  Do you have your Herodotus?  I've noticed you carry it?
That insults them.
This is an incredible story - about a man hunting an Ostrich, he's been telling me about Zerzura, he thinks he's been there, but his map, the route he's describing, he couldn't survive the journey now, but he's a poet, so his map is poetry - and now we're onto an Ostrich.  I'm telling her your map is poetry. The Arab shrugs.
What is he saying?  Come on, what did he say?
You should come into the shelter.
Don't.
A woman should never learn to sew, and if she can she should never admit to it.  Close your eyes.
When were you least happy?
Okay.  And what do you love? Say everything.
Say you're sick.
I can still taste you.
Arabic?
I don't care to bargain.  It's full of saffron, just in case you think I'm giving it to you to encourage your sewing.
Is he next?  Do you drag him into your little room?  Where is it?  Is this it?
Very well.
Have you seen Katharine?
Right.  And what's your name, sir?
I understand you are agitated - perhaps you would like to sit down while I radio back to HQ -
We didn't care about countries. Did we?  Brits, Arabs, Hungarians, Germans.  None of that mattered, did it?  It was something finer than that.
I have to teach myself not to read too much into everything.  Comes of too long having to read so much into hardly anything at all.
May God make safety your companion.
I'm okay.  Look, it's a big house. We needn't disturb each other.  I can shoot a pistol!  I'll sleep in the stables.  I don't care where I sleep.  I don't sleep.
Buon' giorno.
Me?  You've got the wrong end of the stick, old boy.  So - Caravaggio - Hana thinks you invented your name.
First wedding anniversary - what do you call it?
What did you say?
But you were among the British, they were your friends - why betray them?
Marvelous plane.  Did you look?
I think you know all of us, except for Geoffrey and Katharine Clifton, who've recently come out from England.
Of course.  Well, we should all go out onto the terrace.
And a special thank you to Geoffrey and Katharine, without whose fund raising heroics we should still be kicking our heels. They toast the Cliftons.
There was a Prince, who was dying, and he was carried up the tower at Pisa so he could die with a view of the Tuscan Hills. Am I that Prince? Hana laughs.
Before you find too many uses for these books would you read some to me?
I will hide you in the room where we sleep, said Candaules. She stumbles over the word.
Candaules?you're laughing at me.
Could I have a cigarette?
He needn't disturb you.
This is Captain McGann.
Could I ask you to move?  I'm sorry - but when you turn, the sheets, I can't really bear the sheets moving over me. Sorry.
Tell me about this, this is in your handwriting - December 22nd - Betrayals in war are childlike compared with our betrayals during peace.  New lovers are nervous and tender, but smash everything - for the heart is an organ of fire?  I love that, I believe that.  Who is K?
I liked it better when there were just the two of us.
You like him, don't you?  Your voice changes.
Why don't you go?  You should sleep.
I'm not sewing anything else for you!
Try this.  I found a great jar of it. Olive oil.  In Naples this was so precious it would have bought you a wife.
For my hair?
Why would anyone do this?
Okay.  Get away from here.  Quick.
You must get away.  Before I cut. I'm not cutting if you're here. He's struggling.  He's going to topple over if he cuts.
I was thinking yesterday - yesterday! - the Patient, Hardy: they're everything that's good about England. I couldn't even say what that was. We didn't exchange two personal words, and we've been together through some terrible things, some -  he was engaged to a girl in the village! - I mean -  and us - he never once? He didn't ask me if I could spin the ball at cricket or the kamasutra or - I don't even know what I'm talking about.
What are you up to?
The war's over - you told me yourself. How can it be desertion?
It's not safe here.  The whole country's crawling with Bandits and Germans and God knows what.  It's madness.  I can't allow it. You're not, this is natural - it's shock. For all of us.  Hana -
Since Caravaggio turned up - food seems to appear, so please.
I was looking for the Lieutenant Singh.
A bomb.  At the Viaduct. She closes the door, then reappears.
Pardon me?
Brick platform opposite the old Ajaib-Gher -
It's still there, the cannon, outside the museum. It was made of metal cups and bowls taken from every household in the city as tax, then melted down. Then later they fired the cannon at my people - comma - The natives.
What are you talking about?
They're excited!  They're happy about destroying a whole city. Would they do that to a White Man's City?  Never!
Mac's signature.
That's doable.
Why are we speaking Chinese?
I don't want to waste your time.
Believe me, if you weren't so tiresome, I'd have one for you.
You have a car?
Seems I am.
Besides, if I lacked certain ethical scruples about the ownership of property--which I do not--I wouldn't need a partner, much less a callow girl. I'd do it myself.
I'm telling you it's a forgery. The paint's still wet for God's sake.
A film case.
We're going to die, aren't we...
Nothing? You don't even lock the door?
And good morning.
Years ago, if memory serves. When does the exhibit end?
We? Are you implying that I'm taking you inside?
A partner with secrets isn't much of a partner.
All this, this is a woman's version of what you would like.
That's it. We're ready.
We're working.
Careful...careful.
We did it.
Your share.
We're living history here.
Come on, what can you do with six billion you can't do with four?
I'll need the Rembrandt now.
Oh my god, I thought--
What about the rules?
The eight billion. From them to us.
What's that?
Peoples China Bank.
Got it.
You can't be serious.
Two men in the world don't need passwords or codes. Their retinas will scan to unlock everything. one of those two men is the chairman of the bank.
So what are you going to do with your share?
I'm going to disappear. I die in a car crash in Taiwan. Very easy to do.
Jesus God, it's going through.
Take the airport subway, but change at Jordan Station for Kowloon Tong.
He looks familiar.
I'm not real big on collecting banged up Ferraris at airports.
I'd give you a hand but it wouldn't look good.
We might not want to cash in our chips just yet. She has another job after this one. A big one.
Let me ask you, this Mask, when they made it--was the old bitch dead or alive?
Oh, it is.
Tonight your league night?
I really don't think that's a topic on which you have much to offer.
... what we do in here is keep track of all the case files.  That way, at any time, we can find out a case's status -- where it is in the office, stuff like that.  We file 'em all here, alphabetically --
Anna?  With this real-estate valuing stuff - - could you remind me, cause I'm a little confused about how exactly we do that.
What about in terms of medical expenses? 250,000 doesn't come close to what this family's gonna have to spend on doctors.
A million things could have caused those problems.  Poor diet, bad genes, irresponsible lifestyle.  Our offer is final and more than fair.
Tony Marvin.
His dry cleaners.  You want him?
Whoa.  Remind me.
What the hell is this doing here?
He came tearing around the corner, out of control --
Jesus.
So the whole idea of selling the house -- don't get me wrong, I'd be glad to move to some better place, but if they aren't gonna pay us properly, I just don't see the point.
Well -- then it's gotta be a different than what's in our water, cause ours is okay. The guys from PG&E told me.  They sat right in the kitchen and said it was fine.
It's a good day.  I feel good.
Oh, my God.
I can put them in a good school.
Okay, look.  If you really want to apply for a job here, you can do it the way everyone else does.  Send in a r?sum?, make an --
All I have is hundreds.
How come you're not at lunch with the girls? You're a girl.
What are you doing here?
Oh, yeah?
But, PG&E told her about the chromium?
So what made you think it was?
I didn't see any medical records in there.
I don't get why they'd do that.
I'm the one who's injured, and this joker who sits at a desk all day is gonna walk away with almost half my reward?
And this shit is bad news, Mr. Masry.  Not only does it attack every organ of the body, it fucks with your DNA, too.  That means these people's genes, and the genes of their kids, and the genes of their grandkids --
This is a whole different ball game, Erin. A much bigger deal.
For your information, Frank cares what was in those ponds 'cause he used to spend half his day wading around them.  That was his job.
I like this case.
Jesus.  They look like the Secret Service.
Someone's following me.
What kind of truck?
Is that what you want?
Why good?
Bullshit.  You'd drag me off my deathbed if it suited you.
Look, this is serious now.  They're talking serious money --
And if you had to guess ...
Wait, what do you mean, ten years?
Fuck legal terms.  We're talking about human beings here.  Sick people.  A whole bunch of them are gonna be dead in ten years.  They need their money now!  We gotta get 'em to agree to the arbitration, Ed.  We gotta get every damn one of those plaintiffs to --
When?  Where?
Why not?
Morning!
I was wrong.
I wasn't gonna --
Well, it's pretty boring work, shredding -- you gotta find some way to entertain your mind.  So yeah, I took a look.
And you were told to destroy those?
How come you didn't say anything when you found these things?
Well, how do I find out what kind of chromium is up in Hinkley?
Masry & Vititoe, can I help you?
I never forget, honey.  I try, real hard. It's just, for some reason, I don't seem to be able to organize things right and -- when it comes to you guys, I end up falling short.
Whose number do you need?
Ooh, now, see, if I'da known there was a beautiful woman next door, I'da done this different.  Let's start over.  My name's George.  What's yours?
Which number do you want, George?
Cause I don't even know you.
Great.  Another deadbeat.
What're you doing?
What are you doing here?
Well, hell, I guess that's it, then, huh? They're scarred for life.  They're gonna start holding up 7-11's any day now.
Look, don't take this the wrong way, but don't you think you might be out of your league here?
I'm just saying -- we have one night to ourselves, why do we have to spend it here?
What's going on?  What are you doing?
Thank you.
I don't do favors for you anymore.
They up?
How long's this whole thing gonna take?
You shouldn't be driving around, you know. You're sick.
I'm embarrassed.
I mean, it's not a problem or anything, but -- I'm just a little unclear on what those things are.  I thought maybe you'd know.
-- toothbrush, toothpaste, and a pair of hose.  Here.
Now how'm I supposed to do that when I'm not in here most mornings and nights?
When Donna told us about you, and what you told her about the chromium, we figured that might have something to do with this, too.
I know.  It's an awful lot.
You know that thing it says in here about rashes?
It'll be fine, yeah.
You're moving away?  When?
Oh.  Oh.
Well, look, there isn't a ton of information here, but from what there is, I'd say that these two people here -- what are their names?  Shanna and Ashley?
Our pursuit ships have sighted the Millennium Falcon, My Lord.  It has entered an asteroid field.
Will he finish what he begins?
Luke, use The Force only for knowledge and for defense, not as a weapon.  Don't give in to hate or anger or fear ... they lead the way to the dark side ... Luke nods and climbs back into his ship.
... Luke, you must not go.
Will you?  You underestimate The Emperor.  It is you he wants ... that is why your friends suffer.
How you doing, Chewbacca?  Still wasting your time with this clown, eh?
Turns on Lando, the newcomer, with an ominous growl.
Well, it's been awhile.
Howls and shrugs his shoulders.
Barks a doleful farewell.
We should have stayed and finished them off.
Okay, Chewie, it's now or never.
I'm looking for a great warrior.
Will it take long to get there? How far away is he?
Commander Skywalker hasn't come through the south entrance, sir. Maybe he slipped by without checking in.
Our destruction?  Who?
That's right.
I don't know, Artoo.  Sir, might I inquire what's going on?
Sir, I was wondering ...
I think we're in trouble.
It sounds like it's trying to get in.
That bounty hunter we ran into on Ord Mantell changed my mind.
You want me to stay because of the way you feel about me.
Am I?  I say you came running after me because you were afraid I was leaving you without even a kiss.
Spare me please!  Don't tell me about the Rebellion again.  I've had it with your noble mission. All you let yourself think about is the Rebellion.  The result is you're as cold as this planet.
Well, your worship, it looks like you arranged to keep me close by for a while longer.
Would it help if I got out and pushed?
Asteroids!  Chewie, bank left, let's find out where they're coming from ...
We've got to get out of this shower.
You don't look angry.
Sorry, Captain, being held by you isn't enough to get me excited.
I don't expect anything, except to be left alone.
That was no earthquake.
What are you afraid of?
I do not!
I see it Chewie, hang on.
Couldn't be, I checked the transfer circuits, just like you said!  I tell you this time it's not my fault.  I'm sure I checked it.
Well, sometimes ... Ah-hah, I knew it!  Lando Calrissian.
I don't like this.
Has Threepio turned up yet?
No thanks.
Hi kid, you look strong enough to wrestle a Gundark.
Are you kidding?
That won't be easy, my friend ... What brings you here, anyway?
It's a lovely outpost.
Very noble.  Not smart, but noble.
No argument, just do it.  That's a command!
I'm sure my men fixed it.  We've got nothing to worry about.
Nothing more can be done tonight. The shield doors must be closed. I can't wait any longer.  I'm sorry.
Have they analyzed the one that was killed?
Calm down, will ya?  Tell me about Han.
Master, moving rocks is one thing, but this is a little different.
No, no.  This will not do.  Anger is what you feel.
But tell me why ...
My mind fills with so many images.
There is no escape.  You must join me or die.  Don't make me destroy you here ... The Emperor is strong with The Force.  But if you join me, together we could overthrow Him.  Do not resist. It is our destiny!
Did you call the Zoo?
Nobody's going to believe it.
Go easy, Stevie.
L.A. is in a constant state of warfare. Gangs fighting for the right to rule.
You were injected with glucose. There is no Plutoxin 7 virus. You were never going to die - at least not from anything we gave you.
Give it.
Oh Cuervo...
I wouldn't be doin' that, Snake.
No, that sucks.  How are we getting out?
That's right, big shot. Unless you do what we want you're not coming back.
That's the deal.
Maybe. But you're not putting any shit in me this time.
Defense against what?
Location.
Too many people know where you're going, Snake. That's not good. Delgado and his men were back there waiting for you.
Listen up. I need directions. Downtown. Somebody named Hershe.
I got an idea, Snake.  This looks like the prototype, right?
What're you doing in here?
In the name of God, of St. Michael, and St. George, I make you a knight. Rise, Sir...
Good day to you, sir.
Thanks to God, you are alive.
You are still the best knight in Christiandom. You gained a hundred advantages over me. It is I who must love you, for through your courage and patience you taught me a bitter lesson.
These men repented before God for their evil deeds. Those who would not, met their fate at the end of my sword.  Accept the fruit of my first quest as my wedding gift.
They miss the battlefield. I think we do too.
Arthur.
At last...
Yes. He spoke to me. He said I would fight bravely tomorrow. I have never dreamed of Merlin before.
Then as knight to knight I can offer you mercy.
Excalibur! Is it true?
Where hides evil, then, in my kingdom?
Me? I have lived by the oath of king and knight.
What is this place, Merlin?
Father...
I will muster a great force of knights, and I will return to fight for what is mine.
He is the mightiest and fairest of knights.
I didn't know Leondegrance had a daughter.
And you cannot love me...
I have waited long for you. Once you almost saw, but fear blinded you. Why am I served from the chalice?
And there is no maiden in the whole world who inspires you?
Who?!
The law forbids it.
Why didn't he kill us?
I have walked my way since the beginning of time. Sometimes I give, sometimes I take. It is mine to know which, and when.
Merlin! Out of the sick sleep at last.
Maybe not even that, Uther. I thought once that you were the one to unite the land under one sword. But it'll take another, a greater king...
It must be alright. He's still running around digging up tombs. Besides, he's had experience.
You'd want to do the exorcism yourself?
It might be best to have a man with experience. Maybe someone who's spent time in the foreign missions.
Let's see whose around. In the meantime I'll call you as soon as I know.
I'm sorry.
It's a stylized ritual in which rabbis or priests try to drive out the so-called invading spirit. It's pretty much discarded these days, except by the Catholics who keep it in the closet as a sort of embarrassment. It has worked, in fact, although not for the reason they think, of course. It was purely the force of suggestion. The victim's belief in possession helped cause it; and just in the same way this belief in the power of exorcism can make it disappear.
Hi
And you got an invitation.
Phonograph.
Incidentally, just a chance in a million, I know; but your daughter - you could possibly ask her if she saw Mr. Dennings in her room that night?
Thank you.
Rats?
Yeah or maybe rats now will you just get those traps.
Very sorry, but you see, no rats!
Karl? Did you put this in Regan's bedroom?
Excuse me Miss?
Excuse me Madame? Will there be anything else?
A disorder of the nerves. At least we think it is. We don't know yet exactly how it works, but it's often seen in earl adolescence. She shows all the symptoms: the hyperactivity; the temper; her performance in math.
Well, you mentioned her father... the divorce.
Well, you see, that's quite similar to things like her lying- uncharacter-
Are you sure?
Are you planning to be home soon? LA, I mean.
Chris MacNeil?
Oh, I'm very sorry Father. Hi.
You're a friend of Father Dyer, right?
If a person was possessed by a demon of some kind, how do you go about getting an exorcism?
Oh yeah, since when?
Yes I could, I could see her as a psychiatrist...
Like her speaking in a language that she's never known or studied.
I don't know. I'll have to look it up.
There are no experts. You probably know as much about possession than most priests. Look your daughter doesn't say she's a demon, she says she's the devil himself and if you've seen as many psychotics as I have, you'd know it's like saying you're Napoleon Bonaparte. You ask me what I think is best for your daughter. Six months, under observation in the best hospital you can find.
Have you told him what's happening?
She...killed Burke Dennings.
Think it was a guilding. It was grey. Oh it was so beautiful, the guy let me ride it all around.
Wait a minute you need two.
You really don't want me to play huh?
Oh, Captain Howdy....
Oh I bet he is.
Mr. Dennings?
Well your thinking's not so good.
People get tired.
I don't want it.
Mother please! Oh please mother make it stop! It's burning, it's burning please mother!
What goes down there? I mean who's the priest I keep seeing, he's there all the time. He has black hair and he's very intense looking?
Where'd you get the money for the Chivas Regal? The poor box?
Heathcliff, Jackie Gleason, and in the role of Catherine Earnshaw, Lucille Ball.
Another one. Had your lunch?
If you're the devil, why not make the straps disappear?
Do it again.
How long are you planning to stay in Regan?
You are not happy. Tell me what is the matter?
No.
Be unto her o' Lord a fortified tower.
And also with you.
See the cross of the Lord. Be gone you hostile power. O'Lord hear my prayer.
Can you give her something?
Yeah, it's true. You do look like a boxer. John Garfield, in Body and Soul. Exactly John Garfield anyone told you that Father?
You've seen him. You're also familiar with how last week he died?
Really?
I know. I read it. These desecration's in the church?you think they have anything to do with witchcraft?
Ah, doctor's ethics. If you knew you wouldn't tell, huh?
Yeah, I hate to go alone. You know, I like to talk film; discuss the critique. D'you wanna see a film with me? I got passes to The Crest. It's Othello.
One last time: Can you think of some priest who fits the bill?
Who?
I cast you out!!! Unclean spirit...!
Is it Captain Howdy?
I'm afraid.
Frankie.
Yeah, come on in.
What about tomorrow?
Oh. No. Strictly dryland.
Just the same.
Nothing's the matter. Is it, sweetheart?
Start him out on cottage cheese. If you've got him on kibble, just soak it a few minutes.  Go down like pudding through a hot pipe.
Piano.
Oh my God ...
Great.  Terrific.  Glad you could make it.
That's a lot of water under the bridge, eh, Jack?
Count it.
Really.  You sleeping?
We gotta go, Jack.
What're you talking about?
Yeah ... we're gonna paint in the spring. After the rains.  Look good as new.
Bullshit.  Fifteen years, Frank. No one paid us off.
Thirty-seven.  Thirty-seven.
How many other silent partners are there, Frank? Donna?  Little Cindy? Hell, let's give Eddie a vote.
Get out of here!
You hit me.
Oh, brother.
Something, huh?  All those bids.
Okay I'll see you tomorrow night then.
Have some more wine, Frank.
I'm putting my stuff on the right, okay?
All night?
Accommodate?  I don't think I know what you mean.
What matters to me is we've got the six easiest nights we've had in ten years. So 'Tie a Yellow Ribbon' sounds a little flat. So what?  Nobody's gonna hear it, Jack.  Nobody. So why should you care?
How's it coming?
What're you trying to do?  Wake up the whole goddamn hotel?
We had a leak in the bathroom. He fixed it.
Expensive hangover.
God, the old man would've loved this view, wouldn't he?
That takes care of this week.  The tenth we got the Sheraton, the sixteenth we're at the Capri.
Be reasonable, Jack.
Cancel, Frank.
What's it for?
Seventy-one?  What's seventy-one?
Basketballs, Frank.  You had us playing for basketballs.
How're your hands?
You know, that night, I ... It just all came up.
Yeah.  Larry Shelton.  Blackie.  Couple others. Donna said even Lloyd called the other day. Nothing like a little absence to make the heart grow fonder, huh?
Jesus, when was the last time we played the Mallory?
I guess you're,right.  Well, what do you say we get a little midnight snack? Theo's should still be open.
Sick?  How sick?
Actually, that's my stage name.
Oh, sorry.  I get so caught up in it sometimes.  It's scary.
How should I take it?
I sing now?
So?
I mean, you're supposed to be backing me up, right?
Come on.
Come on.  We don't have much time.
I wear a seven.
Save it for your wife.
Well, they're aspiring to be sevens.
Fucking.  She says fucking in front of an entire room of people.
Fucking.
I guess it's,the Plaza then. That brings us to the twenty-seventh. We got the Avedon for three or the Park downtown for two.
Of course it smells like fish. We're on the ocean. What'd you expect, Chanel number five?
Wow. You ever see her again?
Uh, well, I love you, too, Jack.  So. Susie.  How 'bout it.
I'm gonna throw up, Frank.  I mean it. Let's drop it for the ten o'clock, okay?
Is that important?
Yes, sir.  That's quite a girl you boys latched onto.  She a local?
Lucky for you.  Well, there you go, guys. Don't spend it all in one place. Oh ... you want to count it, Jack?
Thanks.
Don't worry about it.
They never do, Mr. Barker.
Save it.  What's he look like?
Well, now, where's everyone run off to? Frank?
No.
Hey, he's not sore, is he?
Fucking.
He takes after our mother.
Nice place.  Fulla velvet.  Even the bedspreads.  Damn!  Two-fifty a pack and I go through 'em like toothpicks. Twelve-and-a-half cents a piece, you believe that?
You kidding?  We must've killed three pots in there.  Anyway, I gotta get home.  Rest the pipes.
Can't sleep?
How's egghead?
How do you do it? Every night?
My father proposed to my mother in there.
The both of them?  In there?
Oh. So what's it doing here?
They'd been out dancing all night and he took her to the train station -- she lived over in Brookhaven.  Usually held ride with her, but this time he didn't.  Anyway, he starts walking home, only as he's walking he starts getting nervous.
Oh. Hi.  Sorry.
Yeah.
Tell egghead I said hi.  If you see him.
Sneak out in the morning.  Before the guy could wake up and ruin it.  Never figured I'd be on the other end of it, though.
No shit. It's the goddamn water. Kill an ox. I buy bottled for my Danny. You can't trust the taps.
Maybe he'll ask your ma to marry him.
Older than me.
Well, let's get your first prom under the belt, okay?
How'd the show go?
There were more flowers last year.  Mr. Rinaldi down at the drugstore says it's going to snow by New Year's.  Says he can feel it in his elbows. I hope it snows.  I want to make a snowman. You ever make a snowman, Jack?
Waxy Wright.  Didn't Jon Archer bust you for poisoning five members of the Canadian parliament?
Fine work, Jon.
I'm complimenting you. Can't you ever just say "thanks"?
So?
What do you mean?
Do you know what it is to be in a coma?  It fucks up everything -- including your memory! I can't even tell you why Dobbs jumped me yesterday!
Uh -- to kill the doctors?
For being one helluva guy.
Totally -- you were being very, very bad.  You went up in the plane and jumped out.  You had a parachute, but it didn't open.
No.
Is someone there?
You can't go.  You can't be anywhere near that place.
I started wondering -- if you couldn't switch back -- would it make a difference?
How is the "date night" idea going over with Eve?
Jon, I'm getting a little annoyed by your obsessive need to spoil my fun.
What're you gonna do with me gone?  You'll drive your wife and kid nuts! I bet your daughter is just about ripe by now. What's her name, Janie?
What -- what are you doing?
You better be nice, Castor. You could get mighty lonely now that Pollux is gone.
SFPD?  Castor isn't stupid enough to come back to the city.
We've got him sighted. Okay, Pollux, pull out.
Screw your boundaries, Janie.  You have something I want.
Kim?
You always call me Miss Brewster.
You've got someone in your office.
What happened?
Don't worry, nobody knows I'm inside.  Check it out.  Remember that fat fuck agent who roughed us up in Thailand?  He's being treated for bone cancer at the V.A.  Thanks to the miracle of NSA grid-technology ...  -- Ooops!  His radiation does just quadrupled.
We gut the organization -- and rebuild it with more reliable friends.
Just following your example.
You'd have to start immediately.
Jon -- I don't have time to play games.  There're leftovers in the fridge.
Why do I feel like I'm on a blind date?
I think -- you're trying to get me drunk.
Isn't that what all this is about?  Letting Jamie go out, cooking me dinner, -- your next assignment?
-- what?
... That's great.
Nothing.
I'm going to the powder room.
Her assistant?
She didn't want me to go to London.  We're standing at the airport saying goodbye and she asks me to stay.
God, no.  I thought about it for practically the entire flight...
I was a sales associate, at E.F. Hutton.
Look, I know our paltry little two million in sales is about what you spend on office supplies in a year.  And I know some regional trucking company account is nothing compared to a sixty billion dollar merger...
Jack, are you okay?
Mom, don't you think we need to open the presents?
We're almost done here...
You know how to make chocolate milk?
Where do I go now?
One year he had a solar system named after her...
I'm having kind of a bad day.
You see, it's like we're in each other's heads...
Oh yeah...  What is it about you?
Hey, you can't park that thing here.
How'd you know my name?
Of course. Jack Campbell. I went to high school with you...you played baseball, right?  You're doing well...
Look, can I just borrow your car?!  I promise it'll be returned!
Like I said, it's a business deal...
Oh man, you're serious...  This man thinks I need to be saved!
Look, I'm not saying you'd be able to do it without some hard work...
Miss me, Jack?
No?  C'mon, Jack...I've got everything I need, I don't have regrets, that's just not for me... sound familiar?
Figure it out.  You got plenty of time.
As long as it takes to figure it out.  Which, in your case, could be considerable.
Because you got to figure it out for yourself.  Are you listening to me?
Are we...?
I don't care who you are.  It's Christmas and like I told you the building is closed.
Do I have a private office somewhere in the building?
...I was the number one junior sales associate at E.F. Hutton in 1988.  Did you know that?
Kate's on two, Jack.  Nice ride...
Don't  go, Jack...
Go. I'm sorry, you should just go...
Are you okay?
The city?  New York City?  Why?
Uh...that baby's crying...
Jack.  I said the kids are asleep...
Wait a second.  You want me, don't you?
How can you do that?
I mean...wow...off the charts great.
No?
Excuse me?
Look, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry I was such a saint before and I'm such a prick now.  Maybe I'm just not the same guy I was when we got married...
Well...Annie for one.
I think it worked out okay, don't you?
C'mon.
Not it...?
Here's the thing.  I really hadn't planned on giving you your...uh... anniversary gift until tonight.  You know, anniversary's good all day...
You are so not off the hook yet, slick.
I used to be so sure about everything, you know?  I knew exactly who I was and what I wanted. Then one morning I woke up and suddenly it was all different...
I mean yes, I help people that need it...
I don't know how you did it, hoss, but you pulled it off.
So what's the big surprise? You didn't rent this place for the weekend, did you?
I can do that.  I want to do that.  For all of us. I need to do that as a man...  Think about it.  No more lousy restaurants, no more clipping coupons, no more shoveling snow...
To Paris. Paris, France.
You're not married, are you?
No...
Someone's gonna have to nurse him through this.
I need you, tiger..
...we're really more of a boutique operation, as you can see...
He certainly has your number, Alan.
For one thing, you like expensive things.
Can I help you?
Damn...damn...damn...
Did you really mean what you said about Tuscany?
It's Christmas Eve, Jack.
I have to go to my parents' house out in Jersey.  Would you like to come?
You know, you could'a run an ad in the personals.
I'm not really dressed for a party.
How long was I out?
Ben, I'm afraid I've got to ask --
Ben, I've been crunching the numbers on the machine.  I think if we can rework the power settings...
Yeah, well, his eyes say different.
Hey!  That's a <u>prototype</u>!
No more cracks about how I look.
Deb... It's me.  I need you to step out front.
What did you wish for, honey?
What are <u>you</u> doing here?
Ben, come in.
What do you want, Vic?
Way to not overthink it.  So when do we leave?
I can handle the ship.  I can even handle Mr. Blonde Ambition.  But I don't know if I should be flying or playing Vegas in these suits.  Who the hell came up with them?
Your tissue, your organs, your entire biophysical structure is changing. Every system is still functioning, somehow --
At this rate, the infection should be complete in two, maybe three weeks --
Is there something about flames? About flaming, that you --
That's what I'm trying to calculate. And it's not rubber.  It's muscle, tendon.  I seem to have the ability to manipulate the malleability of my molecular structure and redistribute my density to --
You need to control yourself and <u>think</u> before you --
You two need a time-out.
Is that what you call it?  "<i>Real</i>"?
I'm sorry, sis, for leaving you guys --
Our numbers are through the roof.  The IPO's tracking at fifty, sixty a share.  The bank's five times oversubscribed --
Funny how things turn out, isn't it?
We've got <u>minutes</u> until it hits, not hours...Victor, that storm's <u>deadly</u> -- the radiation's lethal.  We need to abort.
Come on, Ben, come on...
Those solar winds are flaring, but I factored them into my coordinates and --
Well, uh, based on our history...you can handle the biogenetics, and I'll focus on the molecular physics.  Or, uhm, maybe I should take the biotech, you work the microscopes, since you have some background in electropho--
Sue.  Your clothes.  Lose them.
It's not "invisibility" per se. You're bending the light around you with some kind of malleable force field.  That's what you projected on the Bridge.
Okay.  Is there any way to duplicate that feeling?  Some memory or...
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do that... You must think that was some kind of latent hostility or --
What are you doing?
Uh, Victor, I hope I haven't done something to make you think...
Victor, I'm sorry I --
Victor, your scar --
Please don't make this personal --
We still have fifty-one minutes. Leave them in.
I told you to cut down on the sugar.
Benes... What the devil happened?
I can't even put a Band-Aid on my finger.
Duval. Dr. Peter Duval. Top brain man in the country. Ever hear of him?
But why take the chance, when there must be other doctors?
General, I've heard some wild ones. But this takes it.
Yes, Alan.
Listen...the Heart.
Never saw <that>. Not even under an electron-mrcroscope.
That'll teach you where to keep your hand.
That could be quite a lethal weapon... It could kill, not cure.
Looks like you didn't batten it down too well.
Then how come it worked loose?
Shouldn't you answer that?
You must carry spare parts --
No need to get up --
Thank you for saving my life.
Such as?
We better get back to the sub. Every second counts now.
Looks like the molecular structure of proteins.
What can we do?
What's that?
Only to the naked eye.  Those corpuscles -- carrying oxygen -- give the stream its color. But the rest of the plasma's very much like sea water. An ocean of life...
I'd hate to get lost on that Freeway...
Isn't there another surgical procedure you can try?
We'll never get there in time, at this rate.
Yes...  We can transfer over to the Inner Ear, and go by way of the Endolymphatic Duct.
You said there was a quick way out!
There it is!
Well, sir? Which is it? The wireless, or Benes' life?
Cough? If he can kick up a storm by just <breathing> --
Sabotage? I don't understand...
We're entering the Lymphatic System. Those are nuclei of cells, lining a Duct.
They're tracking us Topside. Once they see where we're going, I'm sure they'll take every precaution.
I can't tell you.
May I?
'Prepare for Miniaturization'...
Even so, because of our size -- I mean lack of it -- we'll still be cruising mighty fast. We'll be smashed to bits if there's any turbulence --
Captain, how will you be able to follow my charts --  --from up there?
We could never fight that current it's physically impossible.
...What do you mean, you decided not to park here?
I'm sorry, sir, we do have to charge you the four dollars.
I am through fucking around! Drop that fucking briefcase!
Drop that fucking money!
You're required to display temporary tags, either in the plate area or taped inside the back window.
...So maybe the best thing would be to take care of that, right here in Brainerd.
...Come on, man. Okay, here's an idea. We'll stop outside of Brainerd. I know a place there we can get laid. Wuddya think?
...Would it kill you to say something?
You'll take care of it. Boy, you are smooth smooth, you know.
Well, okay, it's -
Yah, well, that was a mix-up, then.
Yah. But it's not a whole pay-in- advance deal. I give you a brand-new vehicle in advance and -
...You-my point is, you pay the ransom- what eighty thousand bucks?  - I mean, you give us half the ransom, forty thousand, you keep half. It's like robbing Peter to play Paul, it doesn't make any -
Blood has been shed. We've incurred risks, Jerry. I'm coming into town tomorrow. Have the money ready.
That's wonderful. Mm-mm. It'll change your life, a course.
Well, Ecklund & Swedlin's, that's closer ta Moose Lake, so I made that assumption.
Oh sure. They say she's gonna turn cold tomorrow.
Uh-huh.
They said they were goin' to the Twin Cities?
A subconscious-type thing.
We're not horse-trading here, Wade, we just gotta bite the bullet on this thing.
Okay. We'll get the money together. Don't worry about it, Jerry. Now, d'you want anyone at home, with you, until they call?
So you're goin' to the Gophers on Sunday?
It's okay, Scotty. They're not gonna want to hurt her any.  These men, they just want money, see.
Dad, I really think we should call the cops.
Well, you can help me. My name's Marge Gunderson -
Okay, I'll do a damned lot count!
Yah, how much money was that?
Well, yah, I got an idea. How's that Ciera workin' out for ya?
Yah, Shep Proudfoot said -
Yah, you bet. It's in the lot there. Brand-new burnt umber Ciera.
Yah, how ya doin'. So, uh, we all set on this thing, then?
Wade, have ya had a chance to think about, uh, that deal I was talkin' about, those forty acres there on Wayzata?
I mean a parking lot.
Yah, well, it's a chunk, but -
No kiddin'?
Yah.
- All's I know is, ya got a problem, ya call a professional!
You're darned tootin'!
All the more reason!  I don't want you - with all due respect, Jerry - I don't want you mucking this up.
No, see -
Say, Shep, how ya doin' there?
Well, yah, but he had a buddy there. He, uh -
Yah, well, see, I did that, and I haven't been able to get 'em, so I thought you maybe'd know an alternate number or what have ya.
Hiya, Lou.
Yah, this guy's smaller than his buddy.
How's it look, Marge?
Heck, yah. Ya think, is Dave open yet?
...Last vehicle he wrote in was a tan Ciera at 2:18 a.m.  Under the plate number he put DLR - I figure they stopped him or shot him before he could finish fillin' out the tag number.
So I got the state lookin' for a Ciera with a tag startin' DLR.  They don't got no match yet.
Yah, that's a good one.
Gotta eat a breakfast, Marge.  I'll fix ya some eggs.
No, that's okay.
Yah - how are you doon?
Heck, it's been such a long time, Mike. It's great to hear from ya.
And then I, and then I been workin' for Honeywell for a few years now.
It's okay, Mike - Should we get together another time, ya think?
...I'm sorry... I shouldn't a done this... I thought we'd have a really terrific time, and now I've...
Well, associating with criminals, if you're the one they talked to, that right there would be a violation of your parole and would end with you back in Stillwater.
Oh. Oh, my.
Oh. Geez.
Oh, I'm almost back - I'm driving around Moose Lake.
Thanks, hon. Time to shove off.
Yah.
You shouldn't be on your feet too much, you got weight you're not used too. How's the food down there?
Was it reasonable?
They announced it?
It's just the three cent.
Yah, I guess.
Oh, my.
Boy, this thing is really... geez.
Cornelius!  How are you?
That's a fucking great, man!  Fucking great! Congratulations.
After fight club, everything else in your life gets the volume turned down.  You can deal with anything.
Is that your blood?
Hmm?
We need to talk.
This is Detective Stern with the arson unit.  We have some new information about the "incident" at your condo.
I don't know if you're aware... your front door -- it seems someone sprayed freon into the lock, then tapped it with a chisel to shatter the cylinder.
The dynamite...
It means it was homemade.
I want that.
Um... Marla, should we maybe exchange numbers?
Where have you been the last few weeks?
I found a new one.
This could go on for hours.
Except for their humping, Tyler and Marla were never in the same room.
What are you talking about?
Here.
Uh ... nah.
Really... I mean it.  Have you been going to your groups?
I don't understand.  Why does a weak person have to go out and find a strong person... to hang onto?
Guy or girl?
Why would you get bent if I asked?
What kind of stupid question is that?!
Is this a trick?
Marla...
Marla... I need to talk to you.  It's going to take a tremendous act of faith on your part for you to hear me out.
Sixty seconds, then I'm out of here.
Two sides?  You're Dr. Jeckle and Mr. Jackass.
I'm trying to tell you -- and this is where you have to trust me -- but, I think your life might be in real danger.
I'm not paying this back.  I consider it "asshole tax."
My God, you're shot...
Uh... I'm sorry.  We met on the plane.  We had the same briefcase. I'm... you know, the clever guy.
Baggage handlers.  But when a suitcase vibrates, the throwers have to call the police.
I had everything in that bag.  My C.K. shirts... my D.K.N.Y. shoes...
It's getting exciting now.
You see, when you travel, everything is small, self-contained--
I guess so.
I don't follow...
-- Like splicing single frames from adult movies into family films.
One-forty-eighth of a second.  That's how long it's up there.
Why not you?  I'm letting you go first.  Do it.
Alright, go crazy.  Let 'er rip.
Shit.  Sorry.  That didn't count.
If you could fight anyone... one on one, whoever you wanted, who would you fight?
My boss, probably.  Who would you fight?
Hemingway.  You?
Okay... Ghandi.
You?
Unbelievable, huh?
I mean, this girl... uh, you're not into her or anything... ?
Hey... don't knock librarians.
You want to finish her off?
I... I think I understand.  I think I get it...
Shut up.  Our fathers were our models for God.  And, if our fathers bailed, what does that tell us about God?
We don't need him...
Tyler...
Where did you go, Psycho-Boy?
Why wasn't I told about "Project Mayhem?"
I don't know!  Nothing!
What are you talking about?
The first rule of fight club is -- you don't talk about fight club.
No!  This isn't true.  We... we were around other people, together, both of us...
You took me to the house.
She's... you... you're fucking her.
The buildings were evacuated thirty minutes ago.  Everything's proceeding exactly as planned.
Tyler...
One minute.
I'm doing this for us.
Excuse me?
Abort the plan.
But, in Project Mayhem, we have no names.
His name is Robert Paulson!
He don't own this place, I do.  How much money's he getting for this?
What are you doing?!
Okay!  Okay, fuck it!  Use the basement!  Get off me!
Raymond K. Hessel. 1320 SE Benning, apartment A.  A small, cramped basement apartment.
It's not just about me.  Someone I saved died last night in a freak accident.  What if the others are in danger, too?
What list?
I didn't beat it; I hid from it. If you were smart you'd put a down payment on a burial plot and say goodbye to the dog, because what little life you have left is over as you know it.  Don't make new friends, don't fall in love, and don't ever bother trying to save others.  That's the worst killer of them all.
You have to tell us now.
I was driving a white van.  It must've gone out of control because it crashed into a lake and I drowned.  It was...horrible.
Are you crazy?  What makes you think you'd survive?
What do you want me to do?
What did you see?
Then the only way to survive is to get to the hospital and protect Eugene and Isabella for as long as we can.
So if you never got off the plane, none of us would be alive in the first place.
Calm down, Kimmy.  It's not drugs, just weed.
Look, you weren't there.  It was weird.  She knew that log truck was gonna cause an accident, she knew.  Never mind.
What?
Take a guess.
Here's what I don't get.  For nine months, Death does all this shit to make sure I win these tickets and end up on Route 18 at exactly the right time for the pile up...
Tell me again how it started.
Nora's not coming.  She refuses to leave her son.
Shit, I don't have her number.  She was never interviewed.  She took off right after the accident.
Stop it, don't move him!
This trip better be worth it. What's the guy-girl ratio again?
Relax, Dad.  It's Daytona, not Mongolia.
Kimberly?  It's Dad.
I know it's crazy, but I'm really scared for the others.  I've got this terrible feeling.
Damn, it really hurts, Mom.
You're all certifiable, you know that?  I can't believe I've been listening to this crap.  Come on, Tim, let's go outside.
It's only the end of June.
You went there? I've wanted to go there, but I thought it was off limits.
Not a likeness. It's how you make me feel, Alex.
That's why I was there last night.
"It?"
Ahhh! fuck! You fucking asshole. You think this is funny, you fucking dick? Tod, if you're not dead I'm gonna fucking kill you!
How many died on Flight 180?  From our group?
Those guys are probably fifteen minutes away.
You're payin' for my trip, Browning!
Alright, Browning, you fuckin' warlock... did you know about Ms. Lewton, or what?
Is knowing going to make it easier? It makes it harder.
Me, too.  But my dad doesn't understand. When he's better; you and me, road trip to the City. Catch the Yanks.
I believe that... Ms. Lewton's next.
Alex... can you promise me that no one else will die?
Cuticle lacerations.
His father's pretty fucked up with denial. Maybe he couldn't deal with the thought of an other accident... taking another son.
... there are no accidents. No coincidencess. No mishaps.  And no... escapes.
Hey, man, why'd you say that?!
It broke!
So, why'd you want us to meet you here? Now?
He didn't say nothin'. Just drive.
I gotta tell you, it's just luck you guys came when you did.  They move us around a lot... We only been at that camp a week.  Got a smoke?
You mean the snake?
What's that?
Again.
... then proceed downriver to extraction at point Echo Delta. Doyle takes us out by helicopter, we all live happily ever after and that's the last time, Rambo!  I swear to Christ.
You okay?
I've seen worse places.
What's this stuff on the rice?
Why would they send us to a deserted camp?
What's that?
Can't tell.  Pretty tall.  He's real scrunched up in that thing.
Roundeye.
Torture cage.  Can't stand... can't sit... for days.  Sometimes weeks.
Can you handle the door gun?
Christ.  How'd you get here?
You try get across Laos?  Get to Thailand?
I don't work with spooks.  Not after that op in Cambodia.
Where?
Memo E-7 on top will cover the details.  An abandoned Vietnamese Army base in the North-central highlands may have a compound used as an internment camp.  As you can see the intelligence is soft.  These LANDSAT photos show huts... barracks.  It could be anything.
This operation is in two phases. Recon and rescue.  You are phase one.  Your two-man team will probe the site, confirm the presence of American POWs, if any, make photographic and tactical observations, then proceed to the extraction point without engaging the enemy.
He's giving them a run for their money.  Says here they've got two Hueys from Danang.  I didn't know those dinks had Hueys.
Typical...
Um... actually, no.  It looks like he shot down one of their gunships...
... and then he, uh... took the other one.
How long have you been setting up?
What's up?
I know...
Take your time.
Rambo and Brewer were selected as write-offs.
"Terminate with extreme prejudice."
Hardcore outfit.  The best I ever trained.
Plus, what else?  Two Silver Stars, four Bronze Stars, two Soldier's Medals, four Vietnamese Crosses of Gallantry and... uh, a handful of Purple Hearts.
Listen up.  You two are married as of now.  Get used to it.
You know, I think I... ordered some just the other day.
...So he says to me, "you'll never find another man like me"...I said, "please, men like you have one hand on their dicks and the other hand on their mother's leg... I said, there's the door - take a trip.
Well, don't say it like that. It's not so...ya know, crazy an idea. You are a healthy woman... You hold a steady job. Ya not crossed eyed or anything...
What?
Tell me about it. I've been dating longer than I've been driving. I can't believe that.
No really..I can't.
Getting your nails done is one thing but going to dinner with a bunch of strangers and <u>him</u>... She didn't even look at him.
Are you in a mood today baby? Is this one of those days when you're in ...whadda call it... an emotional abyss?  Talk to me, cause I don't understand these moods.
Well, it's funny!  Whatta want from me?
I can't tell you how distraught I was.  All night long.  What the hell happened?
I'm not seeing anyone else.  I really was attacked.
... You have a little... uh... something on your face...
Can I have my desk please.
Lydia?!  Lydia who!?
You're calling <u>Lydia</u> in <u>my</u> office. You must think I'm some dope.  You fuckin' bastard... You...  ... stay out all night long...
Lydia is the girl Parry likes... And I thought, if I could get them together I...
All right... Sorry... I feel indebted to him.
Hello....congratulations.
You're kidding!  What did he say?
It's so great to see you like this, honey... I can't tell you.
What?
... Listen, so much has happened and I think it would be a good thing for both of us if we slowed things down a little.
... I'd like to focus on my career - - now than I can, now that everything's all right... Parry's taken care of... and... Like I said, I feel like I know a lot more now and I don't...
Oh yeah?  What did I get?  What did I get I couldn't've gotten from somebody with no name any night of the week?  You think your company is such a treat?  Your moods, your...  "pain", your problems... You think you're entertaining?
Well!  What do you want me to do - applaud?
Yeah so? The guy's beat up - he...he probably has a concussion or something, right?  He'll snap out of it?
No, Jack, no, it's not... She likes me.
Where you comin' from?!
You a friend of Parry's?
Remember. One chorus and out.
Isn't that awful? Poor Brenda Frazier. Poor Little Gloria. They ruined them! THEY ATE THEM ALIVE!
About dinner as a concept or about dinner with...  <u>Raoul</u>?
You know, tomorrow's a very big day for me... It would be nice if you acted like you understood.
They're putting me on film tomorrow.
How un-sixties of you.
Okay... twenty dollars... When can you...
Could you help me-- what was the name of that girl who just came in...
God, I have no idea.  She's worked here for fifteen years and I have no idea.  I'll call her.
Where -- ?
<u>What</u>?!
The Little...
Parry.
Thanks... You can keep the doll.
Do you follow her every day?
Why did you do that?
Well, I think you should be realistic. Ya can't start an ad agency on fifty dollars!
O.K...let me explain this one more time...The Holly Grail is in -....
Of course there is, Jack. What do you think the Crusades were - a frat initiation? I don't think so...There has to be a Grail.
...You are such a great guy. First the money, now this.  Isn't he fabulous!?
I'm self-centered, I'm weak - I don't have the will power of a <u>fly</u> on shit...
You can't do this! This is New York! Nobody lies in naked in a field in New York..It's...it's too Midwestern.
..Ha...Little fella? I mean the man talks to invisible people - he sees invisible horses - and he's naked in the middle of Central Park. I should be surprised? I'm not surprised. I'm fucking outta my mind to even be here!
I can't ask for her...I have to earn her.
Maybe, when we get the Grail...
Happily married, probably.
Beautiful night huh?
Unhand that degenerate - you adolescent ass of a one balled donkey!
You a fag too?
I advise you to let us go.
How about the "Hell Merchants"?
How about... Zbiegnew Speizak's "The Purple Bread," an intensely portrayed tale of love and envy set against the sweeping background of a Polish bakery.  In subtitles.
Well, no wonder.  We just met, made love and broke up all in the space of thirty seconds and I can't even remember the first kiss which is the best part.
So are you, but I think maybe you should shut up now...  ... I'm not coming up to your apartment.  That was never my idea.
... It's not just from tonight.  I've known you for a long time.  I see you come out of work every day.  I walk with you to lunch.  I know what you order... I see you buy Baby Ruths before going back in...  I know how you feel on certain days by whether or not you go into the bookstore...  ... I know you hate your job and you don't have many friends and you sometimes feel like you're not as... as wonderful as everybody else and you're a little uncoordinated  ... and feeling like you're the only one who's as separate and... alone as you are... and I love you.   I love you.  I think you're the greatest thing since... spice racks and I would be knocked out several times if I even got just a first kiss.  But I'll be back in the morning.  And I won't be distant.  And I will call if you let me... But I still don't drink coffee.
Cerveza.
Now, now.
Why'nt you take 'at sign off your tit, Ray, an' let's go on out.
You know what, you are never satisfied.
I'm tryin', baby, so don't start gettin' mad now.
Come on. We're goin' over to Elton's.
Okay. Hope no one hits on you.
I'm sorry.
You like it?
Why can't I go out to your folks' house? Give me one good reason.
Sure...
This certainly is an improvement on the motel an' the coffee shop.  How could you have left such a beautiful place, Bobby?
Just finish eating.
Bobby...
Come on.
Look at my car! Piece of shit! I just bought it brand new from a used-car lot, and the steering goes to the pot on me!
I saw a picture of it. Alaska is very clean. It appeared to look very white to me... Don't you think?
No. We have tomatoes.
I don't make the rules.
You want me to hold the chicken.
Tea.
Oh God, I'm so glad, Robert, that you're coming...
What questions?
Constantly. Night and day. And unless I get up before the birds, I can't get in any practice time for myself...
Actually, it's very admirable, the way she works. She'll probably be enormously successful, because she's attractive as well, not that that's so important in music, but...
Where is she, anyway?
It's none of your business!
You're leaving?
But what about me?
Besides piano and swimming, what else do you do?
That's right. Have you anything to suggest?
After that, I plan to read some music and rest for awhile.
Is that funny?
Why?
You had no inner feeling?
You think I'm a fake.
No, it isn't what I think.
Robert?
I could spend some time with you tomorrow morning, before Carl comes back, I mean, if you'd like to.
Where are you going?
I can't do that. I haven't been being fair to Carl. I have to tell you that.
I'm sorry everything's been so confusing, but I have to go, Robert...
Robert, do you mind?
Oh, for chrissakes...
Oh, no. You're more than welcome.
What's wrong, Carl, you hardly ate anything...
No, I wouldn't.
There'd never be a hole big enough. Now took at me, for instance, when I was just one person, before Bobby, I had so much garbage collectin' onto me every day, I was thinkin' about gettin a dispose all...
Salesmen and cops are the ones. If you'd ever waitressed, honey, you'd know.
You better hold onto your tongue!
And you know, I read where they invented this car that runs on... that runs on... when you boil water...
Miss Dupea.
I'd like to remind you again, this isn't an opera or a musical comedy.
I wanna go out with you, I want to be part of your life. I want you to treat me the way a girlfriend should be treated.
God, you drive me crazy. I just want you to know how I feel and you don't understand.
I told you, no. I'm not that type.
So you got a girl?
So what's her name?
So what you think of me?
See, I got you, you are so scared. I don't believe that you kissed no girls. That you got three girls and that you faithful and this and that.
Wussup?
So what girls are over there?
Where you goin'?
Oh man, what we gotta leave ar' own neighborhood for?
I gotta go take a piss.
I'm gonna punch you. What you want with her anyway? You in love with her?
Yo! What you goin' for
How does he look up close?
Yo, that's my girl.
Probably.  One of the many.
I feel like dirt. They even want to know what he's doing in Utah?
We'd have no way of knowing that, sir.
I don't know how he doesn't know. He doesn't know.
I wasn't asking.
I think that's highly unlikely, Creasy.
Hey you're really nuts.
Fletch.
Can I call my Mom? I'd like to tell here how much I've always loved her.
Speaking of which, you're not going to print anything before my investigation is through, are you?
Greetings, everyone.
This one's going to be even more fun.
I've got it all under control, Jerry. You can go now.
Arnold Babar. Isn't there a children's book about an elephant named Babar?
Oh, I don't belong formally. I've gone with my aunt.
Sure, but the end was so sudden.
Oh really, there's no need to -- we don't want to do that...
Whoa, look out there. You really need the whole fist?
Gee, Alan's been looking kind of sick lately. Is he all right?
Like when?
My pleasure.
Gonna need it. That boy is dangerous. Fletch?
It's me doctor Rosenpenis. I just have to take another peek at Alan Stanwyk's file. What have they done with this place?
Oh, God, I think I'm about to hyperventilate. Have you got a paper bag, or something.
I guess not.
Cash. I'm impressed.
And what was that?
I was already prepared to commit one murder. What makes you think I won't commit two?
Sure did. Dropped the big one on them.
Right.
I don't doubt it, Mr. Stanwyk. Actually, my company is the sub- insurer of the subsidiary carriers of a policy held by Alan Stanwyk, who I believe is your son.
Then he has.
I'm calling the police. Then I'm leaving. You wait here for them.
I really creamed the sonofabitch, didn't I?
John Ultramalensky, right?
God, I haven't seen you since the wedding.
I'm the Sufi.
Sure you did.
Where does the Chief get the drugs?
We can't talk about it here.
I'll give you a thousand dollars cash just to come to my house and listen to the proposition. If you reject the proposition, you keep the thousand, and your mouth shut.
It is nothing of a sexual nature I assure you.  One thousand, just to listen. I don't see how you could turn that down Mr...
Why don't you try suicide?
LAX. Go to the Pan Am desk. There will be a ticket waiting for you.
Yes. All you provide are the gloves, the passport, and the aim. I'll take care of everything else.
W-Y-K no 'c.' I'll be down in a minute.
My hero.
I just thought... sure.  Sally Ann Cavanaugh.
Cute young thing, too.
John who?
Why do you keep doing this?
What's he doing in Utah?
Who is it?
Hi.
You ordered it here?
I mean put clothes on.
Have you gotten cuter since I last saw you?
Lunch...
'But we're alone now, and I'm singing this song for you.'
Thanks, I feel much better. Listen, if you're so bored, why didn't you go to Utah with Alan?
What about his parents?
Thanks for the great time.
Wrong. He sold you $3,000 worth of scrub brush.
What are you talking about?
Wait a second. What am I supposed to do for twenty-four hours?
What's wrong, Gail?
Oh God, I hate things that start like that....
What is this....
And they're leaving the country tomorrow night.
You can't do that.
Would you care for a drink while you're waiting? I can put it on the Underhill bill.
Right. Tell you what -- have you caviar?
Your call is come through.
Where is she?
So you're saying she moved out.
Tell the cops.
Just kidding, Frank. You'll have the story and you'll be damn proud of it.
So let's go! We run the pictures.
Just give me a hint, all right?
More cops.  I think I gotta go to Utah, Frank.
I have some ideas.
This is Fat Sam, and this is Gummy. 
Who's Frieda?
You don't know the Underhills?
I just stepped out of the shower! Can you give me a minute?
But I ain't got you...
Ford Fairlane, I'm Colleen Sutton and I need your help.  I have a problem and it pertains to the music industry.  What is it they call you?  Mr. Rock and...
Sorry about the glass.  And the house.  And the breath.
Poor taste.  I know.  Listen, I respect homosexuals.  When I was young, my maid was a homosexual.  My maid was a homosexual.
Ah, the Dorothy Chandler.  I was just there with my good friend Art Mooney the other night...
So you know about Johnny Crunch and myself.
Listen, Queen Collie, I have a code. I never, ever, drop a case.  Besides, I, uh, used all your money to pay my bills, so I kinda owe you.
They did one of these about my ex- wife.  It's called 'The Nutcracker.'  'The Nut-crack-er'... I don't need money.  I need some questions answered.
That was close...
You gotta shave before you leave the house in a dress like that and I don't mean your legs.  Why didn't you jump on her?  What's happening to you?
Julian's happy as long as he doesn't see glass shatter.
Hey, Don, how's the high blood pressure.
All your friends call you Jazz.
I do it for love.
And it's good to see you, Julian. This is my assistant, Jazz.
I came to warn you...
I believe the last time we came across one of these, was at the ballet.  What were your words...  'A fucking C.D.  This case is closed.'
Your timing swallows the massive one. Grendel just tried to kill us, he's about to frame and kiss Don, and we can't do shit.  Don't even ask about those discs. Goddamn that Art Mooney with a star by his name!  It's tied to Johnny's C.D., I know.
Yeah, Colleen mentioned it.  What do they make?
I just can't deal with all this crap between us, I'm sorry.  I'm quitting.
Spunk, come back...
Because I know rock-n-roll.
Are you okay?
I'm afraid so, you want her?
Ick.
Hey.  God.  You're an asshole.
Fairlane, you gonna find out who killed the lead singer of Black Vomit?
These two guys in long cowboy coats and real nice suits.  I think Armani.  They were going through your stuff with screwdrivers and shit... I did what you would have done.
Hey, I love you, too, you little jerk.  Jesus, guy tries to make a commitment and he's gotta eat shit.
Two words.  Disco Express.
'Booty Time.'
Like me.
Oh.  One more thing.  This is personal.  I want you to tell me you're a big sissy.
How's it going?
Good to meet you, Mr. Fairlane. Your mouth makes quite a reflection.  I'm Julian Grendel.
Terrible thing, but good career move.  His record sales have gone way up.  I'll just have to create a new Black Vomit.
Well, hello, Ford.
Actually you're a bit off in the motivation department... I mean, revenge is so... Bronson.  Wait, where's the third C.D.?  How could you come here without proof? It's a three piece set here!  A computer disc from Colleen, Bobby's computer disc, and Johnny's computer disc.  Together they make, oh fucking forget it!
Yeah, it's pretty amazing how much cash you gotta give to the actual artists who create the music.  Those ingrates really take a bite.  But seriously, when Pops died, you got Vomit, Crunch, and Sutton to help finance a C.D. Cleans operation. You got greedy and they tried to get the three discs together to threaten you, but...
How nice.
'Bye, Johnny...
I am told it is difficult to pay the phone bill with gold chains and V.C.R.s.  There's four thousand here.
What?
How's everything?
What?
Henri c'est gentil d'?tre venu.  Je vous pr?sente mon associ?, Pierre Nicoli.  Henri Devereaux.
Mais non, c'est pour toi.
Le sommes nous?
Alain is the only man I know who can become as enthusiastic about a bridge as he can about a woman.
Are you sure it is dead?
If this bridge were in Europe, it would be on every tourist's sight- seeing list.
There may be two... no, three who could fit it.
A Mr. Paul Ganapolos, he's here alone.
Yeah.  In the late innings.  Ya look like a night's sleep wouldn't kill ya.
Christ you should o' collared him right there.
That's crazy.  You lost the Frog in the subway and you blew our cover. If they haven't moved already they're not gonna move now.
Who is that guy?
If that's not a drop or a pickup, I'll open a charge for you at Bloomingdale's.
Toy wit' this will ya.
No sir -- this is where Joel lives.
It's Cloudy.  Open the door.
The guy's a frog -- I'm pretty sure. Also he made me.  Stayin' on four but went up to six -- cute.
What about Sal?
This fella Nicoli's got a record in France, Walter.  He's wanted for questioning in the murder of a French cop.
My ass.  The only reason you're in this is because you've got a big expense account for buying junk and you like to see your picture in the papers.
Can you use a new suit for Christmans?
It was a crematorium.
Sexual assault, Daryl.  Five years.  But you got lucky, right?  You got away with something else.  Something you figured nobody knows about.
I'm working with one of the victims outta Brooklyn North.  You mind I take a shot at him?
Where's the collar, in the cells?
Oh, yeah.  Damn.  My watch is busted.
Butch called.
I love you, Bud.
I've been talking to Johnny...on the radio.
Hey, bud.
Lucky throw, fire boy.
What do you mean?
I wanna be wrong here.  But we need to go to the precinct and talk about it.
Frank, this is not the time to be worried about covering up if you had a thing with this girl.
Okay, start pedaling.
You ready?
Are you licensed to broadcast, buddy?
Where are you transmitting from?
What?
What are you talking about?  I'm talking about this afternoon.
What'd you say your station...uh, your call letters were?
Oh my god.
Thirty-five?  That would make it...
You're still my Little Chief, right?
On the job?
When?
Dad...?
When?
What kinda twisted animal.
I'll warn them.
I'll be damned.
Whatta we do now?
How?
Hang on a sec, John.
John, you still there?
I don't think I can.  I'm not a cop.  I can't.   I can't stop this guy.
He took your wallet?
We got him!  Dad you got him!
Please, Dad, just do it.
I got it.
You're telling me this maniac is a cop? What the hell am I supposed to do with that one?
John, you there?
Wait.  Something's wrong.  I don't...
C'mon, man.  Get inside.  I'll come over. We'll play some Nintendo.
How you feeling?
Huh?
Our lucky break.  Mario ID'd the dental. Mary Finelli...reported missing April 16, 1968.
Which means he probably knew her.
What?
So how'd you like LION KING?
Are you a good cop, John?
Huh.
Who the fuck is this?
That's an eyeball!  Oh, God!
Who brought up this bright idea?
Why don't we go take a swim?
How about you and I whacking a couple of balls around?
That was the best yet.  Was it you... me... or the hammock?
I'm a slow eater.
Which one is it?
I appreciate the fact that you worry about me, but don't.
You haven't changed a bit.  Always so sure of yourself.  Even when we were kids, when you wanted something, nothing could stop you.
This door was open just a minute ago, wasn't it?
No.  I got here just before you did.
You know, I'm not sure I could live anywhere else.  The nights are always so peaceful and quiet.
Why did you come back here?
Could we move a little faster?
Are they following us?
I don't see anything.
This has been on helluva beginning to a quiet weekend in the country.
Darren, we better turn around.
That's right.  Just drive toward him.  He'll move.  Nobody wants to die.
Oh, jeez.
It's kinda frightening to think that a kid like that can go so far over the edge.  Jason really screwed up the poor sonofabitch's mind.
Is that all you found?
Of course not.  If he hasn't already accidentally pelleted himself, I'm sure he's lost.
But, Dad, we...
How do you know?  Did you take his temperature?
Can't you at least call the camp and make sure everything's all right?
So what happened?
It's just that Darren and Lizbeth are in charge of organizing and setting up the new campgrounds.
So where's Cort gone off to?
Aren't you the kid whose mother and friends were....
I sympathize with you kids.  The best I can do is call the station in Carpenter and have them keep a lookout for them.
Yes!
I gotta show you Jason's grave.
You got me where you want me. There's no reason not...
-- But this time they bombed him and then cremated the body.
No, I --
You need to leave.
Steven buggin' you?
Ed...
Jesus!
Tell me!
Does he know about what happened?
Steven, c'mon, we're not thirteen...
Wanna know how I did that?
Well?
Don't do anything stupid.
I'm gonna get your outta this.  Just hang tight.  Okay?
Oh, my dear God...
I've told you the truth.
I didn't kill her!
She asked me to come over.  She said she had something to tell me.
What's going on? I heard on the P.A. system that...
Time to check out the waiters.
Right.
What's that?
Dear Christ...
Jason's here in New York.
Where did you get that alcohol?
That's it. You're not setting foot off this ship until we return home.
I demand to know what is going on...
What are you doing??
He's doing the best he can, Charles.
Oh, he is indeed. And ready to pull down anybody who falls in and can't swim.
Facing your fear doesn't always conquer it.
Get in the boat, Rennie!
I'm glad you decided to come after all.
Did you know that I'm giving up teaching?
When did this start?
I've got the numbers.
It's okay...you're going to be okay.
Can he really take us home?
What about you?
I think so. But we have to lower the anchors so we don't drift any further...
I didn't mean for you to go!
I used to be head of neurosurgery. Big hospital in USSR. This hospital, I'm not kidding.
I opened thousands of brains.
Crosstown.
We must abandon.
I never left the garage without my Windex.
You're an artist. I'm a craftsman.
Do you want me to tell you what it was like, reading that review at the newstand with trucks rumbling past and street vendors facing Mecca?
I think we Nought to wait.
You say we go?
I'm not a lonely spooky writer like you. Nursing a hundred grudges. I'm a man who loves life.
In other words why should we suffer silently at this kind of abuse? The man is out there ruining lives.
Shoot him.
What do you mean?
Let's work on it.
This could be it.
That's not all, Nicky. I've been backing your plays for fifteen years. And I've never been more depressed.
I used to tell myself. Talent is more erotic when it's wasted. Will I see you tonight?
Is it?
She's doing like those Iranians. `I divorce thee. I divorce thee. I divorce thee'
She is kicking you out.
And you blame me. It's because we never talk. Let's talk.
I have this thing where I have to know a person is being honest with me before, you know, I can feel completely free to be myself.
Am I really so deeply repugnant?
See, Daddy.
Your father said you might be here.
I've been looking for you because I want to let you know what's been going on before you read about it in a gossip column.
I had an affair -- are you sure you want to hear this?
I'm a man. She's, you know, a woman.
It was an animal thing. No real intimacy.
It's Stanley. It's the Steamer. Fate has spoken to this man in the depths of the night.
Lillian says it once a week. `Why doesn't he come live with us?'
I do know the answer to that. Why don't we watch the ball game later? We'll go to Mannion's.
Remember 1949? Last two games of the season. Against the Yankees. The Sox lost on Saturday. Then they lost on Sunday. First I cried for twenty-four hours. Then I had fist- fights the rest of the week.
It's all connected, Pop. It's one life. Baseball is memory. How do fathers and sons show their love? They go to a ball game together. Thirty-five years later, they sit in the kitchen and remember.
Hey, Pop. I know you don't like the commotion of opening night. But I especially want you to see this play. It's new territory for me. And for you too. I have to know what you think.
Where's your elastic brace?
I was in a hurry to do big things, make big mistakes. Any mistakes were okay as long as it was big. But I'm trying to see these things clearly and honestly. That's the play they're going to kill starting tonight. There's a guy out there getting ready to rip it apart. And that's us. Who we were and where we come from.
Some little kid stole the hubcaps.
You're charming the boy.
You're a family man, Frankie?
It's a complicated subject.
You're afraid to risk believing. Believe in them. Believe in your self. Take a risk. It will humanize you as a person.
Say it and you'll believe it. Life is good. Say it.
Then say it.
I don't know.
This is something no one has been privileged to see in almost seventy years. Very few people now alive can say that they have seen what you are about to see, Matthew. The Red Sox win a World Series. This is deeply, intensely personal. All the mistakes I've made, all the envy, fear and violence that's encased in this little envelope we call a person -- all washed away in the next few minutes. And your grandmother knows why.
All the times I died when the Red Sox lost an important game they should have won. All the awful things I said to my mother and father. To Tmy wife and daughter.
Because life is good.
Don't worry. It's a test.
This could be it!
They're my team, too. I grew up on Boyleston Street. Right by Fenway Park. I went to fifty or sixty games a year. All by myself. I was one of those kids with scabby elbows. I called out to the players. `Look over here. Hi, I'm Steven. My parents are divorced.'
Postpone. We have every right.
Finally, I get a waiter who doesn't know "Macbeth".
Yes.
You have to see the words. Try to build a mental picture of the script. Imagine your lines high- lighted with a felt tip pen.
You know what.
You keep slipping away. How do you do that?
I was all noise. Played the radio loud. Battled constantly with my brother and sister. Here I am, world.
So do I. Over and over.
Would you like to meet him?
Is it true?
You've come to me. I wanted to believe you would one day.
Yes. I've seen your victims. One past and one future. I thought I might convince you to reconsider.
Stay. Teach me to be compassionate.
Sora was sent to tell me I -- I must rake and cover the latrine.
It is the work of untouchables.
Is my finger supposed to be wrapped around that?
You really are going to Pakistan, then?  You are a stubborn man.
You'd be Gandhi --  ...I thought you'd be bigger.
That's the sort of thing you'll be seeking on this "farm"...
No violence, please.
If I want to be one with them, I have to live like them.
They're calling you "Bapu." I thought it meant father.
What was he like?
Tell me -- do you think about hell?
I don't believe it -- even the British can't be that stupid!
Well, it's quite a place, your "ashram" -- is that right?
It's beautiful.
Are you going to walk all the way?
Do you find me stubborn?
After what they did at the massacre -- it's only an eye for an eye.
They are preparing for war. I will not support it, but I do not intend to take advantage of their danger.
We need your help!
Good. Good.  I have thought of calling for a Royal Commission to "investigate" the new legislation.  I think I could guarantee they would recommend the Act be repealed.
And that's the basis of this "Declaration of Independence"?
He's addressed this letter directly to you, has he?
Have you read his magazine?
Bapu, for me, and the rest,  if that is what you want, we will accept it. But out there  already there is rioting because Hindus fear you are going to give too much away.
According to this, he's a sick man.  Congenital heart condition.  Who knows how long the specimen has been here but there's an 80 percent chance the owner of that eyelash has already died himself from natural causes.
Since going underground, traces of this In-Valid have shown up at the scene of four serious felonies.  Do you need any more than that?
That's the last.
From what budget?
What are you waiting for?
We found his spit in the dead director's eye. He's signed a confession--supplied us with the suit he wore on the night.  What more do you want?
We believe we have a suspect.
One look through there and you would know why I can't possibly allow you to disrupt operations any further.
Hello.
Good to see you're feeling better.
You wish.
I gotta stop!!  I gotta stop!!
A day or so.
Up there they wouldn't be a problem.
It's all right.
--You don't understand, they'll make the connection, they'll hoover again.  We should cut our losses.
How was your evening?
You <i>are</i> a catch.  No doubt she's worried that she would lower the standard of your offspring. Everybody wants to "breed up".  What's wrong with her?
Hello?
I understand.  That's already been taken care of.  Now you appreciate I can only work with the raw material I have at my disposal but for a little extra...I could also attempt to insert sequences associated with enhanced mathematical or musical ability.
He has the heart of an ox.  He could run through a Goddamn wall--if he could still run. Actually, he was a big college swimming star.
No problem.  Before he dropped out he was an honor student, the right majors--

Hugo!  I've found him!
I'm sorry.  I didn't mean anything.
It was a mercy-killing after all.
Perhaps we ought to celebrate, Irene.
Of course I think about it every day.
So you didn't do it after all.
What <i>is</i> this place?
Why are we leaving?
My medication.  I left it back there.
So you're not so smart after all.  I want you to know--if it ever came to it-- I'd be willing to get an ovum from the Egg Bank.  In fact, I'd <i>rather</i> use a donor egg--  --<i>if</i> it came to it.
--when you go away.
If everything goes to plan, this could be the last time I see you for a while.  One week to go.  Please tell me you're the least bit excited.
Flight got you nervous?
Just remember, Lamar, I could have gone up and back and nobody would have been the wiser--
What about them?
What about your wife?
The obvious.  But we are both not interested in that right now.
We'll try again.
Hello, Doc.
You want to drive?
I'm sorry I was late... I got my hair done... the girl was slow.
I hope so. I am not looking forward to another stretch.
Half a million.
What do you want for dinner?
That's not all of it.
You go out much?
I was going to fix you breakfast.
$250,000 right off the top.
That doesn't hurt.
I didn't. I just waited.
You know how I feel?
It will be such a relief not to have to think about it any more.
I mean it.
They checked in.
I don't want to go there.
Yeah.
Who's she?
If you don't start telling the truth... 
Texas is a big state.
When we had trouble before it was different.
We'll grab a room for tonight then you go out tomorrow and buy yourself some new clothes, pick some up for me... Grab some food now, paper bag it, we eat in the room.
How much?
Okay?
We've got some food coming, should be here any minute.
You're crazy.
Come on, come on.
I don't know, airport I guess.
You wouldn't be taking the train to Salt Lake, would you?
STANDS AND PAUSES FOR A MOMENT.
One thing though... how do I explain this to my wife?
Can I help you?
Chicago.
What do you have in mind?
My lady'11 come in in about five minutes. Have some food sent up in half an hour.
When she gets here, have that kid of yours help her with the suitcase.
How was that?
Let's just get to the border.
How about if I buy your car for ten grand?
Well, I paid a hell of a price. Now for God's sake keep your mouth shut.
What kind of car do you have, Harold?
You can trust him...
Something ought to loosen him up ... how comes we're going to El Paso, Rudy?
I didn't know who Doreen was. Thought she was just another bird.
Yes.
What did you do?  Albert?
You knew what I'd do.
Oh ay?
You know what the bloody time is!  It's two o'clock in the bloody morning!
Jack?
Confidential, like.
Everyhing go off all right?
But he was just another feller, wasn't he?
Once a week you like a gentleman?
It is. Honestly.
You know Sid Fletcher?
You know Sid Fletcher?
Yes.
He came to see Mr Kinnear.
What does he want that bloody great country place for?
Tell me about the girl.
Did my brother Frank find out?
Let her go. She'll be OK.  Sorry about that.
How's school?
You all right now?
You coming to South America?
I couldn't believe it when I heard. Carter is suddenly attentive.
I mean, I was surprised when he didn't turn up for work.  He was always on time.
Keith, if anybody comes in here and asks for me, you let me know. Right?
I'm at the Las Vegas. Behind the dance hall.  Do you know a man called Albert Swift?
Ah, Edna, come in. Join the tea set.
All right. All right. I want to square things with you first.
Is he staying the night?
Suppose you tell me what the bloody hell's going on. It's my house, you know.
Now just a minute...
You sod.
Thorpey nearly died laughing.
What you going to do?
Do you want breakfast?
Did you sleep well?
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
They're still the same. Piss holes in the snow.
Cyril didn't like it, either.
You couldn't win an egg and spoon race, Eric.
Do you know, I never knew he worked in one of my places!
Bollock naked with his socks still on?
Ask me?
What's that?
All right. Two hundred.
What's that?
Deadbeats all.
You get those names come up, you ever get 'em, "Patel?"
They did.
I...
And it's not right to the customers.
...that's right...
Who?
So Graff buys a fucking list of nurses, one grand--if he paid two I'll eat my hat--four, five thousand nurses, and he's going wild...
River Oaks, Brook Farms.  All of that shit.  Somebody told me, you know what he's clearing himself? Fourteen, fifteen grand a week.
That's what I'm saying.  Why?  The leads.  He's got the good leads... what are we, we're sitting in the shit here.  Why?  We have to go to them to get them.  Huh.  Ninety percent our sale, we're paying to the office for the leads.
That's the God's truth.  And it gets me depressed.  I swear that it does.  At MY AGE.  To see a goddamn: "Somebody wins the Cadillac this month.  P.S. Two guys get fucked."
Yes.
How many leads have we got?
Yes.  I mean are you actually talking about this, or are we just...
We're just "talking" about it.
As a "robbery"?!  No.
You're actually talking about this?
Yes.
He'd give me a job.
Oh, yes, George.
In the abstract...
I, you know, they should be insured.
Yes.
Where criminals can come in here... they take the...
You think they're going to catch... where are you going?
He said we're all going to have to go talk to the guy.
He said we...
Yes.
Thieves.
They're inured to it.
That's what, that's what, that's what I was trying to do.  That's why I came in...I meet gestapo tac...
Excuse me, fella.
Would you excuse us, please...?
Moss...Who told him?
Aaronow...
You have a problem?
The people downtown said...
Would you come in here, please?
Hey, hey, hey, easy friend.  That's the "Machine." That is Shelly "The Machine" Lev...
...I only...
...and I'm going to get bounced and you're...
That's fucked.  That's fucked.  You don't look at the fucking percentage. You look at the gross.
Bullshit, bullshit, you assign them... What are you telling me?
Of what?
I will close.
I will close.
No.
Look: I have a lot of things on my mind, they're coming in, alright, they're very upset, I'm trying to make some sense...
What are you trying to tell me?
If you tell me where the leads are, I won't turn you in.  If you don't, I am going to tell the cop you stole them, Mitch and Murray will see that you go to jail.  Believe me they will.  Now, what did you do with the leads?  I'm walking in that door--you have five seconds to tell me: or you are going to jail.
The check's no good?
Why?
...the fuck is that supposed to mean...?
I got 'em in the kitchen.  I'm eating her crumb cake.
Rick.  Let me tell you.  Wait, we're in the...
Get the chalk.  Get the chalk...get the chalk!  I closed 'em!  I closed the cocksucker.  Get the chalk and put me on the board.  I'm going to Hawaii!  Put me on the Cadillac board, Williamson!  Pick up the fuckin' chalk.  Eight units. Mountain View...
Shelly...!
Williamson, get on the phone, call Mitch...
Just now.
How was it...?
You closed 'em today?
And, and, and, I did it.  And I put a kid through school. She...and...Cold calling, fella. Door to door.  But you don't know. You don't know.  You never heard of a streak.  You never heard of "marshaling your sales force..." What are you, you're a secretary, John.  Fuck you.  That's my message for you.  Fuck you and kiss my ass. You don't like it, I'll go talk to Jerry Graff.  Period.  Fuck you. Put me on the board.  And I want three worthwhile leads today and I don't want any bullshit about them and I want 'em close together 'cause I'm going to hit them all today.  That's all I have to say to you.
Oh, Christ.
You're a client.  I just sold you five waterfront Glengarry Farms.  I rub my head, throw me the cue "Kenilworth."
I own the property, my mother owns the property, I put her into it. I'm going to show you on the plats. You look when you get home A-3 through A-14 and 26 through 30. You take your time and if you still feel.
Glad to meet you.
You're sure?
Ah.  Ah, his wife is.  Ray: what time do you have...?
No.  You said the one.  That's why you said we couldn't talk till Kenilworth.
I'm sorry...?
I've wanted to talk to you for some time.  For a long time, actually. I said, "The Machine, there's a man I would work with.  There's a man..." You know?  I never said a thing.  I should have, don't know why I didn't.  And that shit you were slinging on my guy today was so good...it...it was, and, excuse me, 'cause it isn't even my place to say it.  It was admirable...it was the old stuff.  Hey, I've been on a hot streak, so what?  There's things that I could learn from you. You eat today?
Ricky, I...
It's funny, you know, you get a picture of the Corporation-Type Company Man, all business...this man, no.  We'll go out to his home sometime.  Let's see.  Tomorrow.  No.  Tomorrow, I'm in L.A....Monday...I'll take you to lunch, where would you like to go?
No, I'm saying you don't include Saturday...in your three days. It's not a business day.
When did you write the check?
I told you.
She wants her money back.
I'm...
You cashed the check?
Cop couldn't find his dick two hands and a map.  Anyone talks to this guy's an asshole...
Guess what the Machine did?
Fuck you.
We haven't got a lead...
Have a good trip.
They got, listen to me...
It went down.  I filed it.
I have the stuff from last year's...
I don't "want" it, if you catch my drift.
What's the fucking point in any case...?  What's the point.  I got to argue with you, I got to knock heads with the cops, I'm busting my balls, sell you dirt to fucking deadbeats money in the mattress, I come back you can't even manage to keep the contracts safe, I have to go back and close them again...What the fuck am I wasting my time, fuck this shit.  I'm going out and reclose last week's...
Yes.
But in actuality, you were a member of the Corleone Crime organization.
What position did you occupy?
What took so long?
Do you think he'd be satisfied with the two hundred dollars?  I think he would.
What if we don't pay?
Constanzia.  We expected you last week; we sent the car to pick you up at the airport last week.
Honey!  Wait a minute; let's go for a drive.
Whatsamatter, you don't want me to dance with him 'cause he's a man!
Don Francesco.  You murdered my husband, because he would not bend. And his oldest son Paolo, because he swore revenge.  But Vitone is only nine, and dumb-witted.  He never speaks.
The child cannot harm you.
Gee, Frankie, it's good to see you. Reminds me of old times.
Great, Havana's great.  Lots of activity in Havana!  Anybody I know here.  Five-Angels?  Anybody?
No.  No, I didn't.  Who tells me anything?  I been kept in the dark so long, I'm getting used to it.
Count on me; that's my specialty.
Jeeze, it's great you came along, Mike... You know, we've never spent a night out on the town together. I always thought you looked down on me for liking a good time.
Mike, I got something special up my sleeve for these boys.  You ever hear of &quot;Superman?&quot; And I don't mean the comic book.
You?  What do you mean you, I thought...
You?  What do you mean you, I thought...
No.  I mean, are you sure?
Tonight we've been invited to a reception at the Presidential Palace; to bring in the New Year. You and I will go in a special car that's being sent.  They'll have cocktails... then dinner, and a reception with the President.  When it's over, it will be suggested that you take Questadt and his friends from Washington to spend the night with some women.  I'll go home alone in the car; and before I reach the hotel, I'll be assassinated.
It wasn't the way I wanted it!  I can handle things.  I'm not dumb Christ, not like everyone says. I'm smart; and I want respect.
I know what you are thinking, Vitone, but you don't understand yet how things are.  Fanucci is of the Black Hand.  Everyone in the neighborhood pays him, even my father.
For you, she is beautiful.  For me, there is only my wife!
It's Michael's request...for your safety.  We can send out for anything you need.
Within the compound will be fine.
Kay, Michael didn't tell me a lot; and what he did tell me, I can't repeat.  But the responsibility for you and the kids was the most important thing he left me with.
I don't know.  I'm sorry, Kay...
What kind of a family is this... are we human beings?  He knows his Father killed his Uncle Carlo.  He heard Connie.
Rocco!
I don't think so.  Unless I'm very wrong...they're already dead. Killed by someone inside...very frightened that they botched it. That's why I am going to disappear in a few minutes, and leave everything to you.
Do you think they have somebody to back up Cicci?
They can come in now.
Go on, tell me.
What is it, can't you give me straight answers anymore!
How did they get their hands on Pentangeli?
I want it met.
They are everywhere!
It might show.
...and the tape will be running.
No strings.
No one can trace anything to me; I pride myself on that.
Kay.
How's the baby?
Where?
Why too late?
I won't let you leave!  Christ, do you think I'm going to let you leave.
We'll go back tonight.  Bring the children.
You missed my point; you are no longer an owner.
It's Michael.  How are you, Mom?
My concern is that the three million never arrived at Batista's numbered account in Switzerland. He thinks it's because you have second thoughts about his ability to stop the rebels.
This is it!  We think it makes Vegas look like the corner crap game.
I know.
Says who?
Clemenza promised them nothing, he hated the sonsuvbitches.
The Rosatos are running crazy; taking hostages, spitting in my face, because they're backed by the Jew in Miami.
My lawyer, Tom Hagen.  He arranged this all through your man Turnbull.
We'll try.
On the phone?
I'm a little hungry, maybe I'll order something.  Joe.  Get me some bracciole or something. And pay cash.  And in return for these concessions, what do you do for me?
Pari Persu; what the fuck is Pari persu...?
What if I say shove it?
I accept your generosity...
What makes you say that?
I've gotten to know someone who's famous.
Don't worry, you already paid me. I'm here because --
It's your job, lady, not mine.  I'm here so he can draw my picture.
What're you talking about?
Got a lawn this afternoon, but I'm free until then.
Oh, I don't know.  Because no girl in her right mind will have me?
That is why he must go to hell.  I do not think it fair.  But God's law is not for us to judge.
It's not what you think.
Thanks.  Why do you do it?
He wanted me to kill him, but I didn't.  He did it himself.
You must leave.  You were not here this morning.
My name is Whale.  This is my house.
Or would you prefer a beer?
Excuse me, but -- are you famous?
They're just copies then.  Gotcha.
Sure, everybody does.  When I was a kid I'd go with my sister twice a week.  Why?  Were you an actor or something?
You must excuse me for staring, Mr. Boone.  But you have a marvelous head.
You went to university?
I apologize for going on like this. It's the Sunday painter in me.  Of course I can understand your refusal.  It's a great deal to ask of someone.
All right then.  Sure.  I could use the extra dough.
"Bride of Frankenstein."
We could wrap this like a toga around your shoulders.  Would that help you overcome your schoolgirl shyness?
You have to excuse me, Mr. Boone. Since my stroke, I am often overcome with nostalgia.
I liked it.  We all did.
It's nothing to be ashamed of, in the service of one's country. That's something to be proud of.
So we understand each other?
Sorry.  Not today.
Very well put.
You might not think it to look at me now, but there was a time when I was at the very pinnacle of my profession.  The horror movies were behind me.  I'd done "Show Boat." Major success.  Great box office. Now I was to do something important.  "The Road Back."  An indictment of the Great War and what it did to Germany.  It was to be my masterpiece.
But I chose freedom.  David was still in the thick of it, his life full of anxiety and studio intrigue.  I didn't fancy spending my golden years as merely "the friend."  The dirty little secret of a nervous producer.
The extras are in their places. Now we need the star.  Wouldn't you like to get in the pool?
Everybody has stories to tell.
Not at all.  I was in the foxholes myself.
Why do I tell you this?  I never told David.  I never even remembered it until you got me going.
If you don't mind driving, I'd like to take you as my guest.  There should be lots of pretty starlets to keep you amused.
You're much wider than I am.  You won't want to attempt to get into my pants.
The morning after Pearl Harbor, he drove down to St. Louis to reenlist.  He was so damn excited. World War II was going to be his second chance.  They told him he was too old...fat ...nearsighted.  Said he'd be more use to his country if he stayed home and looked after his family.
I figured he'd think, you know -- it was the next best thing.  Hey, I loved it too.  A chance to be a part of something important. Something bigger than yourself.
That's from your movie, right? "The only monsters are here."
But that was so long ago.  It can't still bother you.
I don't know.
Just take off the fucking mask!
Break my neck.  Or strangle me.  It would be oh so easy to wrap your hands around my neck and choke the life out of me.  Please, Clayton. We've come this far.
Need some help?
I can undress myself, thank you.
This kisser wasn't so bad you couldn't lay under it a few times.
You coming, Boone?
Go home, Clay.  We're closing up.
Where's Betty?
I'm sorry, Jimmy.  But with this movie and two difficult stars --
Oh dear.  I'll never work in this town again?
But I have no reputation.  I'm as free as the air.
Jimmy, there are people here I need to speak to.  You'll be fine on your own?
My God.  Is the audience to presume that Colin and I have done her hair?  I thought we were mad scientists, not hairdressers.
Is that Boris?  Our little chum appears to be arranging a reunion.
We'll be in touch, Jimmy.
Hanna?  Who's the new yardman?
There is iced tea, Hanna?  Cucumber sandwiches?
You must think I'm terrible, Hanna.
Who was that at the door?
Mr. Boone.  He is an interesting friend.
And this is your house.  Wow.  The house of Frankenstein.  I thought you'd live in a spooky old mansion or villa.
That's my favorite line in my favorite movie of yours.  "Bride of Frankenstein."
That's funny, Mr. Whale.
Then the rumors are true?
Don't be shy.  There's time to stop before you go too far.
You, Mr. Kay?  How do you know George Cukor?
My monsters?
Oh dear.  Have I made a blunder?
It's about my brother ... Kip...
I can come up with the front money. Pay you back...
I'm just here about my brother.
I don't want them hurt. Any of 'em...
They just brought in Donny Astricky. Shot by a jacker ...
You want to come along quiet?
You're thinking: okay, there's no want ... But they probably stripped its guts and crated 'em up, right ... ?
I'm on the move -
I want you gone, Randall. Settle your affairs. Make it right with those you love. Hell, take 'em with you. But I want you out of here. Out of here for good this time ...
What's this -- ?
What's wrong with it -- ?
When'd you get to town, Raines?
It just ain't happening --
I guess ...
Diane 1.
You ever feel bad about any of this?
C'mon, Donny... Let's go, man --
For real. Okay. Gimme COLUMBO...
Damn. Memphis Raines. Long time ...
All I get are the Orientals. They can build 'em, but they can't drive 'em So? What are you doing here? What's with the outfit -- ?
Eleanor is Memphis' "unicorn."
How's it going -- ?
We're on a truncated time-table. Take a day to shop it; a day to prep it ... And we're still going to need to expand the crew...
Any word, Kip -- ?
What does that mean -- ?
Okay, okay. What about MAGNUM P.I.?
Have you seen him?
He's in some trouble ...
D.W.P. Thanks for holding. How can I help you?
okay, sir. Let me just get the-order. Yes. We'll be doing some work out your way. We've got a power leak. And it's unsafe. We're moving residences to the... Marriott Long Beach ... Just for the night ...
Breakfast brunch -- ?
Okay, then ... I just go to the Marriott and I'm set ...
We'll take it...
Hey, Kip, what's up?
It looks just like a regular Mustang --
Any more ...
Kip -- ?
You all right -- ?
All my enemies own car crushers. It's like a pre-requisite ... Owwww...
You?
You?
What are you doing here?
We do this. Then. You're finished. Then. You're clean
What about just getting a job, 9 to 5, five days a week, that whole mystery achievement -- ?
You want me to buy her?
Where you off to -- ?
Thirteen down ... Thirty-seven to go ...
Pop the trunk, Tumbler.
Now what -- ?
He give you an advance -- ?
You know of one -- ?
"Mitch?"
I go with you --
What the hell's that -- ?
Stop. What about Maserati Boy?
Where to -- ?
This time it's for real?
You think it can be done?
Tell me...
What happened to Sway?
The 167 Mustang Shelby Mustang GT-500.
What about me?
You know what you got here?
Uh ... Randall -- ?
What are you doing here, assface?
What? What happened?
But he was always a bad kid, that one.
Tell him. It's okay.
I don't want any more of that Shit.
I know what you did inside. You did what you had to do. I'm not talking about that.  I'm talking from now on, outside. I'm talking right here.
I'm not going to get fucked like Gribbs. He's seventy years old and the fucking guy is going to die in prison.  I don't need that. I don't care who it is. I'm warning everybody. Gribbs got twenty years just because he said hello to some fuck who was sneaking around selling junk behind his back. That's not going to happen to me.  You understand?
I warned you a million times.
Talk? To you? After what you did!
My bag. My bag.
The bag with the envelopes.
I had everybody working.  Even our old babysitter.
What are we going to do with him? We can't dump him in the street.
Keep 'em coming.
we're gonna feed the bastard to the lions.
For Christmas. Your share.  It's just a taste.
Oh yeah? Anything you say.
Where'd you find such creeps?
Batts's made. His whole crew is going to be looking for him. This is fucking bad.
Tommy, come on. Put the gun away.
How is he? Okay? Are they busting his chops?
I gotta talk to him as soon as I can.
If he was so grown up he'd get you two an apartment.
Do?  What can you do?  What did you expect?  He wasn't Jewish. Did you know bow they live?  Your father would never stay out this late without calling.  In thirty years he never stayed out all night.
Don't worry about the schools. We'll take care of the schools.
Someday they'll get what's coming to them. That's the only way they'll stop.
--Yah, restructurin' the amount of retards they had workin' for them.
When's the arraignment?
Thanks, Chuck.
Are they hookin' you up with a job?
It's a way outta here.
Okay.
Is that true?
--That isn't funny--
Jesus.
Would you shut the fuck up! I know what you ordered, I was there!
What do you mean "your sandwhich?" I bought it.
How much money you got?
My uncle can probably get you on my demo team.
What'd you say about me?
So why do you think I should work for the National Security Agency?
What is it?
--Maker builds "K" to the "N." N is three to the K times--
Excuse me. Is this the buildings and grounds office?
Please, I'm a professor here and it's very important.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I've spoken with the judge and he's agreed to release you under my supervision.
If I agree to this, I walk right now?
I told you to cooperate with these people.
Then don't set up any more meetings.
Will.
Thank you.
I know. We just couldn't wait 'till Monday to find out.
Good to see you.
I've been busy, Gerry. I got a full schedule.
Where he contracted pneumonia and died at a young age--
Gerry! Any trouble finding the place?
Seems like it's going well.
Well, have you talked to him at all about his future?
Jobs doing what?
You see, Sean? That's exactly not the point. No one remembers that. They--
Look, you took one road and I took another. That's fine.
--And here I am for the second week in a row with my professional reputation at stake--
--Ready to falsify documents because you've given him license to walk away from this.
He has a gift and with that gift comes responsibility. And you don't understand that he's at a fragile point--
Oh, come on, Sean--
Oh, that's nice--
--Is that what this is about, Sean? The Field's Medal? Do you want me to go home and get it for you? Then will you let the boy--
Why there?
Do you know when you'll be back?
Who is he?
What should I do?
What happened?  You got fired, huh?
There goes that fuckin' Barney right now, with his fuckin' "skiin' trip." We should'a kicked that dude's ass.
You're right. I know.
No, but, I mean you know...I do other things. That no one knows about.
Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but I'm married and I have two children.
Who is "Danny Terrio?"
Well, I can see this is pointless...
Probably not.
You people baffle me. You spend all this money on beautiful, fancy books-- and they're the wrong fuckin' books.
Free weights. WILL Oh yeah? Me too. What do you bench?
Tell me what you really think.
What does?
What is?
Oh, "Starry Night" time, huh?
So what's with this place? You have a swan fetish? Is this something you'd like to talk about?
Really? How'd the date go? WILL Do you still counsel veterans?  I read your book last night.
What happened to that guy from Kentucky?
Do you ever wonder what your life would be like if you never met your wife?
I just slid my ticket across the table and said "sorry fellas, I gotta go see about a girl."
They could see that I meant it.
It's not about that job. I'm not saying you should work for the government. But, you could do anything you want. And there are people who work their whole lives layin' brick so their kids have a chance at the kind of opportunity you have. What do you want to do?
Nobody gets what they ask for, Will. That's a cop-out.
I know.
Don't fuck with me.
That's what you want?
I just want you to know, Sean...
I'll keep in touch.
You suck.
I've been sitting over there for forty- five minutes waiting for you to come talk to me. But I'm just tired now and I have to go home and I wasn't going to keep sitting there waiting for you.
Skylar. And by the way. That guy over there is a real dick and I just wanted you to know he didn't come with us.
When you think about it, it's just as arbitrary as drinking coffee.
Five minutes.
Oh Will! I was wondering when you'd call.
Stanford. I'm leaving in June after I graduate.
No I haven't...
Oh, you will?
How was that?
I swear to God.
It was great. There was always someone to play with, give you advice.
Where have you been?
Didn't your mother ever tell you not to look a gift horse n the mouth?
You're not going into surgery tomorrow are you?
I've never seen your place.
You men are shameful. If you're not thinking of your weiner then you're acting on its behalf.
Nobody does organic chemistry for "fun." It's unnecessary. Especially for someone like you.
Well all right, Beethoven. He looked at a piano and saw music. The fuckin' guy was deaf when he composed the Ode to Joy. They had to turn him around to take a bow because he couldn't hear the crowd going crazy behind him. Stone deaf. He saw all of that music in his head.
Not a lick. I look at a piano and I see black and white keys, three pedals and a box of wood. Beethoven, Mozart, they looked at it and it just made sense to them. They saw a piano and they could play. I couldn't paint you a picture, I probably can't hit the ball out of Fenway Park and I can't play the piano--
Will? Are you awake?
Come with me to California.
Why not?
Look, Will if you're not in love with me, you can say that.
Yes I do. Did you ever think that maybe I could help you? That maybe that's the point, that we're a team?
You doin' the hirin'?
All right, mister. I'll go. You just show your license to contrack, an' then you make out a order--where an' when an' how much you gonna pay--an' you sign it an' we'll go.
She'll prob'ly ride like a bull calf-- but she'll ride!
*Some*body got to take the blame. They just *got* to hang it on somebody, you know.  An' I ain't doin' nothin' but set around.
Ready, Ma?
Maybe. Maybe twenny days work, maybe *no* days work. We ain't got it till we get it.
Woman can change better'n a man. Man lives in jerks--baby born, or somebody dies, that's a jerk--gets a farm, or loses one, an' that's a jerk. With a woman it's all one flow, like a stream, little eddies, little waterfalls, but the river it goes right on. Woman looks at it like that.
Why, I ain't hardly touchin' you!
Tom? You can come on. They gone.
Any gas?
Kinda pie y'got?
Want to work?
Can all of you work?
We got five sanitary units. Each one elects a central committee man. They make the laws, an' what they say goes.
No cop can come in here without a warrant.
*You* find out, I can't.
No, I never. What?
Ain't you seen your folks since then?
Lissen. This wind's fixin't to *do* somepin'!
Well, if it ain't Tom Joad. How ya, boy?
I guess that's right. Have to take a beatin' before he'll know.
Seems like we wasn't never gonna do nothin' but move. I'm so tar'd.
Yeah.
You people got a lotta nerve.
An' the nex' thing you know you'll be out, because they got it all figgered down to a T--until the harvest is in you're a *migrant* worker--afterwards, just a bum.
Now listen, Grampa. Listen to me, just a minute.
How 'bout Granma?
Ma. Pa.  Grampa, his eyes hurt and hunted and frightened and bewildered, scratches in the dirt.
*Ain't* a-goin'... ain't a-goin'...
Where you going?
Okay. Go ahead, but you better keep movin'.
I know, but I got a stomickache. I ain't hungry.
Wouldn't be no use. I'd still see 'em inside the tent.
But will it--hurt the baby?
I like the tent better.
Anybody ask anything?
Ma... you know, if Connie was here I wouldn't min' any a this.
You don't know *no* girls around here. You're lyin', *You're runnin' away*!
Jus' sassy, that's all.
Pa! Shh!
Make her easy, John. Watch her.
Maybe, but we shore takin' a beatin'.
Mad, Ma?
Forget it, Ma. I got her figgered out. Long as I keep outa trouble, ain't nobody gonna say a thing. All I gotta do is keep my nose clean.
Look, Ma!
When?
She shore don't look prosperous. Want to go somewheres else?
I'm a-tryin', Ma. Honest I am.
Folks ain't talkin' about much else. They say they got posses out. Talkin' about a lynchin'--when they catch the fella.
No, Ma. Not that. That ain't it. But long as I'm a outlaw, anyways, maybe I can do sump'n. Maybe I can jus' fin' out sump'n. Jus' scrounge aroun' an' try to fin' out what it is that's wrong, an then see if they ain't sump'n could be done about it.  But I ain't thought it out clear, Ma. I can't. I don't know enough.
Sure. Good-by.
Yeah?
Which ones?
They gone.
Some say I am.  You want to hear what happened?
Well?
That's Connie Rivers with her. They're married now.  She's due about three-four months.
How you get all this money?
Got that desert yet. Gotta take her tonight. Take her in the daytime fella says she'll cut your gizzard out.
But what does *that* prove?
Tom says if it's day it'll cut you gizzard smack out a you.  I seen a pitcher once. They was bones ever'place.
Yes, sir.
Oh... really?
What do you do?
You do not.
Bob. Bob Destephano.
I'm Dan. Dan Koretzky.
Never better.
I'd come to the realization that everything I'd based my life on was false. And that my life had no meaning.
Jesus...
And these pan pizzas have opened up the doors to heaven?
How long has it been?
That's part of it.
You met people.
Watched television?
I figured I could pick you up tomorrow around seven o'clock.
Seven it is.
You're fucking psycho.
Soft. I'll take the junkie otter, clearly! I'd let the little beast scratch and claw all he wants... Okay. Would you rather make love to the candied corpse of Phyllis Diller--
Then I started losing my taste for it. Which usually means your time is up. But then I realized it was something entirely different... I started getting the sneaking, dark suspicion that maybe there was... meaning to life.
I was leaving.
Will you come with me?
What if I come back?
You don't get to have me. You are a monster, I'm a human being. We're not going to mate.
How do you know?
Yes.
If I show up at your door, chances are you did something to bring me there. I don't care about that stuff, anyway.
That's it then. That's it. I've always been alone. That's why I'm a good driver. I can handle it. See, I can think on my feet. I survive, I'm a thinker. And I can sit there in front of your house for two hours and it don't bother me. Some people can't do it! Some people are ranting and raving, "Tell them fuckin' people to get out here and get in this car, I can't-- I want a go!" Where you gonna go? You're gonna wind up back in your garage at seven o'clock at night. You ain't going nowhere. You leave your house in the morning you get back to your house in the evening. What's the big deal, right?
Thank you, no.
Come on, live a little. I'm sorry about the incident yesterday.
It's okay. It's Martin The door begins to open revealing Debi and Newberry.
I'm an attorney. I'm with Moss, Brice & Fromeyer.
Sometimes. I'm in divorce, mainly. Some property. Some personal injury.
Wait a minute--
Looks like someone keeps trying to do our job for us.
...Tell them that's not my problem. I was paid for one job-- the cyclist-- not two. See you tomorrow, Marcella.
They're not happy, sir.
They were very upset.
And sir, I also get that broken- mirror, black-cat, Friday-the- thirteenth kind of feeling about this one....
Enough?
Don't forget your identity.
This is not good.
I have to call the client and give them a reason why you're late.
I'll call them and tell them you're taking your time. Being a professional.
I imagine that'd be rather difficult.
God it's great to see you.
Debi's house.
So it's not a meaningful symbol, or anything. That badge is just the badge of your company. If I look suspicious on your customers' property-- well, under those heightened circumstances you have the authority to, ah... To shoot me.
Why not?
It's, uh... beautiful country. I had a little bit of a hard time finding the place. There are no signs.
I uh... ha, ha... I don't think I ever met a lady quite like yourself and I appreciate all the pains you've gone through to --
You lived in Chicago?
I've decided it's impossible to properly say hello in this place without a hat.
I found this old cello case filled with bills and receipts.
I thought you lived in Chicago?
Are you shy, Mr. Booker?
Enjoy the day.
Shit.
Poor thing.
Is this how you're going to make me pay my phone bill?
Actually, I never rode Western. I'm sorry. Go ahead.
Son?
Ever think of moving there full time?
Yeah, I think it is. And I don't mean everybody's got to be married, have kids -- It's more like, knowing where you're from, where you belong, what feeds you, where you can go no matter what happens... Knowing what you're supposed to be doing while you're here.
This is Mr. Booker, Robert.
I figured, whenever you decided to go, you'd be all set.
Liz is taking care of him.  The doctor said the sooner you start therapy the better the chances are you can --
Why don't you go lie down?
Grace, listen to me. Your body is just healing. You have to give the rest of you time as well...
No, you didn't.
Yeah?
No, I don't mean you have to. It's just that we may not have enough --
That's not true! Whatever problems your father and I are having, have nothing to do with this.
Did he tell you that?
Nothing.
I was just trying to say thank you to Diane and Frank and --
When? Tonight?
Who's ever going to want me? Nobody will.
Why should they?
How's everything?
Everyone. Working overtime. Just for you.
Yes. We're suing.
Oh, come on! This is such bullshit! The work is getting done, David. Lucky keeps me on top of everything.
Okay. You want me to pick you up?
Oh, uh, I meant to tell you... Alex brought that fabric over...
... And uh... Mario called about moving the wisteria?
Aw... that's so sweet.
You've got to stop doing that?
Did you get a hold of that horse guy?
That's the craziest thing I ever heard. Absolutely not.
NO! What are you -- you're serious about this?
You've already made arrangements!?
Her psychiatrist... said... she needs security now... stability...
What if she doesn't want to go?
Yeah. She seems to be getting more comfortable on the ranch, which is why I said yes to this move. But, whenever it's just the two of us, I don't know... Anyway... what's happening with the Delco lawsuit?
So, how are you doing in Marlboro country? Is the magazine complaining at all?
When are you coming home?
Huh-huh. You?
How are you feeling about work?
Yes?
Was the trip okay?
I have so much to tell you.
Well, did you ever think about hiring a business manager?
I'll have another round of that spaghetti if may?
But, uh, Egypt is, well, it's like nothing else. It's like going back in time.  I remember as a kid trying to imagine what a kid my age, centuries ago, walking over that same ground, was wondering about or, if they had the same problems as me... and I felt, connected to... to time itself, almost. Ha, I never realized how hard it was to describe.
You and Frank ever take a vacation?
Must be nice for you to take a few days off from your work, huh?
You don't seem to upset?
Did you always know this was the life you wanted?
Annie, it's Liz. How's Grace?
- See, what you can do for him --...
Maybe we should give him another sedative.
Ha...
Teacher asked me why we raise Black Angus-Herefords 'stead of Pure Herefords.
They don't get burned by the sun bouncing off the snow. And they're good mother.
Don't you go to school?
You wouldn't want to dance with me, would you?
Are you afraid of anything?
Sure?
My parents are having friends from college over. They're really nice... They have this gorgeous son who wants to be a forest ranger.
"... and I said that"...
Have you heard from Judith's parents?
Do you want something else, honey? We order something else?
Don't be such a baby!
Is the poverty worse, now, you think?
You know, Rona, we weren't all that good together even when we were good together.
Well, that'll happen.
You think it's cool?
How's it going, Ray?
Good. Good man. Alright, let's finish up here, and take him in for interrogation.
That's it! An electronic army! If I were us, I'd get on the internet, send out a major distress signal.
Maybe. But, if I were gonna hack some heavy metal, I'd, uh, work my way back through some low security, and try the back door.
So what do you think, can I crash at your place tonight?
Shit!
I can't. Everybody who touches that thing gets busted, I can't afford to get arrested, I'm sorry.
Active matrix, man. A million psychedelic colors. Man, baby, sweet, ooo!
Snoop onto them...
Yeah?
Yo. Check this out guys, this is insanely great, it's got a 28.8 BPS modem!
I'm fine.  Oh, and Dade, try to stay out of trouble, okay?
Yo, showtime, showtime!
Look out, man. Lisa Blair, 26 East 7th St., apartment 16, 555-4817, BOOM!
Seven. Wow! Burn's wetware matches her software!
Here's your class.
That's a nice score for a girl.
He's not in this class.
Burn. You're Acid Burn. You booted me out of OTV!
Thank you.
Well that's great. There goes MIT.
Ready?
Oh, wow, she's great.
Uhhh.. ahahaha...
Gill.
However, we have come to believe that one Joey Pardella is involved in this Ellingson virus. He or perhaps his accomplice has a disk that Mr. Belford needs to disable that virus. We want you to help us find it.
Hello?
A rabbit replicates till it overloads a file, then it spreads like cancer.
What? whatwhatwhat?
Joey, a garbage file holds miscellaneous data. Junk. Bits of stuff that's been erased, man.
What is he doing in here?
Yesterday, the ballast program for a supertanker training model mistakenly thought the vessel was empty, and flooded its tanks.
But you've created a virus that's going to cause a worldwide ecological disaster, just to arrest some hacker kid?
Murphy kid turn you down?
From here I got access to every piece of data ever stored on Dade Murphy's parents. His parents separated five years ago, reconciled two years later, filed for divorce last year, custody battle, boy chose to go with his mother. Hmm.
What is it? What's wrong?
So?
Well you found out this morning? Why didn't you tell me before? I mean it's 5 o'clock now Rachel...shit
So?
I am different, it's just that I just got pissed off...that's all.
Is there another key?
Brady!
An accident?
Can't you find somebody else?
Because the lights are all out.
We should call the fire department.
Why shouldn't I?
Yes.
Jamie, sometimes it's...
What?
Rachel, can I go get my costume on?
I thought you said you were ready.
Jamie, wait for me.
Can we go home soon Rachel?
Rachel, take your sister upstairs. First door on the right.
Why don't you go make some coffee.
You remember Lindsay don't you?
You know Rach, Discount Mart is having a sale on Halloween costumes.
Well do I drop you off at the Discount Mart or the Dairy Queen?
Call me.
Hell of a night.
Making sure that no one can get in here.
I'll be out on gateway and I doubt I'll be back before the troopers get here.
I am. Ben Meeker.
That's impossible. Michael Myers is an invalid.
You son of a bitch, you just created a lynch mob.
Where's that Deputy?
Okay.
Shit!
He was standing right here.
You still spooked?
Mister Riddle was watching you? Laurie, Mister Riddle is eighty-seven.
I always said you'd make a fabulous girl scout.
Well, I just talked with Ben Tramer and he got real excited when I told him how attracted you were to him.
You'll have to. He's calling you tomorrow to find out what time to pick you up.
Get him out of here!
I don't want to.
You idiot!
My parents won't be back till ten.
I gotta go.
I'd like to talk to you, if I could.
Anybody live here?
A man wouldn't do that...
I keep thinking I should call the radio and TV stations...
You have the wrong feeling.
It's totally insane! We have three new cheers to learn in the morning, the game in the afternoon, I get my hair done at five, and the dance is at eight. I'll be totally wiped out!
Well, she's totally not here.
Okay. Later.
Hey, Laurie...
Are you coming over tonight?
What about the bogyman?
How?
Everybody has a good time tonight. Okay, kids, what do you want to do now?
Sam, Haddonfield is a hundred and fifty miles from here. How could he get there? He can't drive.
If you say so.
Ever done anything like this before?
I couldn't if I tried.
Hm-mm.  Oh, yeah.  I met Phil.
We need more bread and some baked lasa--  uh, lasagne.  Hi.
Hi.
You know, April, people pass by vital structures in this city all the time, and they never take the time to appreciate them.  I get the feeling you tune in to your environment.
Oh, yeah.
Oh!
It's French, though.  It really is.
Well, wait.  You know what?  I know.
And you, you-you're going?
Hmm?
I can't resist.
Listen, you guys are too attractive to be caterers.  Something's wrong.
Yeah.
Oh, gee, I don't know.  Um...
Y-you live in Chelsea, don't you?
Have you been exposed to a loud noise recently, or did you have a virus?
I always, I-I always imagine that I have things.
What I'd like to do, is to make an appointment for you at the hospital. I'd like to have them run some tests.
Child molestation is a touchy subject...
Oh, you know, I, I love that book you lent me.  The Easter Parade? You were right.  It had very special meaning for me.
Really?  So, so, what else?  Wh- what are you up to?
Hi.
Well, I'm-I'm looking for a bookstore.
Well, listen, you didn't know me before Frederick.  I'd...I'd start with a beer at about ten in the morning, and...go on.
I think to myself  what problems could she possibly have?
Yes? LEE  A couple of blocks from here.  If you don't know about it, you should. You'd really love it.
Yeah.  How are you?
e.e. cummings.  I'd like to get you this.
Did you ever get around to the poem on page a hundred and twelve?
Wh--, it-it-it-it, it's so sad. She's crazy about me, but somewhere on the, along the line, I've fallen out of love with her.
That was just perfect.  You've ruined me for anyone else.
I was so worried I wouldn't compare with Hannah.
She has all the cooking talent.
God, Mickey's such a hypochondriac. I wonder how he'd handle it if there was ever anything really wrong with him?
Why not?
No!
Hi.  How's she doing?
So?
Who thinks about such nonsense? Now I'm alive.  When I'm dead, I'll be dead.
How about something to eat?
Isn't it enough that I can love you?
Lucy and I kept talking, and I didn't realize how late it had gotten.
Oh!  Are we going to have this conversation again?
Why?
N-n-no, not that.
Mickey, come on, we got a show to do!
Well, he has to rule out certain things. 
Eh, you were miserable this morning! We got bad reviews, terrible ratings, the sponsors are furious...
Do you realize what a thread we're all hanging by?
Yes, please.
Tch, well, you know, eventually it, it is going to happen to all of us.
...you know it, it just takes the pleasure out of everything.  I mean, you're gonna die, I'm gonna die, the audience is gonna die, the network's gonna-- The sponsor. Everything!
Oh, great.
Hi.  Where's Holly?
So how are you?
I can't believe Elliot and I can't think of someone nice for you to go out with, you know--
Yeah.  I-I don't know what's wrong with him.  He's just...kind of distant and difficult.
I mean, I don't know, he's seeing someone else or something, but...
Yeah, aren't you like, you know...
How could I ruin myself?  What do you mean, ruin myself?
What are you talking about?
Hey!
You promised to stay on the wagon.
I just had a lot of luck...from my first show, you know?  I've always thought Lee was the one destined for great things.
Hannah, I have to borrow some more money.  Don't get upset.
Well, in order to get started, there's just a few things I have to buy...  and some old debts I have outstanding.
Okay.
Maybe when she's eighty, she'll stop straightening her garter belt when there's a guy around.
Frederick didn't come with her.
Oh, Hannah!
He's such a loser!
You know, I just want to look so good, but I don't want to seem, you know, like I'm overdressed.  You know what I'm saying? HANNAH  Oh, no, not at all.
You found all this, all this out on one date?
...every, eh, single rejection as- as-as a...a confirmation that you have no talent, or something?
Boy, I knew you'd be discouraging.
You treat me like a loser.
I'm-I'm always happy to help you financially.  I think I've gone out of my way to-to introduce you to interesting single men.  There's nothing I would--
You're too demanding.
Good.
Can we, can we go?
Oh, well, I cannot communicate with you!  I, you know, I never realized you were such a tightass. MICKEY I can't understand you.  Your sisters, both sisters have such good taste in music.  I don't know where you went, went wrong.
I was so bored!
Oh, look, I'm sorry it didn't work out.
Mmm, I don't know if you remember me, but we had the worst night of my life together.
I'd never do that.
Oh, well, that was a long time ago.
People change...you know.
Yeah, I hope you have, too. MICKEY  I hope so for your sake, because, uh, your personality left something to be desired...
You're kidding me.
Well, what about me?
No, you can tell me straight.  It's okay.  Just, you know, tell me what you think.
Oh, it just came to me one day.
That I've always regretted the way I behaved that evening we went out, and, uh...I've, I just thought I'd tell you that because I really made a fool out of myself.
Do you?  I mean, are you, are you, are you, are you free this evening?
Now don't get nervous.  It's just your husband.
Oh, my God.  Thank you.
Yeah, Mom's Camille when she gets up in the morning.
Well, okay.  Thank you very much.
And?
You've gone off to America, on your <u>Vacation</u>...
Would you mind saying that into your bag...?
Well.  Word gets around.
What have they got you doing?
Why me?
Lechter's not buying up his Memorabilia. He keeps it all in his "mind," do you see...?
There's one or two freaks, and, for a "<u>Pass</u>," I'll rat them out to you... 
...aren't you afraid of me...?
And why is it a vacant exercise?
C'mon, pal.
Hard up as you are, at your age?  Whadda <u>you</u> care?  Surrender.
..who would benefit from his disappearance?  <u>No</u> one.  No one has but lost by it...
How was America?
...nightmare.
...are they hard to get?
Why did he come back?
<u>Do</u> it...
If you would see him monument, look around you.
What do you want me to do?
He don't like popcorn.
He is...?
You should get the kids a <u>dog</u>...
No, no, of course not.
And I expect you to.  Let's talk like two medical men 
...fraid, that's about it, Doctor.
I am all attention.
Just a moment.  Starling didn't...
I had... one moment, I had an <u>agent</u> in there, waiting for <u>backup</u> from...
Waited too long, hon...?  
Sadly, no.  And I find that birth is one of the few things in life which study and a pleasant attitude can not amend. What do you think?
And yet, they are not know for their cuisine.
No, this is <u>pleasure</u>...
Of course, Commendatore...
I never met him.  I knew him only from his writings.
I saw a man, somewhat <u>fatigued</u>. Quickly dressed, a bit dishevelled.  In the middle of the day.  An old story.  And then I saw the clothing was <u>fresh</u>--therefore:  a man who dressed at <u>home</u>.  And then I remarked the new <u>wedding</u> ring.  And so:  the <u>story</u> gave me pause.  A lovely story.  A new, and a beloved <u>wife</u>.  I wish you joy. 
And?  Then?
How could you know?
Who does not?
I've left my <u>program</u>...
Do you like it at your home, Franklin?
Well, I don't want to starve them too long.  They die.
I came to pay my...
I'm going to cut you loose.  With all due respect, Doctor, if you fuck with me, I'll shoot you dead, do you understand...?  Do right and you'll live through this.
I hope you'll <u>find</u> it so.  Yes.  It's <u>good</u> to see you regaining your strength...
...I'm sorry....?
Indeed we were.
Freud, do you know...?  Freud psychoanalyzed patients in One Afternoon.
Thank you, Cordell.
ARE YOU <u>DONE</u>?
...when I... 
I guess the only thing is Suck it Up...
Our Mister <u>Frendler</u> to, to, to humiliate me, though....
Look what they put her on...
I'm going to do it, and you're going to catch the bouquet.
No.  I want to buy a dog. 
What was it.  What was it, honey?
Yeah.  Well.  They're a talkative buncha commentators.
Trouble is, they all seem to <u>die</u>.
Don't shoot yourself.
...whatever is within my <u>power</u>...
I know something no one knows.  He has had his finger removed.  On his left hand.  It left a scar. 
<u>Do</u> you.  What does that mean?
Waal, you hold fast to that thought, as I'm sure, that's a "clue"...
...<u>barter</u> with her.  To appeal to her, and you feel that...
Yes.
And you have decided to accept... to accept this "emotion," as you put it, to the ... the "sweepings. of the Lechter case.
And.  I always said, he was a <u>P'lice</u> officer.
But.  He was a night <u>watchman</u>.  That's what he was.  N'They brought back, his hat, his <u>badge</u>, an his <u>timeclock</u>.  N'then they took me off.  I <u>saw</u>... I saw.  Clear as day, do you, do they call it a <u>delusion</u>?  His hat an his badge.  Clear as day, bulletholes and all.
For the <u>worst</u> hurt, of course, that which will not heal, is the conviction no one cares.
Because, sir, you are the only one of his victims who lived.  And because you have large resources.
...sir...?
Yes, then, you're saying that you <u>haven't</u> bid upon these drawings.
You think you're so...but you're just...
Okay, okay, just don't everyone talk at once...First of all, little Jason has a learning disability...
Yowza--Only a virgin could answer that fast.
I couldn't tell her...it's, it's too major...Jesus, I'm starting to believe in God and what's worse I think I like the guy. The lightning bolt was just a test, right?  Wendy and I--we're meant to be. I'm right, right?  I have to see her...
Thanks, Talia...Why are you so nice to me?
No, they're not from Wendy.

Don't forget, when you get home, O.B.'s. They're created by a female gynecologist.
What are you doing?
You know you just do this for shock value. It's not shocking.
I'm sorry. It just...It seems silly. Like kissing a girl.
"...how important our friendship..." Not that old--Oh God, what have I done?
Oh you know, Bosnia, the importance of the right to vote...
We have more in common than you think, Wendy dear. I loved summer camp when I was young and I love it now. It's important. Between school, family, friends, pot, playstations, basic cable, and the goddamn Internet, it's possible to go your whole life without listening to your soul. Out here, in nature, away from the shit, surrounded by reminders of who I once was...I get recharged. Now who's the dork?
Do you really not believe in God?
So this is it, anybody you don't agree about everything with can't be your friend...
I know what you mean. But it doesn't put me in too great a position...

I don't know. This thing leaves a bad taste in my mouth.
You don't have anything <u>for</u> her either. Come on, it'll be Very. The note'll give her shower nozzle masturbation material for weeks.
Just imagine somebody like your quasi-fat, goody-good friend Betty Finn doing a Crest commercial. No one would buy Crest.
You stupid cunt!
Grow up, Heather. Bulimia's so '86.
Anyway, I can say never to high school. I've got David.
Yeah, you know Holden Caulfield in the Catcher in the Rye wouldn't put up with their bogus nonsense.
I said I was sorry.
Veronica! Color me stoked, girl. I've gotten <u>everyone</u> to sign this petition even the one who think BigFun are tuneless Eurofags. People love me!  My God, you haven't signed!
God Veronica, drool much? His name's Jason Dean. He's in my American History.
What were <u>you</u> trying to do? Sleep?
You're giving your life away to become a goddamn statistic in U.S. Fucking A Today. That's got to be the least private thing I can think of.
Let's knock off early. Go to the mall. Something lame like that.
Probably just row on out to the middle of a lake. Bring along my sax, some tequila, and some Bach.
You going to pull a Big Gulp with that?
I've been moved around all my life; Dallas, Baton Rouge, Vegas, Sherwood Ohio, there's always a 7-11. Any town, any time, I can pop a Ham and Cheese in the microwave and feast on a Big Wheel. Keeps me sane.
The extreme always makes an impression, but you're right, it was severe. Did you say a Cherry or Coke Slurpee?
It's not perfect. I don't really like my friends.
Trust me. She skips the Saturday morning trip to Grandma's even when she's not hungover.
O-kay. We'll cook up some soup and put it in a Coke. Sick, eh? Now should it be Chicken-Noodle or Bean-with-Bacon?
Milk and orange juice. Hmmmm. Maybe we could cough a phlegm globber in it or something.
No luck? Well, milk and orange juice'll do quite nicely. Quite nicely.
We did a murder. In Ohio, that's a crime. But if this was like a suicide thing.....
"You might think what I've done is shocking..."
Heather Chandler is more popular than ever now.
We don't want to make them out to be too secretly eloquent. Why would the Germans invent a bullet that doesn't kill people? I mean it <u>was</u> World War Two, not a school play.
Did to.
Can't you see this is a special moment?
You can be so immature!
Catch a movie? Miniature Golf?
It's over, J.D.  Over!
You're still not listening! I'm not..
This knife is filthy.
Okay, okay. I knew that. I knew that. Put your hands on your head.
How do you turn the fucker off?
The bomb, asshole!
Terrible thing. So will we get to meet this dark horse prom contender?
We have to talk.  Whether to kill yourself is one of the most important decisions a teenager has to make.
I got a confession to make. My name used to be Heather, too.
The world wants winners, I guess. Not people stained with loserness.
Mummy has a special technique called "Deep Therapy."
I've never cottoned on to Plasticine like you girls, but I enjoy making things out of wood.
I'll think you'll find our Mr. Bayliss is not keen on seafood. I've got lamb chops in the 'frigerator.
Come on! Sausage rolls.
Yvonne hasn't been herself, either. Locking herself away in her room . . . endlessly writing.
No arguments there, Dr. Hulme! All that time inside working on those novels of theirs. They don't get fresh air or exercise!
wanders out. HONORA turns to Pauline and Juliet.
 Got an A, Mum!
My name is Gina!
Who cares!
snatches up an exercise book from a large pile.
I've heard your mother on 3YA. The Woman's Session has lots of lively debate.
I wouldn't want my private business being discussed with a complete stranger!
That's coming along well!
I'm saving them for a rainy day.
looks startled at the outburst.
Hello!
0h, God . . . I'm so sorry!
I wish James would do a religious picture . . . he'd be perfect as Jesus!
James will be there . . . and Mario! Only they'll be saints.
This.
I thought he was supposed to be terribly ill.
Poor Father . . .
Mummy!
It's a three-act story with a tragic end.
Isn't it beautiful!
What just happened to me anyway? It looked like a dream but it felt like reality.
What's happening to me? What are you doing?
You're one tough cookie, Trevor Gooding. You keep coming back to your corner for a quick fix up then go right back out into the ring for another round.
So, I'm done. Thats it for today?
Hint. It's not a geographical location.
Lucky for us these chairs happened to be here.
No.
Sorry.
Since what?
So you're just packing it up just like that?
Who's Allison?
What did you just say?
No. No you said HER BODY's been missing.
You could say that.
Come on speak up, Gooding, I'm trying to run a business here. I can't have people flipping out in the break room when they should be slaving away at their desks.
YOU'RE giving ME a speeding ticket? Mr. Mario Andretti himself?
You win! Okay pull over.
OH MY GOD TREVOR! It hurts!!  oh my God, Oh my God. Trevor, It's coming out.
But you had more wisdom than to listen to a false prophet
And besides, I thought, to hell with it... it's okay if you only married me for my money.
Happy Anniversary, Mrs. Gooding.
Trevor I've decided we have got to agree on a name before we reach my mother's. This poor kid's going to be starting preschool as student x if we don't make up our minds. So, I've been thinking, what about Daisy?
Thanks for coming down Mr. Gooding. Has your head healed okay by now?
You and your wife were playing a game shortly before you got into that car accident weren't you?
Look Larry I know you never thought too much of me. And I know this all sounds a little fucked up.
How is our little student doing? Has he learned his lesson yet?
But that's what I need. To be sure... to be absolutely sure...
Looks like you live in here, for Chrissake!
I never really thought they'd go for it.  And then... you didn't come forward, they investigated my war record...  I kept expecting you to show up and expose me...
You should go in.  You're risking your life again...
You got it?  Four year scholarship to a top college, plus Medical School or Law School or whatever Joey wants; pay off the $2,500 to my attorney, plus pay her fee in full, plus my annual consulting fee...
You'll tell him I talked you out of jumping, right?  Just keep me outta prison.
I know what he means.  I'm not a prison kinda guy, Miss O'Day.  I'm a goddamn working man for Chrissake!  Maybe I "augment" my income a little with some "business deals," maybe summa the guys I sell to are crooks, how would I know, I'm not an investigator.  You can't make it on a wage no more, not in this country.
A son, yeah.  What about him?  Joey.
Often, uh.
"The Angel of Flight 104!"  You're telling me you're the A...?
What is it, five days now I don't see you!
Nope.  Legal problems, you gotta have a good attorney.
I didn't even know you had a kid.
You in business with those guys or what?  I wouldn't want a problem for the establishment, Bern.
"Elliot"?  The heroic goddamn fireman?
You!
How do ya think I got it, for Chrissake?  Hey, put that thing down.  This is my goddamn apartment, you can't just...
For God's sake, tell him I'm on my way.  Let's go, Chucky.  A police escort is gonna pick us up en route.  You too, LaPlante.
If you're not in the car in ten seconds, I'll have the cops pick you up.
My fault!  My fault!  This nut case goes out on a ledge and it's my fault?
Listen, Mister LaPlante... uh, Bernie... Who... are... you?
Here.  Get off here.
Well, I'm not entitled to a million dollars.  I... I... didn't expect... I didn't expect...
I know the truth, John.  I'm flying in some guys from your unit in Vietnam tomorrow.  Interviewing them live on network hookup!
There, like that.  Kind of, uh, sexy.  You can support me anytime, John.
Swiped your purse!  While he was saving you?  You gotta be kidding!
She broke up with her boyfriend.  Listen, babe, we needja back. You gotta follow up on the jumper, find the human interest in the grim, unending tale of woe that pours from the wounded heart of the heartless metropolis.
That too.
He's right.  It's unprofessional.
Upset!  What's he upset about?
Helluva story!
I haven't won it yet.  I notice you've got me scheduled on a flight back an hour after the ceremony.
Hey, Miss Gayley, there's a cop looking for you.  From Robbery Detail, Inspector Dayton.  He wants you to call him.
I didn't ask him.
Inspector Dayton, the cop from Robbery Detail who was looking for you.  They caught the guy who stole your credit cards trying to sell them and he wants...
Safety?
So, <u>Neil</u>.  How's it goin'?
Wife, girlfriend or mother?
And what about work?  Have you had any more thoughts about what you'd like to be doing now?
The whole disapproval thing.  If you allow yourself to get into a situation where someone else's potential disapproval becomes the focal point of your life -- then you're back to a life of fear, aren't you?  -- You're a prisoner to that again, and that isn't much of a life.
Oh no -- I mean, she's genuinely made me more fulfilled in many ways -- and I hope eventually to be able to teach her a few things, too.  What I mean is, I guess I'm still waiting for just that right -- synthesis between us -- where everything will be understood between us without even the need for words.
Yeah, maybe you're right. Everything else is just an excuse. I'm treating the situation with kid gloves because I'm afraid of losing her.
Well, can I make an appointment?
I bet.  Going into people's homes.
It's nice that you can make that choice.
What happened?
Hey.  Have a nice time -- it's a good school.
Your daddy and I are kind of mad at each other right now, so we have to spend some time apart.
So you don't have anything concrete?
Rita, he's only twelve years old,
He doesn't have a temperature.
Whew.
Where'd he go?
Honey --
Honey, do you want some hot chocolate?
I know it's at the high end of our range --
But it's what we want.
He made, you know, a remark.
I hear things in this house,
Neil's still having a bad time at school.  I feel terrible seeing him so upset all the time.
I mean, he's a smart kid, he'll get by -- he takes after me. You're too sensitive.
Yeah, I guess it would be good for us to get away for a while.  Maybe Rudolf got the same idea.  Dogs need a change of scene, too, from time to time.
Sweetheart, this is a very risky time for me right now.  Maybe you don't appreciate that.
The floor has a nice shine to it.  Oh God -- we have twenty-two messages on the machine.
Who was that?
Because it caught my eye when it was in a higher price bracket in the listings.
Just reduced.
God, your sister's really hot.
Let's follow 'em.
It's fun.
All right then, if I have to go to school then I'd better go.
You knew a second ago.  <u>Who</u> started it?
Do you see a man?
Promise?
Really?
Where's the guy we saw in the beginning -- what's his name...?
What do you think?
Why are people walking around New York with swords, dressed in mid evil clothing?
Anything from the bank?
Where have you been for the last seven years?
Seven years ago I interviewed a guy. He said he saw two men fighting in an alley with swords.  One cut off the others head.  He shot the surviving guy twenty times and he got right back up and stabbed him.
You'll have no need for that, Highlander.
I know that weapon.  It belonged to Juan Romeriz.  He's dead?
You?
Thomas Cavenaugh.  I am a teacher of sorts.  Like Romeriz I help those newly acquainted with our life.
The river.
As friends -- always as friends.
Not long.  We should arrive in the morning.  Are you going to be alright?
Well?
I stood up first.
It will be a good harvest this year.
I think my Sarah fancies you, Conner.
Agreed.
Aye?
Electro magnetic soundings indicate we've only got a few inches of rock left before we reach the main chamber.
My name is Jennifer Hillman.  I was at the police station earlier today--
To talk to you.
What's going on?  Why did he call you Macleod?
You talk to me -- but you don't answer my questions.  I guess I'll have to talk to Lieutenant Bedsoe.
Good evening.
You have an interesting accent. Where are you from?
How come you wanted to meet tonight?
How could that be?  People don't live for three hundred years.
On the back it has--
Just a little.  Who knows what we're going to find in there.  It could be a huge excavation.  A little friendly PR never hurt.
It has to be.
Oh -- I almost forgot.  Your head.
Fine -- I've waited over three centuries.  I can wait a little longer.
You know it's not safe here for you.
You kept it?
Good afternoon, Mr. Parker.
Would you like to deposit this in your account?
Mike!  Mike, can you hear me?
Dead end--it's a clone.  What about the Mustang?
The house is in flames, Benza's accountant is with the cops, and they're stacking the bodies like cordwood.
I want a message sent:  No fuckups allowed.
Worst case, it's a bloodbath.  The detectives come out with Smith's computer, and we go directly to jail, do not pass Go.
Put our people on the scene.  Smith might talk just to cut a break for his kids.
Find out how we can hurt him.  By the end of the day, I want to own him.
Who sent you?
Stay down!  Stay <u>down</u>, goddamnit!
Bullshit!
<u>Shut up!  Shut up and get on the floor</u>!
That woman's gonna call the cops.
We could've gone out the back!  You didn't have to shoot!
The only way he can keep the cash is if nobody knows about it.  He's gotta cap all three of us before they even read our rights.  He's probably planning it right now.
Then we might as well die rich.
Yeah.  I'm Rooney.
Fuck you.  I'm running this shit.  You talk to me.
He needs a doctor.
All you're doing is watching yourself on TV.  <u>Look</u> at him.
L.A. County Sheriffs are inbound from a bank robbery in Pico Rivera.
If things get wet, we're going to need someone who can handle that end.
How did you get this number?
They're close.  Let me make a call.  You can see they're okay.
All right.  Now the second one.
Why don't you guys grab some dinner at the Thai place?  I'll meet you there as soon as I can.
Mommy won't know.  You can do anything you want right now.  Mommy won't know.
What?
Make the pizza.  I want scrambled eggs and hot dogs on mine.
What do you want?
We have to cordon off the streets, then evacuate these houses.
What's going on?
I'm Jeff Talley, the Bristo chief of police.  So far as we know, your children are okay.
Where are they?
She didn't answer.
Do it.
If you go in, you can't use tear gas or flashbangs.  The whole place would go up.
Excuse me?  <u>You</u> requested our help.  You turned over command --
I want to know what in hell you're doing.
I'm not stupid!  You can't get out of here fast enough, then you take back command; you agree to wait on Smith, then you risk everything in a stupid stunt to get him out --
The truck is registered to Dennis James Rooney, white male, twenty-two.  He has an Agua Dulce address.
Those kids are in there with a fucking psychopath!  He <u>kills</u> people!
This is Chief Talley.  Tell me your name, son.
That's on the second floor.  Could you climb out your window if we were downstairs to catch you?
He has lots of disks.
Are the disks still in your room?
Then you have everything.  You can put them away.
Where's your gun?
I can't control what happens.  The Sheriffs are running the scene.
When this phone rings, you answer.  It will be me.  I'll tell you what to do. When I have what I want, you get your family.
You dumb fuckwad cop, you fucked up <u>bad</u>!
We're almost home, you and me.  Keep your shit together.  This isn't L.A.
I used to work at the Diplomat.
They are all Tutsi cockroaches.
Here, here, a thousand US dollars - fifty thousand francs for my family. To let us drive off to the Mille Collines.
You will run into the hotel and hide behind the U.N.
Anything. Strong.
Congratulations, Colonel. You have saved us all.
The American assured the colonel that they would watch everything.
Yes, they can photograph the epaulets on your shoulder.
The Americans! Who are they to put us on trial. Let us imagine Paul when their president Kennedy was shot, they said it was a black man. Then their politicians, their radio stations gave orders 'we must wipe out these black people before they wipe out us.' What do you think would have happened? No different.
Where are they going?
You lie.
I will try my best George but these days I have no time for rallies or politics.
Beer yes, but no whiskey.
Let's go.
Satellite feed.
Holy shit! Holy shit.
The fifth room is your broadcast room.
The news room has heard that the French and the Belgians are putting together an intervention force.
Very soon.
There are no more rooms.
I am in charge now. Get back to work or I'll fire you.
Did you bring any of those wee girls who used to sit at the bar in the Diplomat with you? You know?
Everyone must leave the hotel now.
What do you want?
The commander is not here.
You have our cards.
It is dangerous to be here. The radio says this is a nest of cockroaches.
Everyone is dead there. The dogs eat the bodies in the street. I have to go.
I'm afraid you will have to move room.
I'm going to put you on the third floor.
They should go one truck at a time. When the first truck gets through to the airport, then the others will follow.
Let's have dinner first.
Why didn't you call your contacts in the army?
Send them home. We are not the police. What do we have to protect them?
Please, Paul, 'til first light.
Oh, my God!
What is it, Paul.
Them. They almost got us all killed. I have done enough for them! We cannot look after them anymore.
What!
Go to the roof now.
What's the matter?
I have to go out to get food.
It was substantial.
A car.
Ask them to wait a little longer. For the twins.
We have to have a plan.
The Diplomat! Tatiana wakens, startled.
Very well. But if this thing gets worse, we must close. If there's anything you need, call anytime.
Where has all our beer gone?
For food and clothes, and all that grows, etc, etc. Dear Lord, thank you.
I don't know.
Still alive, but it's just a matter of time. And then will come your miraculous resurrection --
"But you didn't, Ma'am. We have all these witnesses that saw..." well, whoever it ends up being that finally shoots him --
Why in God's name wasn't this thing removed years ago??
Just for the record: what are the rest of your names?
What?
Nice touch, Pritchett: subtle.
Put it this way: if it's your face on that tape, Mr. Moses, we're one gunshot away from solving all our problems --
Yeah, what the hell, I'll go.
What's in there?
So you're saying as long as that door stays locked, we're okay?
What's down there?
Pritchett!
What the hell good is fixing that gonna get us?
I think we should have taken a right back there.
Good point.
It's okay, everything's okay now.
No. It's just trying to frighten us.
Then what the hell are we doing here?
-- forget it. Last birthday the Manson Family Ranch, the year before that: Jonestown.
It you really loved me, Steven, you'd find a way to drop dead in the next three seconds.
Now, there's the simple country gal I married. Let's go back down and greet your guests -- show them the real you: corny as Kansas on the Fourth of July.
-- asking the wrong guy -- wasn't me who closed it.
What are you talking about?
And where are we off to, Mr. Price? Check the wiring on the animatronic Mummies?
I was in the middle of --
Ever seen one that starts at the top? 20 stories worth of top?
First time for everything.
-- it's getting older by the second. Mr. Price, if I could just please have --
House 2, Guests 0.
Vannacutt!!
He was right! Pritchett was right!
Don't test me, I'm real prepared to use this to stay alive --
-- listen to me, goddamnit --
Please! I need your help.
I mean, not that it didn't give Evelyn the kind of coronary I had in mind, just...
Rewind that.
It works.
Wish I could take the credit, but --
Oh, no.
Don't know that it does.
You should really open this place to the public, Pritchett -- a spa for people without enough stress in their lives.
There is something very not normal going on here!
Sara...?
So many unanswered questions.  Why was she buried there.  And who killed her?
They don't build them like this anymore.
It looks delicious...
Can we leave out a bowl of milk, mommy?
Can I do it again tonight?
What about all my other stuff?
H-how long will it take?
We're here Aubrey!  Look, don't be afraid.  We want you to come back to us...
Mommy please help me!
Good night Angel...
God rest her soul.
No.  Maybe it was Aubrey.
Weird sounds, things moving, lights going off.  The videotape...
Oh my God where is she!
You know, I was thinking... All that stuff father Seamus said...about discord, distrust... we're doing all right, aren't we?  You don't have any doubts about me, do you?
Nothing's changed, has it. You still want to deceive me?
You've done your homework, Mrs. South.
I'm hungry enough to eat a horse.
...at her request.  She was a very religious woman.
Well it's nice that you were there for her.
I'm going to need some blood.  It must be from a woman.
She's coming back.  Keep talking!
Did you have dinner, father?  We have plenty.
I said nothing before, for fear you wouldn't believe me.  I've been here before to cast evil from this house.  The amulet is a guard against evil, blessed in countless rituals.   It is an ancient ceremony of the early Catholic church, a ceremony whose secrets are all but lost.
We must return it, if you want your daughter back.
No.  But I'm a clairvoyant.  I can sometimes talk to unhappy spirits inhabiting a certain place.
I see some faint lettering.  It appears to be the...Runic alphabet?
There's something in there.
Hello?
Yeah.  Sure.  You mean ... tonight?
Oh.  You wanna talk about that stuff.
Wow.  Lotta books.  You read all these?
That had nothing to do with the world. Not this one, anyway.
Don't flee from yourself.  If you have a quality, let it define you.  Cultivate it.  It is you.  By helping me, you will help yourse...
How do we start?
JP?
Yeah right.  How'd you get this number?
A girl?  Anyone I should know?
Really?
Those dago-guinea-I can say this shit I'm Italian-wop motherfu--
This isn't funny.  I'm not into this.  I...
"You could be swinging on a star."
Did I miss anything?
Okay, you got me, Mr. PBS.
Shwoof, that makes me feel better. I can't believe this is the Iron Curtain.  All the guy at Airport customs wanted to know was "Who Shot J.R.?"
"Oh, we ain't got a barrel of money.
Now that's a lock.
"We all had our quarrels and parted..."
Welcome to Rome, sir.
Grapple, Biker's bottle, hairspray, black turtleneck, Pocket Fisherman, acid, collapsible yardstick, softball, and 72 stamps. Gee Stud, this is going to be some date.  No Harvey's Bristol Cream?
Lucky for us, the Da Vinci is located in a wing of the Kremlin that they used to throw the Miss Ukraine pageant and stuff.  It'll have the least number of guards....
Come on, Pierre, Steak-bur-ger, Fren-n-ch Fries.  This is France, you gotta have French.....
"Messed around" messed around?  I know-- I don't want to know.  First base?  Second Base?  Stop me when I'm getting warm...
Oh, the shit is going to hit the fa--
Whoa.  Name's Hawkins, Eddie Hawkins. My nickname's Hudson Hawk, but don't call me Hudson, not even as a joke. The Nuns at St. Agnes called me that and they're the ones who helped make me what I am today. Not a compliment...
Let's just say, I never saw E.T.
Wha--
You better believe I can.  I'm sick of people telling me what I have to do.
Hey, don't take your disguise so seriously.
I hope you know what....
How many times do I have to say it?  I didn't put the hit on Little Eddie... Never had anything against that kooky chimp.  I actually found him, "endearing."
We want Da Vinci's sketchbook, what do they call it, the Codex.
For those kind of wages, I could have built the factory in America! They're Vietnamese, can't we just give them more Bart Simpson shirts? I hear depressing news like this and I want to commit genocide!  Alfred, hold my calls.  So, Hawk! The Hawkster!  What do you think of the vehicle?
So Hawkasaurus, I won't mince words...
Oh... Let's see.  There are organizations that think we wanted the "Sforza" for reasons other than putting it in the Da Vinci museum we're building in Vinci. Hopefully, these organizations think our plan has been ruined with the explosion of our replica. If I seem vague, grand.  We want a low profile on this, that's why I got Kaplan and the Candy bars involved.  I helped George help the Mario Brothers and Gates help get you out....
Why do you show your parole officer such disrespect? Especially after I got you such a nice job.
Guess I know who wears the penis in this family.
Bunny, not you too?
Except yours-yours.  The goal of world domination.  Well, if you put it that way, Minnie.  How can I resist?
Don't be stupid...they...
Hawk, Hawk, Hawk.  Enjoying Italy?  I always had a soft spot for Rome.  Did my first barehanded strangulation here.  Communist politician.
Something short.
Snappy.
The Hoopsucker!
The Hoop-dee-doo!
Nobody told me! Nobody told me! You sold all of our stock?
I had twenty thousand shares! I'd be a millionaire now!
But -- who are you -- what d'you do here?
So if you know everything about Hudsucker, tell me why the Board decided to make Norville Barnes president.
That smart?!
A sawbuck!
I'm sorry we had to take the stairs. It was just that horrible little elevator boy...
A little naive perhaps but -- thank you -- armed with determination, a solid work ethic, and an indomitable belief in the future --
Oh, of all the foolish... Listen, do you take shorthand? Are you familiar with the mimeograph machine?
The picture was fine! It's what that knuckle-headed dame wrote underneath! Of all the irresponsible... Amy, take this down: Dear Miss Archer. I call you 'Miss' because you seem to have 'missed' the boat completely on this one! How on earth would you know whether I'm an imbecile when you don't even have the guts to come in here and interview me man to man! No, change 'guts' to 'courage.' No, make it 'common decency.' These wild speculations about my intelligence --
I'm sure I --
Well, I --
...You know! For kids!
Smitty.
...You do?
What a beautiful thought.
I wish it were that simple, Norville. I wish I was still a gazelle, and you were an antelope or an ibex.
Your i --
Shutup! -- and don't think I haven't noticed how you've changed. I used to think you were a swell guy -- well, to be honest I thought you were an imbecile --
...Oh, it's you! Lookin' for a nitwit to buy your lunch?!
It's a juice and coffee bar, man, like I been tellin' ya --
...It's the most beautiful t'ing I ever saw.
Say, buddy! Who's the most liquid businessman on the street?
Oh, uh... Buzz... Is it important?
-- I can't have every deadbeat on the Hudsucker payroll pestering me with their idiotic brainwaves!
...You don't?
But, Buzz --
Yessir.
...This'll only take a moment.
You're fired.
That reminds me, Mr. Mu... uh, Sid. I never did give you that--
Thank you, Sid, but the reason I mention it is, it would require such a small capital investment -- again, you're the expert here --
Finally.
Sorry I'm late, Sid. That back nine at Riverdale is really murder.
Yellowstone.
Good morning, miss.
She was very sick and then she went mindless, Miss.
What's this?
No, miss.  He's just as he was in the beginning -- on the front part of an enormous boat.
If you say, miss.  And the enormous boat brought the long-ago Fathers and the long-ago Mothers of us all - chained down to the deep side floor.
Some of this native nonsense. The Houngan has his prescription and Dr. Maxwell and I have ours.
A missionary's widow?  It isn't very likely, is it?
Frankly, my dear, I didn't expect anything like this from a nice level-headed girl.  What are you driving at?
Does she suffer?
They didn't teach it at Memorial Hospital.  I had my suspicions, though, about the Directress of Training.
That is good.  But I'd like to know more about the case.
That will mean another interview, won't it?
But it's so far away...
I wondered about your different accents.  I'm still wondering about your names -- Rand and Holland.
Don't worry.  I wasn't missed.  The only important man here is the owner.
Where do you think you're going?
Does she suffer?  Does she know what she is?
It's easy enough to read the thoughts of a newcomer. Everything seems beautiful because you don't understand.  Those flying fish -- they are not leaping for joy. They're jumping in terror.  Bigger fish want to eat them. That luminous water -- it takes its gleam from millions of tiny dead bodies. It's the glitter of putrescence.  There's no beauty here -- it's death and decay.
A figure of St. Sebastian.
And what is so alarming about the tower, Miss Connell?
You didn't find your patient so frightening in the daylight, did you?
I've never given it much thought.
Good morning, Miss Connell.
You have helped me.  I want you to know I'm sorry I brought you here. When I thought of a nurse, I thought of someone hard and impersonal.
What you saw tonight -- two brothers at each other's throat and a woman driven mad by her own husband?  Do you love that?
I think I do.  I've often talked a little voodoo to get medicine down a patient's throat.
And what happened then, Mrs. Rand?
Ah -- that's where reason took hold.
Two things had happened, Mrs. Rand. One was that your daughter-in-law had been taken ill with a fever. The other thing -- completely disconnected -- was that you had wished her ill, because she had hurt your sons.
Investigation of what?
Dr. Maxwell is right, Mother.
And speaking of which, you have those market share charts Mr. Shackley was asking about?
Well, it's the funniest thing. I've been talking to some investors -- a little outside venture, you understand, between you and me -- about a scheme to manufacture a new Styrofoam packaging. Little peanut like pieces that can really keep an item free from trauma during shipping. Miraculous. Anyway, it turns out the genius behind the whole project is your neighbor, Jim Williams. How about that!
OK, OK, the defense rests.  Want another?
You're staring at me.
I did, but -- somebody should probably see her, talk to her... You think she's ok?
Oh not again Elena! If we've got problems, why can't you just come out and talk about them.
I... I think I am...
Whatever that means Elena -- And you complain about me not communicating... I thought it was --
Yikes -- I was hoping to wear this thing to the Halford's Friday.
What?
Yeah, that one.
I have no idea.
I'm not surprised.
Oh lord. You think I'm so dense. And now you want to be seen with your dense wife at the cocktail party. You want to wear that ridiculous shirt which doesn't go with those pants at all. You want to wear that, and you want me to shake hands with your friends and make conversation and dress up in an outfit that shows a lot of cleavage and you're not going to accord me the respect of talking honestly about this... You don't really know what this feels like.
This just isn't the best moment for this.
That this was going to be a key party?
You'll get some sleep on the couch out there?
Hi dad.
Yeah?
You have a point there. That's a very good point. We're having an affair. Right. An explicitly sexual relationship. Your needs. My needs. You're absolutely right.
Here.
Listen, Benjamin Hood. I have obligations that precede your... from before you showed up. One or two, you know, good-natured encounters, that doesn't mean I'm... I'm not just some toy for you. When I remembered some chores I wanted to get done before the party, I just did them, that's all, because I wanted to do them before I saw Jimmy.
Dad stop it!
Fascist!
-- Well what am I supposed to call you?
I was actually trying to see about getting a little advice, you know --
But dad, you guys truly hated each other, I mean really hated each --
What?
You want coffee or something?
Now don't make me feel as if I'm being too forward, OK? If you don't --
That's fine. I wouldn't expect you to see it any other way.
You okay?
Hi mom.
Oh I thought I'd steal the station wagon, drive up to a commune. Or set the house on fire. You know.
How'd you know?
Elena. Elena Hood, am I right?
My daughter. I haven't been on a bike for years.  When was the last time you rode a bike?
Check it out. Not for the faint of heart.
Everything's gonna freeze, the big freeze.
Come on Paulie, share the wealth. You copped 'em from her mom's stash anyway.
Hey.  I'll take this stuff.
Would it matter?  And what's that?
Yeah but you don't even know me really.
It's beyond mere physical attraction.
How do you know this shit?
Geometry?
It's freezing.
I don't ever want to see you.
Maybe we can mess around. You know, only if you want to...
When worlds collide.
Charles.
Hello, Charles.
How are the parental units functioning these days?
I don't know. Dad seems a little weird.
Her name's Libbets.
Right.
All my model planes.
He's dead.
I love you.
Didn't want to miss anything.
Don't give misdemeanors a bad rap.
I want you to check this out, Ellie.
Who's playing?
How much closer would you say you were?
What about your shoulder?
Sorry about...
He would have liked that.
Oh, you know.  Don't feel that much. Bullet went right through.
We're sure it's hers?
I'll stick it in the evidence locker...
I'll call him now.
Forget your pager?
Good.
No.
They're all over everybody.
We'll talk when we get back to Seattle.
Weston Dobbs killed an eight year-old boy and left him hanging in the basement like a piece of meat.  You remember that?
I'm not expecting anyone.
One of your cases?
Did you love her?
How should I know?...
I never met anyone from Seattle before.
No...
My arm!
She used some stupid code name.
She was only seventeen.
You gave her gifts.
Doesn't sound like a mentor to me.
What about him?
Couldn't get it up, Walter?
Where's your back-up?
Who made us what we are?
The one who made you should have told you this. The one who left the old world for the new...
Are these not the answers you came for?
Where is she? Where's Claudia?
You can't believe I'd leave without her. Armand! You must save her! You have no choice.
And yet you knew what I would o.
I want some more.
I'm not your daughter.
Stop pestering me then!
Oh, Claudia, you've outdone yourself. Where did you find them?
Absinthe? You gave then absinthe?
Should we burn him? Bury him? What would he have liked, Louis?
He belongs with those reptiles, Louis. He deserved to die.
You never talked to me like that - in all these years.
The ship is sailing wihout us!
They are ducklings, that will grow into swans. Whereas I must be the duckling forever.
You know her?
I lothe them! I can't stand the sight of them! Stupid bourgeois Parisians, all dressed in black like some private club! I've searched for them the world over and I despise them!
He wants you as you want him. He's been waiting for you. He wants you for a companion. He bides his time that place. he finds them as dull and lifeless as we do.
I wish I were. But if I were, what would I want with you?
Did I hear a yes?
Come, you're going to feed now.
You must get into it. It's the only safe place for you when the light comes.
There's nothing in the world now that doesn't hold some...
But we can live without taking human life. It's possible.
The trick is not to think about it. See that one? The widow St. Clair? she had that gorgeous young fop murder her husband. She's perfect for you. Go ahead.
What have you done to me? You've condemned me to hell.
They know about us. They see us dine on empty plates and drink from empty glasses.
Where are we?
Lestat!
I didn't want to kill her.
You are the devil! You are the instrument of Satan!
You believe this, don't you? That you're a vampire? You really think...
What about coffins?
Did he die in the fire?
Is this what you want? You ask me for this after all I've told you?
It sure is a beautiful old hotel.
Storm season?
I want off this island.
Then I'll call the mainland for a charter.
I don't know, man. Maybe we should keep going, find a phone --
I got work to do. Take the bake elsewhere.
I thought you were out of town!
That could break the machine.
The number's unlisted...
You get any sleep at all?
It's okay...He doesn't believe me. That's his right. I'm starting to think I'm crazy, too.
I'm your best friend...You could have told me the truth about what happened. I would've understood.
I don't know...
Oh, god, it's you --
I got in early. I was excited...  Who was that guy?
Ray, I can't...
I understand something.
Hey. I'm really glad you called... I'm sorry.
Voodoo.
You've got all these theories but where is he? Where? Where's your fisherman killer?
Julie! Wait! You okay?
This was not my idea.
Deep breaths --
Julie? What's wrong?
Oh, Will! I'm sorry.
What? What are you talking about? Where?
There was a body! I swear it!
Come on. We're gonna be okay.
Why are you doing this to me?
If you can say all you gotta say in a minute then I don't wanna hear it.
Is there a problem here?
Something is gonna hit your butt if you don't quit complaining.
Ain't nothin' free in this world. Everybody says it, and it's true.  I wanted you all to have a good trip.
You sure you didn't pick up my hair tie?
You think that's a good place to hide?
Why? He can't help us.
Hell, that's worth three, easy. And you got your waiting period.
What's the matter, boy trouble?
What's going on?
You stumbled into my hiding place.
Can't talk right now.
The last day of the season. Yeah, we heard.
Where is everybody?
Where'd Estes go?
I wonder if my editor's psychic? Reports from the Greek front are going to be a little vague.
I'll go up and take a look at the General -- perhaps sit with him.
Well --
We will see who is the first to die.
I suppose you want to hear my prayer to Hermes.
) You feel the symptoms?
I'm glad you and the General didn't have to leave us. We would feel quite deserted..
My father -- I'm alone, Oliver, completely alone!
If Mr. Albrecht is right, we'll all be free in a few days.  I suppose you'll be going on to Athens?
I wish I didn't have such bitter knowledge of you, Cathy.
Your father loved me.  He wanted to marry me. But he was afraid of hurting the gentle, delicate Cathy. You spoiled his life --you've ruined mine --
What if he is?
You will not say one single word. I know your secret.
No. No. I won't believe it. He's not dead.
I'm a woman -- a lonely woman. I have few friends.
You do not know her last name -- you do not know from where she came?
Your daughter is ill.
You know that sound, Oliver?
Well, at any rate, I would like to say goodbye to the girl.
Is this what you wanted to speak to me about?
That's ridiculous -- Thea's lovely, gentle --
Please.. You shouldn't laugh --
Thea, what's wrong?
Oh, that Vrykolaka business. You mustn't be too angry with him, Thea. He's an old man and now with all this trouble -- the disappointment in not being able to lead his own army to victory -- cooped up here waiting for death - naturally his mind goes back to the things he believed when he was an ignorant lad in some mountain village.
I knew that feuds still went on, but I didn't think people like you and the General would be involved.
Thea, what is this? What are you trying to tell me? "He stole your mother" --
I'm not crying, Mr. Potter.
Times are bad, Mr. Potter. A lot of these people are out of work.
Know you? Are you kiddin'? I've been looking all over town trying to find you. I saw your car piled into that tree down there, and I thought maybe . . . Hey, your mouth's bleeding; are you sure you're all right?
We're all excited around here.  My brother just got the Congressional Medal of Honor. The President just decorated him.
Oh, no.
Oh, no, no. We don't use money in Heaven.
Oh, tut, tut, tut.
You have no car.
What's the matter with him. I never saw Nick act like that before.
What?
Are you sure this is Bailey Park?
Clarence . . .
She's . . .
Poor George . . . Sit down.
The Bailey Building and Loan. It was up there.
Hey, Ernie!
Bert, the cop, sent this over. He said to float away to Happy Land on the bubbles.
Oh -- Clarence. Hasn't got his wings yet, has he? We've passed him up right along.
Look, Daddy . . . paste it.
Hmmmm . . .
Hmmm . . .
Hmmm . . .
Well then, how do you know?
Oh . . .
Mother, you know, I can see right through you -- right back to your back collar button . . . trying to get rid of me, huh?
Oh, it's wonderful.
You want a martini?
I thought when we put him on the Board of Directors, he'd ease up on us a little bit.
We have that all figured out. You see, Harry'll take my job at the Building and Loan, work there four years, then he'll go.
Well, no younger than I was.
Got a match?
She's home cooking the fatted calf. Come on, let's go.
George.
Oh . . . me? Oh, well, I feel funny enough already, with all these kids.
Say hello to New York for me.
Violet Bick!
All of it?
Pop!
Thank you, sir. Quite a cigar, Mr. Potter.
Oh, yes, George Bailey. Whose ship has just come in -- providing he has brains enough to climb aboard.
In the meantime, I'll draw up the papers.
I have a big deal coming up that's going to make us all rich. George, you remember that night in Martini's bar when you told me you read someplace about making plastics out of soybeans?
Oh, I don't know . . . why not right here? You remember that old tool and machinery works? You tell your father he can get that for a song. And all the labor he wants, too. Half the town was thrown out of work when they closed down.
Money? Yeah . . . well, a little.
Made up your mind yet?
Well, hello.
I'm not very good at this.
Do I look as funny as you do?
No, I don't want to be rude.
Well, of course I like her. She's a peach.
George . . . George . . . George . . .
Where are we going?  Look at this. There's the kitty, Ernie. Here, come on, count it, Mary.
After that, who cares?
Just a minute, dear. Oh-oh . . .
Hi.
Oh, George, George!
Oh, Mom -- I'm chairman of the eats committee and we only need a couple of dozen.
Well, then . . it's usually customary to bring the money with you.
For me...?
Oh, shit.
It's okay, it's okay....
Easy, easy -- you'll swamp us!
Get on the rocks!
Why not?
Shut up.
Turkeys!  Eat wind!
Your dad must be really pissed.
They're okay, if they got little white canes and tin cups.
Same as always -- glub-glub, bubble-bubble, stroke-stroke. There sure is some weird shit on the bottom of the ocean.
The lighthouse?
Goddamn it, Sean, you listen to me or I will kick your ass, do you hear me?
Coming up!
How're we going to do that floating on this garbage...?
Chief....
I never heard of a 908.
Diver's camera.  Tom Andrews brought it up from under that abandoned cruiser.
I know just where to go.
Nine-thirty, ten maybe.
How long ago?
I can't let you take her out.
About 10 degrees off your star- board bow, take a heading leeward of Sand Island, and lay her north by northeast....
See where Cable Junction is?  Look to the left.  The lighthouse.  That's it.
Don't go out if it's rough or any- thing, huh?  We've had a lot of trouble.
Is Hooper coming to dinner?
Michael.
It came up during the meeting.
There is nothing to discuss.
Is that what it is?  Dollars? Money?  I'll pay for it.  Take it out of my salary.
As soon as I heard about it, I called you.  This thing is big! His arms indicate big.
Length, 22 feet, 8 inches.
The whale's mouth?
And sound.
It's either a Great White, or another killer whale.
Need a ride?
Thank you.  I'll tell him.
Nothing.
I know what you're going to say.
In the city, it happened all the time -- some Kid o.d.'s on a rooftop, top, a drunk gets cut in pieces under the Brooklyn local, old people die alone in shitty apartments and three weeks later someone calls the cops because of the smell and the flies.  Call the cops.  What are we, immune?
They have no right to treat you like that.  You've given them every- thing.  For four years, you've protected this town, the people on this island....
I know you did....
What're you going to do today?
Hey -- it's not your job any more. I'm going to be late for work.
And I stood by while you told the people from Ramada and Marriott that if they put up a hotel they'd need $800,000 worth of steel net around their beaches!  In New England? We all lost on that one.
What am I, an ass?  When you called me, I called Elkins, and her bosses. Nothing she saw is proof of anything.
Thank God you guys were all together. I got something for you.  Proof!
That's it.  Just do it, all right?
Did he raise the Kids?
Yeah?  Then what?
Did you say Cable Junction?
Some people.
I told you, remember?
What's wrong?
Terry!  You okay?
Doesn't hurt to ask.  Sometimes the most beautiful girls are the loneliest.
No class.
The wind drift is lateral.
Give me back my hat!
What about sailing?
What about the others?
Mmmmmm.
Anything.  Anything.
All of them.  Mike, Junior Vaughn, Brookie Peters, Pat, Lucy -- all that whole gang.
We'll be over by the lighthouse.
It'll be fun, come on!
I don't care.
Faster!  Faster!
Not tonight.
Who wouldn't.
Do I have to play with the little kids?
I want to go with you!
Michael....
Look -- if you're going to get in the way, you can just go home.
And if you have any questions about recreational possibilities, Ellen Brody here will be happy to answer them.
Well, not much longer to go.
Till this opens, not our wedding.
That macho pompous English --
My imagination isn't that good.
How come?
Where's the rubber band?
It's romantic down here.
Swim where?  Out there?  Oh, no, forget it, not me!  You go, I'm staying.
Kathryn...
Change your mind?
Honey, what is it?
Michael, take deep breaths.
Put it under your pillow and sleep on it and the tooth fairy will --
What's the big deal?  A shark got Overman, and we got the shark.
Come on!
I am.  You're not.
Are you okay?
Okay now.  Have Flipper flip or something.
Could be a new dance...  Walking the Shark.
That's what life is, Doctor. Full of chances to hurt yourself, or somebody else.
He's big as a bloody bus!
Give me a ride?
Musclehead?
You gonna work at The Kingdom?
You were great out there!
Besides that.
Isn't this fun!
No...  It can't be.
Take it up!
The space shuttle has landed!
Shut up, Tod!  Be serious!
Ahhh, ahhh...
Hutton, how the hell did you get my crane?
Yeah, well I didn't!
Watch it, Brody.  You're ruining the shot.
South Georgia, Antarctica.
The world's southern most reaches.
Reach for the limit I always say.
How far away is filter number four?
Hey, I'm proud of you, kid.
You want to show this?
You'll spoil her.
Thea....
It has its virtues.  It hasn't fallen down yet....
Can I make sandwiches...?
He was such a good-natured kid... Always going out of his way....
Make a list.
Big unveiling ceremony in a couple of weeks....
I take out the garbage, because...I'm glad we got that straightened out....
What the hell are we arguing about?
Off....
The doctor said she should be all right...She's in shock....
Usually it's all he talks about...You mustn't worry....
Sweet breezes...Sweet women....
Get the bang sticks.  We're going down.
I hope the man knows what he's doing....
The fish.  Check it....
Ask the big doctor about his work.  Tough life you Bahamian beach bum... Playing in the water all day....
A big one....
In a minute....
No, no...It's too dangerous....
What's it cost to take a ride on that plane...?
I will.  I'll miss you, Grandma.
I want you to get out of the water....
How are you doing?
I'm not going to bother you anymore about your work....
You and Sean used to make....
I'm leaving in a few days.  I don't want to do that with you unhappy....
No....
Can you just go off...?
I...I can't explain it.  It's just something I feel.
It was no accident....
I'm only doing this to get out of my family's hair....
You're impossible....
How do you like flying?
A drink with an umbrella in it....
I have this overwhelming desire to kiss you, Ellen Brody.
Because it wouldn't occur to you to know why.  Blushing suits you....
I tried to tell you...I tried....
They had them on the big one....
I'll get it back next time.
I don't know why I fish here...Never catch anything...Must be a sign under the water...'Beware, Hoagie's here....'
What say we get the hell out of here, Ellen Brody. ...
Jake tells me you're going to have to fly for the rest of your life to pay off what you lost at the crap table....
I want you to leave her alone.  I don't want you involving her in....
The damn thing is going to have our asses....
She has good days and bad...I don't know....
Let me speak to Ellen....
How many...?
You moved any slower, you'd grow roots...We've got a schedule...shake it, man....
I know how to tag a damn conch....
Money is money....
Trouble with you, Jake, is you have no sense of humor....
When I got the grant.....
Who?
Bring her about.  We're headed in the wrong direction....
We lost it....
Shove it....
What the hell are you doing?
Jake.
How much longer?  This is supposed to be your party.
I knew there was a reason I could afford this.  To the woman of my dreams.. Who grows more beautiful....
Now wait a minute... I'm being serious here....
She's in management....
Manage the whole damn place some day. I'm looking forward to living in the style to which I would like to become accustomed....
Where's Lenny?
You'll never guess. Shut your eyes, Mama. Shut 'em for little Jakie. Ha. I'm gonna steal something.  Ha, ha, ha, ha. I'll give it back to you some day, too, you see if I don't. Mama, darlin', if I'm a success in this show, well, we're gonna move from here. Oh yes, we're gonna move up in the Bronx. A lot of nice green grass up there and a whole lot of people you know. There's the Ginsbergs, the Guttenbergs, and the Goldbergs. Oh, a whole lotta Bergs; I don't know 'em all. And I'm gonna buy you a nice black silk dress, Mama. You see Mrs. Friedman, the butcher's wife, she'll be jealous of you.
I'm sorry to worry you with this, but we had a real serious robbery, and we- 're chasing a white V.W. van? You guy came up an the computer, so as a matt- er of routine we have to check. Could you tell me who's driven it recently?
How about any guys on your staff?
What about that kid, Ross?
We give it one more hour. Did the photographer do the dogs?
Who is who?
Not today .. I'm on a diet to- day .. I'll take a diet soda ..
You gotta stop smoking ..
I don't mean this "system" shit that keeps you sucking, I mean <u>stop</u> .. I was exactly like you are .. I used to wake in the night - heart going so hard I coulda made love with my left tit .. If I can stop, <u>you</u> can ..
Someone bet me a dollar ..
Because I dislike her too much ..
Let me just keep going a while. She might remember something?
I had one <u>puff</u> on a <u>pipe</u>.
Did he shut you down?
Stop it.
You gotta stop calling Los Angeles .. You're dragging L.A. around with you like an addiction.  Look at the shit you're putting yourself through? For what? For <u>nothing</u>, I know it, I been there. Remember me? Up to my asshole in anger, living off the vitamins in cigarettes?  If there's a body under the snow, <u>fuck</u> <u>it</u>. Let somebody else worry about it. You gotta accept you stopped living in that world, & try and give yourself a break in this ..
She wasn't lying about the van.
Nothing you gotta say do I wanna hear right now. So save yourself saying it.
I dunno what I can do to help you?
Jesus. What are you doin?
Why did he ask if it was frozen?
Have you got a match on the bullet?
I'm talking, outside the girl?
Got a letter from this Goodridge guy? Says, you're upsetting his students?
Kid told me he didn't take it?
Vehicle references.
I know what a "witness" is.
John? .. You never said that on the phone? .. What makes you think his name was John?
Can I see your hands?
What color was it?
I suppose I'm the worst witness you've ever had?
If I came to the diner with you, would you bring me back?
I'm sorry .. I don't like sitting in the middle of a restaurant .. I feel like everyone's looking at me ..
"Thoughts that lie too deep for tears."
You're looking worried again, Helena?
He don't know that. I didn't.
A blind girl can just walk out of here, and you don't know who with?
When did John divorce?
What was she like?
How you doing on those shoes?
Such a shame .. She's a really sweet kid ..
She married some English prick.
You think you're the only guy ever worked a homicide? I was a big-city cop too. And I bust- ed the clock on fucken Jennifer. I know more about this man than you'll over know - and that's how I know it ain't him - you- 're investigating a soap-opera ..
Shut up, King Jay ..
I wonder what would make him do a thing like that?
Who told you?
The power move is to go unannounced.  Black suit, right?
Well, it worked, and I will not let you fail.  You are Jerry Ma- fuckin-guire.
Now.
I know.  Sorry I threw a scare into our lives there --
You've never been alone and you can't be alone --
Oh Jerry.
Don't let him stay up too late.
Now what did you lose?
Oh tsht. Yes.
So I know this is a bad time, but -- you will have a medical program, right?
Honey -- later, okay?  Whoop.  Wait.
Okay, have we gone over everything? Back on Tuesday, right?
Hey you.
Don't worry about me.  I can get jobs --
Dennis Wilburn called from Arizona to say he's faxing in the new Tidwell offer on Thursday morning, and you'll be happy.
We'll see you soon, honey. Bye.
Maybe you should call her.
I think you should not come in, or come in depending on how you feel.
Why do you love me?
It's my fault.
I don't need you to "stick."
What if it's true?  "Great at friendship bad at intimacy." I mean, come on.  It's the theme of my bachelor film --
I don't like to give up.
This used to be my specialty. I was good in a living room.  Send me in there, I'll do it alone. And now I just... I don't know... but on what was supposed to be the happiest night of my business life, it wasn't complete, wasn't nearly close to being in the same vicinity as complete, because I couldn't share it with you.  I couldn't hear your voice, or laugh about it with you.  I missed my wife.  We live in a cynical world, and we work in a business of tough competitors, so try not to laugh --  I love you.  You complete me.
What about medical?
You know how much those Well Child exams cost --
He just lost his best client.  He called from the plane.  I invited the guy over.
I heard.
Forgot your keys --
No, Roy.  I'm not gonna cry.
Matt, I came here because in all honesty your son is just another piece of cattle to SMI.  But to me --
Oh, thank you.
I want him to go number one in the draft, and I want him to play.
Denver is where he should be.
Apparently, Denver wanted to deal with him instead of you.
--  now to recap, I want to stay in Arizona, I want my new contract, I like you, you're nice to my wife, I will stay with you, that's what I'm doing for you, but here's what you're gonna do for me. You listening?
You are not allowed to act this way.
Do your job, man, don't tell me to dance.
I'll get you some quick work --
First, single mothers don't "date." They have been to the circus, you know what I'm saying? They have been to the puppet show and they have seen the strings. You love her?
The kid is amazing.
We can still take the offer, Rod.
Well, just stay healthy. I will show you the kwan.
Don't I know.  Now go home to your wife.
That's an answer.
Why not --
You're with the sports people on the plane, right?
Bobbi Fallon.  BPI.  I'm producing the Coke commercials for the playoffs.
Well, it bothered me somewhat. And I got quiet.  And now she's quiet and we're both pouting a little, you know.  And I decide I'm not going to propose.  The mood is not right. Why be impulsive? Now at this point I know she knows that I was going to propose and didn't.  And she knows I know.  So the entire sixty mile ride back to the airport, we don't speak. And we're both good at that.  We fly to Honolulu in silence.  We check into the Pro Bowl hotel --
You gonna get that --
Gimme a second here... Tidwell... Arizona contract... new glass cabinet...
You wanted smaller.
SMI represents all three quarterbacks on your team, where's their loyalty going to be?  You stay with me, I'd fight for YOU alone.  You'd be my only client on that team...
They do, my brother.
I won't tell.
Show me the animal, Jerry!
Eric!
First off let me say as a dinosaur enthusiasts, Amanda and I have admired your work for years.
That's him. That's Eric!
It's not safe.
I don't remember
Sweetheart, you're okay.  You're okay.  You're okay.
My own kid was right in front of me and I didn't do a damn thing.
I should have tried. It should have been me on that beach back there, not Billy.
We need to stick to the plan. Head for the coast.
PAUL!
So Mr. Kirby, tell me, when you climbed K2, did you base camp at 25- or 30,000 feet?
Eric!
Listen Alan, I really appreciate you bringing me along.
They never got that big.
We could co-write a paper.
Okay. Goodbye, Ellie.
Know what this is?
How much of this island have you explored?
Why?
The lady you called, how do you know she can help us?
What do you think is going to happen with the dinosaurs?
That's hard to believe.
Billy!
How did you know?
I got a call from a gentleman who's going to Costa Rica, or thereabouts. If he's to be believed, it's a most, uh, unique expedition.  And very well-funded.
How do you mean?
Is there an antidote?
Why didn't you tell us about these guys, Ian?!
Resentful.
I didn't know you -- weren't well.
They do have motives.  Why did you want to see me?  Your message said it was urgent.
I don't believe you.
I've been putting this together for over a year.  I have personal suggestions for your entire team, phone numbers, contact people.  They won't believe you about what they're going to see, so don't bother trying to convince them.  Just use my checkbook to get them there. I'll fund your expedition through my personal accounts, as such money and equipment as you need, but only if you leave immediately.  If we hesitate, all will be lost.
The empty shells are crushed and trampled.  The young stay in the birth environment, that's conclusive!
Is that kid still bothering you?
Well, is he?
I don't care about the trials, I want to be with you.  I could be your research assistant, like I was in Austin.
Cancel that, Dieter.
Carnivores hunt near stream beds.  Do you want to set up base camp or an all-you-can-eat people bar?
Killing lessons?  Heartwarming.
Had to.  To keep him still for the trip.
What is?
What is that?
We took to the rock.
It's... behind... us.
So, you two were just, uh, telling old campfire stories, were you?
You version of it.
Their what?
Then this is our chance.
I think she's with Sarah!
You ever heard of Gambler's Ruin?
Just -- flawed.  Very deeply flawed.
You gentlemen feel you have to do this now?
Can you set up?
That's impossible, they can't have the sensory equipment to track it all the way here!
Ian.  It's guano.
Ruining everything, that's what they're doing.  You could choke on the diesel smoke already!
Where's Kelly?
Hey, we came here to observe, you came here to strip-mine the place! It's a looter mentality, all you care about is what you can take.
That storm center hasn't dissipated or changed course. We're going to have to cut the tour short, I'm afraid. Pick it up again tomorrow where we left off.
Woah, woah, woah, what the hell, what the hell?
You shouldn't use my name.
That's up to your guy on the boat.  Seven o'clock tomorrow night, at the east dock. Make sure he got it right.
Yours was fully illustrated, honey.
Doctors, if you please - - I have to insist we get moving.
Pretty sure.
Sure.  I've got a gas powered jeep.  I can drop her at the visitor's center before I make the boat with the others.
There you are.  Out you come.
Malcolm's okay for now.  I gave him a shot of morphine.
Carousel.
This is just a delay, that's all this is.  All major theme parks have had delays.  When they opened Disneyland in 1956, nothing worked, nothing.
Mr. Arnold?  He's not answering me.  Okay I'm on the grating.
The taphonomy sure looks that way.
Well, not one of those, well yeah, a possibly one at some point could be a good thing.  What's so wrong with kids?
Alright, the one on the airplane had an accident, but usually babies don't smell.
Oh, shit.
Oh Ellie.  It's so beautiful.  It's the most beautiful thing I ever saw.
- - a gizzard - -
Do you see anything?
I'm going with you.
Okay, I'm on channel two.
Oh my God.  Aw, God.
No. We can't.
It's anti-nature.
Alan?
Dino droppings?
Seven days?!  Seven days?!  Oh, great.  Oh good - - clever.
Yes?
Hammond hates inspections.  They slow everything down.
If two experts sign off on the island, the insurance guys'll back off.  I already got Ian Malcolm, but they think he's too trendy.  They want Alan Grant.
The full fifty mile of perimeter fence are in place?
This is overwhelming, John.  Are these characters  animatronics?
I don't believe it.  I expected you to come down here and defend me from these characters and the only one I've got on my side it the bloodsucking lawyer!?
Are you okay?  Can you move?  Tim!  Are you okay?
I threw up.
It's okay to call them brontosaurs, Tim.  It's a great name.  It's a romantic name.  It means "thunder lizard".
You know what this is?  It's a dinosaur egg.  The dinosaurs are breeding.
I can't!  I'm scared!
to Grant) She's, uh - - tenacious.
I must've touched something.  This happens all the time. It must be my fault.  Machines hate me.
Well, I didn't ask.  Why wouldn't they be?
Oh my God!
Hey, we were saving that!
Not just kids - - for everyone.  We're going to open next year.  Unless the lawyers kill me first.  I don't care for lawyers.  You?
That thing's got a what, twenty-five, twenty-seven foot neck?
- - and you're going to sit there and try to tell me it can push blood up a thirty-foot neck without a four-chambered heart and get around like that?!  Like that!?  This is like a knockout punch for warm-bloodedness.
Blood temperature feels like high eighties.
Hear that?  Are you hearing this?
What if the dinosaur comes back while we're all asleep?
What's that?
Let's go!
C'mon Tim, move down, damn it!
You'll have to get use to Dr. Malcolm!  He suffers from a deplorable excess of personality, especially for a mathematician!
But this is nature!  Why not give an extinct species a second chance?!  I mean, Condors. Condors are on the verge of extinction - - if I'd created a flock of them on the island, you wouldn't be saying any of this!  have anything to say at all!
I don't think there's been any debate.  There's no debate...my mistakes....
We miss you.
I'm sorry - - I'm sorry - -
That's not funny.
You tell them if they come up to seventy-five, I'll cut them in on the Crystal Lake package.
Beautiful trees... sturdy trunks... lots of branches...  We can do some great logging up here.
Okay... well... I think it's this way...
I think we're lost.
I didn't think there were any houses up here...
Two.
What's going on?
What happened?
Who?
Three.  Where's my client?
A house?
Sorry.
Don't get me wrong. I don't care. But the professional part of me is interested in how you rationalize what you do.
Oh?
So Jason doesn't sleep... how does that help us?
Well, that's it. He'll be asleep in a few minutes, but his first REM-cycle probably won't kick in for another hour or so.  Is there a place we can get something to eat in this town?
I think I'm onto something, Joe.
I thought you said Krueger burned to death.
Then I'd say we should put Jason under again... run another tape on him and see what happens. We'll get extra data this time. Video... infrared... the works.
What happened? Where's Jason?
It's only majestic from here. When you get closer you see it for what it really is.
Fine -- terrible.
-- Ah, but what if it <u>wasn't</u>?
I read the one about the penal colony.
Gabriela was right -- it's easier for me to understand suicide. I'm a practicing suicide.
Where do you get your ideas?  Only joking -- I'm just joking.  Let's go to a brothel then, Kafka, come on.
The cemetery is nearer the Castle than anywhere else -- wasn't it part of the Castle originally?  -- I always assumed there'd be a gate or something.  Isn't there?
-- You appreciate my writing.
Oh, don't they?  I think you underestimate my station in this office and overrate your own.
You've been with the firm for nearly nine years.  You've done your work diligently, there are no complaints on that score.  But there's more to the job than the work -- there are other people to consider -- and frankly, Kafka, we eel your social situation could bear improving.
Was there something else?
I'm Kafka -- I work upstairs in Accident --
Oh -- well, I thought he once mentioned --
The police would know the difference, wouldn't they?
-- I don't know the Musil district.
You're shocked at the thought of Eduard tossing a bomb through a window.
Yes -- which is why "quiet, dependable people" have to take charge of their own lives.
How often does one of our clerks have business in the house of records?
Or what if there really <u>was</u> an error? -- I don't know what kind -- any kind that needed correcting -- and what if Burgel was responsible for it?  One mistake -- even a small one in a firm like ours -- it could cost him a promotion.
I think you've just escaped for the moment.  Just as I did.  As Eduard did.  As they let us do. But only for the moment.
I know better than you what people will say when they have to.  When they brought me in for questioning I informed on my friends the very first day.
When was the last time you saw Mr. Raban?
Did you go anywhere afterwards -- to have a drink perhaps?
Grown men don't normally fall into the river, do they?
-- I was just trying to finish some work!
My assistants.  I should have known. Nothing is given to me.  I have to acquire everything.
-- You said so yourself the firm is large and powerful.  If the discrepancy really was something big, Eduard's responsibility would still have to be small.  No poor young <u>clerk</u> could find himself in such a fix.
I believe we've exceeded his expectations.
May I ask where your two warders are?
Wait a minute.  "Raban?"  Where have I heard that name?
We've been together too long.  His personality is overflowing into mine and vice versa.
I understand he was wounded in the lung.
Then that's the place for us!
Hi - Carl Denham. I'm A big admirer of your work, sir. I've loved all your discoveries. I really want to work closely with you on this incredible find. It'll be good for you and good for me.
I thought that with your assistance we could have the premiere at the Albert Hall. We'll take out a full page ad in Variety - "The Lord Darrow Benefit screening". We'll invite the King of England - hell, we'll get the whole Royal Family along! It'd be good for them and good for us!
Oh God, it's that bloody yank!
No, it's not ok! We're not about to be robbed blind by some two-bit hustler on the make!
God, you're so obnoxious! Our work happens to be of great anthropological value!
I want to thank you.
It's the same image - Kong!
Pleased to meet you ... Hi, bow's it going? Pleased to meet you! Hi, Carl Denham ... How's it going?
You are most kind. We will be proud to assist you!
Are you gonna start it up?
Why? She's a junkie.
Sure dear, yes.
-- May I? It's so --
Not young; he wasn't young -- gray at the temples, he -- well actually he looked like you.
Arlyn and Jane commited suicide. He said they commited suicide.
Is that what he set me up for? Everything he's told me from the beginning? -- don't worry, don't --
I don't have to look at anything. I don't have --
Oh no.
It puzzles me so badly. I've done terrible things but I can't consider myself a terrible man. I've killed three people and I'd still want to say it was accident, do you see?
Excuse me Miss Daniel?
What about?
You said that.
Who?
Well could I have them back now hon? -- those tape recordings you've got downstairs -- OK? -- and if you want you can have a good time and I'll have a good time and--
What about the other things you've reported? --  -- being followed on the --
Is that how you get most of your dates? Someone gives your name to someone else?
-- you perverted hypocrite square bastards.
Gee I hope this doesn't make my cold any worse.
Did you like my friend Frankie?
About the dumper, didn't he tell you that?
You said it was!
-- Us city folks? The sin, the glitter, the wickedness?
You asked if there was anything more you could help me with.
The next few weeks I would like to know where you are all the time.
How can you do it to yourself?
You're right, I don't understand. Explain it to me.  You were scared. Arlyn Page, that scared you. Well it should; that's death. So what did you do, you ran straight for it, death. Ligourin kills women.
No, no you're right, I'm sorry. He uses women; he lets them kill themselves. Is that how you want it?
Oh boy, say, you think you're pretty good.
Listen to me: It's all right. I've been expecting something.
Where'd you spend last night?
Well suppose I hadn't come downstairs. Would you just have folded up and sneaked away?
Look at me. I'm pretty and sort of clever and very well intentioned, and dear God I'd tear your heart out!
How can you not think so? You know the things I can do.
What?
Can I carry something for you, to the car?  Will you kiss me?
Where, how?
I read your report. I had to go along with it -- the idea of this being a wild goose chase, Tom being nowhere around --
I've been up country, you know my summer place, my camp. I don't even have a telephone there. This morning they sent a messenger out, that you'd been trying to call me.
Some mistake perhaps that --
What?
I can't follow you.
John, how are you?
-- Usual case history -- this isn't a medical confidence, it's all of them -- broken family, lonely, confused, crummy childhood, early promiscuity, formal prostitution beginning in her teens, income twenty-five to thirty thousand a year.  Oh they don't keep the money: they get rid of it, they get pimps. Why?  Why do you want to know all this?
Not unusual.
Klute. With a K. K - L - U -
I know Tom Grunemann.
Sounds to me you better shake him again. Put him in a spot he has to do something more -- but this time give him a time and a place to do it.
I never could believe that Tom was a split personality. I never believed he was a Dumper; and I don't believe he disappeared of his own volition; and I don't believe he's alive.
Gov, want to leave me that one. How come he got to play with this one, anyway.
What do you like best about her?
Ladies and gentlemen...
On earth.
You forgot the milk.
What if she forgets?
Mom, I mean dad...
There, okay? Now that's just plain old hamburger.
Now listen to me, young man. Do you know what I had to go through to put this goddamn food on the goddamn table?
Daddy?
I'm sorry...
Is mom ever coming back?
See you in the morning light.
Sleep tight.  Don't let the bedbugs bite...
Objection.  You're leading the witness.
Objection.
No, son.  Daddy and mommy will never get remarried.
Mrs. Kramer, did you ever work in a job while you were married to your ex-husband?
And what is your present salary?
Mrs. Kramer, do you love your child?
Objection, your honor!  Counsel is harassing the witness.
Did your husband strike or physically abuse his child in any way?
Whom you've seen twice in a year? Mrs. Kramer, your ex-husband, wasn't he the longest personal relationship in your life?
I consider it less my failure than his.
I took two thousand out of the savings account.  That was what I had in the bank when we got married.
Here are the slips for the laundry and the cleaning.  They'll be ready on Saturday.
You just don't get it, do you?  I - am - really - and - truly - leaving - you.
Look at us, Joanna.  Just like any old married couple having dinner.  Who would believe it.
He looks like a terrific kid.
Ted...The reason I wanted to see you...I want Billy back.
Joanna, go be a mother.  Get married, have kids.  Don't get married, have kids.  Do whatever you want.  I don't give a damn. Just leave me out of it--and leave my baby out of it.
Goddamnit, Joanna. What the--
Ted, when we got married it was because I was twenty-seven years old and I thought I should get married and...when I had Billy it was because I thought I should have a baby...and I guess all I did was mess up my life and your life and--
He's already got one mother, he doesn't need two...He's yours...  I won't fight you for him any more. He's yours...
Hey, what's the rush?  C'mon, walk me a couple of blocks.
Wow!
Ted, this may sound a little rough, but we've just landed the biggest account in the history of this agency, right? And now it's up to us--that's you and me --to deliver the goods.  Ted, you're my main man, and if I can't depend on you a hundred and ten percent, twenty-four hours a day, because you're worried about a kid with a runny nose--
All right, Jim.  You said I was running this show, right? You said no decisions without my approval, right?  Well what the hell is this? What's going on, Jim?
Disappointing.  It only pulled a fourteen share and they were hoping for a twenty-five minimum, and...ah...they're not very happy and...Well, the guys have decided they want to...ah, re-think the entire concept and...Look, I don't like having to do this, okay?... But...I mean, what I mean is...ah, I'm going to have to...ah, let you go--
Hiya, Phyllis.  These are the Revlon contracts.  I thought you ought to check them out.
Kramer, I've got to go.  I've got an eight o'clock closing tomorrow down on Centre Street.
O'Connor's out to get you.  He's going to take the Fire and Ice account away from you.
Yeah?
And?
Oh, Christ!
I lost him?  I lost him?
Now, I'd advise you to wait outside.  It'll be eas--
All right, Thelma, you want to know what's going on?  I'll tell you what's going on.  I'll tell you exactly what's going on.
Listen, Joanna Kramer's got a goddamn good life.  She's got a husband that loves her.  She's got a terrific kid.  She's got a wonderful home--
I've got enough trouble raising my own kid.  I don't need another one.  Got it?
Wait a minute!  Wait a minute!
Hey, that's terrific.
We must go, Holiness.
All quiet?
No.
I do, now.
Where will you keep them?
Goodbye, Kundun.
Dalai Lama.
We bring greetings from Chairman Mao.
With much bloodshed.
General Chiang Chin-wu, the Chinese representative, is en route to Dromo. He is coming to meet you.
Oh, no. Where will he go?
You did. We washed you and wrapped you in sheepskin and took you to your father. That day the father got better. And that day, a pair of crows came to nest in our roof. I just remembered.
I will be back in a few days.
Who am I?
In the Pacific Ocean.
What was the warning of the Thirteenth Dalai Lama?
Tell me.
Has anyone died?
The Chinese would see such a pact as an open declaration of war.
Did you ever doubt it?
Of course, please, this way. Your servant may use the kitchen.
I turn you over again, today, Lhamo. One day, you will not be able to come running to us.
What do you think?
Yes.
This is Britain.
You will not come?
Don't eat all those sweets. You'll get sick.
The Chinese have one goal. The complete dissolution of our nation. The destruction of our culture. There is no room for Buddha in their world. Our only hope is to fight.
If we agree that we are part of China, nothing else will matter. Not trade, not defense. We will be lost.
I mean, my doubt. Why me? Am I Him?
No.
He just <u>appeared</u>.  You have no idea how he arrived in this lake?
You're a beautiful woman.
--<u>Who</u> <u>is</u> <u>he</u>?
Jesus Christ!!
What are <u>you</u> doing?!
I'm laying a spring trap!
I keep telling you, they <u>can</u> come on land, I don't wanna wake up in the middle of the night--
Again, I don't mean to be annoying with my questions.  But if it <u>is</u> a crocodile which I don't think it is.  And if they <u>do</u> charge these baby hatchling sounds...  why exactly would you want to be underwater at the time?  With you it makes sense.
Maybe he doesn't play well with others.
What's that?
I can arrest you!!
Where is he?!
No way.
So maybe Wildlife will try to save him, they're more equipped to--
I got something on the screen.
She didn't tell us about the other croc 'cause she was afraid we'd blow it's head off.
Hector.  The big one has no sense of humor.  And since <u>he's</u> the one who decides whether you get to play, try not to be your obnoxious self.
None of us actually <u>saw</u> anything.  I realize this Sir, but something flipped us over, I doubt very much it was a mink.
You <u>should</u> take a flax pole.
Two years married, divorced, used to be a lawyer, quit, I'm still waiting on his sperm count.
I'm an empty man, Kelly, wealth has robbed me of the dream in life, I sit here broken, a hollow sack--
Eh.  Fuck it.
I'm okay.
Did you make anything of the tooth?
And they're sure he didn't get tangled under the outboard somehow?
Why are you here?  Really.
I'm not making it up.
Whatever's out there <u>did</u> flip over a canoe--
You flew up here because your boss--
That was an awful thing to say to me.
He thinks they're what?
They respond pretty quick.  I'll wait till you get down before I turn it on.
You know they say the brain confuses fear for passion.
When you get scared, the brain releases a chemical, same chemical it releases when somebody's...  in high school, the thing to do was to take the girl to a scary movie.
Like little children.  You okay?
Sorry.
Who taught you be be a nurse?
You're having the best time of your life, aren't you?
Thanks for the... bandaid.
Well.  Goodnight.
Okay.  Okay.  Okay.
What?
We gotta get to Hector!!
What's that?
Hank.  The little cannon you brought, get it.  Guard the shoreline.  Otherwise, we're done. We made the I.D., our job is finished.
You said nobody came in here!
He just came up screaming.
Yes.
That's where they keep them.  You want me to bring the tooth out here?
Have you ever seen a dead body before, Ms. Scott?
We don't mean to invade your privacy but... was he ill, was he sick?
The tents were sent ahead, they should already be set-up.
I told you.  Two days, we'd have to camp.
He may be a kook but he's also been all over the world with them.  He even swam in the Grimetti with killer Niles all around him, he never got nipped.
Well Hector's a giant cracker.
Hank?
Hank!
What is she doing <u>now</u>?  <u>Mother</u> <u>of</u> <u>God</u>.
I'm sure this would offend you on principal but... could we keep in touch?
Hi.  Listen.  Could I steal you a second?
I had a great time last night. Again.
Yeah, that part.  There's... somebody who's um...
Hey.
This is what we do?
I'm not even a field person.
What do you expect, mugging me from behind?
Well you <u>shouldn't</u> have.  How did you even know where I was.
<u>You</u>?
No. He won't come after me.
"- every day."
Agent Starling! Telephone!
Get your field gear, take stuff for overnight. You're goin' with Crawford.
Some fishermen in West Virginia found an unidentified girl's body. It's a Buffalo Bill-type situation. Been in the water about a week, and Jack needs somebody that can print a floater. Think you can handle it?
Jack's pretty tough on you, isn't he? Impatient...
I'm sure it's a great town, Dr. Chilton, but my instructions are to talk to Lecter and report back this afternoon.
Lecter carved up nine people - that we're sure of - and cooked his favorite bits. We've tried to study him, of course - but he's much too sophisticated for the standard tests. And my, does he hate us! Thinks I'm his nemesis... Crawford's very clever, isn't he? Using you.
Mr. Yow, if this door should fall down -ha ha! - or anything else - would you be kind enough to call this number? It's our Baltimore field office. They know you're here with me... Do you understand?
Mr. Gordon, did you take over this place after Mrs. Lippman died?
We're trying to interview all of the serial killers now in custody, for a psychobehavioral profile. Could be a big help in unsolved cases. Most of them have been happy to talk to us. They have a compulsion to boast, these people... Do you spook easily, Starling?
I've read your interim memo on Lecter. You sure you've left nothing out?
Well? Why aren't you there right now?
Miggs has been murdered.
What should I say? You did fine work. We'll wait on the lab.
The other girls are in the ground. Exhumations are upsetting for the families. I'll do it if I have to, but -
You seem pretty sure of that.
Chilton has killed her, hasn't he? That slimy little bastard! We were so close with Lecter - and now her last chance is gone.
I lied to Lecter. I'll need some kind of peace offering... Can I get the drawings from his cell?
Mr. Crawford... can those cops down there handle Dr. Lecter?
Ohio is cold ground. Picked over, ten months ago. Our people worked it, so did the locals.
He's making himself a "woman suit," Mr. Crawford - out of real women! And he can sew, this guy, he's really skilled. A dressmaker, or a tailor -
That's why they're all so big - because he needs a lot of skin! He keeps them alive to starve them awhile - to loosen their skin, so that -
Sir, that's great news. But how -
This Gumb's a real beauty. Slaughtered both his grandparents when he was twelve, and did nine years in juvenile psychiatric. Where, Starling, he took vocational rehab, and learned a useful trade...
They said she was just rags, like somebody -
No way. She had a guy, I'da known, believe me. Sewing was her life, she was really great at it. Poor Freddie.
Doctor, we have a hard problem in psychological profiling. I want to ask for your help with a questionnaire.
I have no doubt of it.
I'm only asking you to look at this, Doctor. Either you will or you won't.
Five... so far.
You see a lot, Dr. Lecter. But are you strong enough to point that high- powered perception at yourself? How about it...? Look at yourself and write down the truth.  Or maybe you're afraid to.
Why don't you ask me about Buffalo Bill?
Jack Crawford is helping your career, isn't he? Apparently he likes you. And you like him, too.
I've been in this room for eight years, Clarice. I know they will never, ever let me out while I'm alive. What I want is a view. I want a window where I can see a tree, or even water. I want to be in a federal institution, away from Chilton - and I want a view. I'll give good value for it. Crawford could do that for me, but he won't. You persuade him.
Yes.
"Plum Island Animal Disease Research Center." Sounds charming.
Quid pro quo, Doctor.
I thought you might want your drawings back... Just until you get your view.
Dr. Lecter, you find out everything. You couldn't have talked with this "William Rubin", even once, and come out knowing so little about him... You made him up, didn't you?
I think you were telling me the truth in Baltimore - or starting to. Tell me the rest now.
Then tell me how.
Where were you going?
You still wake up sometimes, don't you? Wake up in the dark, with the lambs screaming?
Your lambs are still for now, Clarice, but not forever... You'll have to earn it again and again, this blessed silence. Because it's the plight that drives you, and the plight will never end.
Examination and interview materials are confidential. We've never violated an applicant's trust, and we never will.
My God, you've grown up.
Why didn't you bury those people?
He did?
What?!
They're going to hang you.  Why didn't you leave when you had the chance?
What is it?
Where will we go?
My letter...
You do not know what you are saying!
You still have an aversion to the water?
Will you consider that?
One called Magua arrived.
Cora, I adore you and, when we come together, we will be the happiest couple in England...  I am certain of that. More than ever before.  I believe you must trust the judgment of others who hold your welfare so close to their hearts...
beyond the periphery of men, staring at him.
Yes. Go ahead.
What?!
Of course not!  And how is it you were nearby?
It should be enough to remind you France is the enemy.
Really? Do you want them to overrun all New York colony?
You do what you want with your own scalp.  Do not be tellin' us what to do with ours.
I'll cover them from the top of the casement.
Let the children of the dead Colonel Munro go free and take the fire out of the English anger over the murder of their helpless ones.
So the Huron are the servants of the French?  To do what the French are shamed to do?
That judgment is not more important than their right under agreement with Webb to defend their farms & families... Major Heyward was at John Cameron's. He saw what it was.
I didn't experience anything so surprising from Bristol to Albany as what I witnessed here today.
Does Webb not even know we are besieged?
Men are to stay in file, Sergeant Major!
Excuse me. What did you say?
Three, four oxen... much wampum.
What is enough?
Is the hatchet buried between the English and my French father?
Not a warrior has a scalp and the white men become friends.
Magua took the hatchet to color it with blood.  It is still bright. Only when it is red, then it will be buried.
That's where a lead bullet has torn you.
Please accept my compliments for the strong and skillful defense of your fortress. Under the command of a lesser man it would have fallen long ago given the superior numbers and material... mere chance has allowed me to array against you...
Their arms?
My colors?
Dead?  This morning you said he had some skin disorder.
Was there such a thing?
Not exactly a big ocean country.
No, it's not going through. The intercom's busted.  I thought DeJesus fixed that?
Jesus Christ...
No way...
That's an order!
You did good...
Today...with DeJesus.  That was smart thinking to get him inside...
I guess I figured if I was in their shoes that's what I would've done.
We're on backup air.
Less than an hour.  It's ruptured an air duct.
It hit me!  Where are they?!
Something wrong, Cobb?
Charge set?
How do you feel, DeJesus?
Thank you, Martin.
Forty-eight hours!
You take your money, too seriously, Bo.
Cute, DeJesus...Specimen cups?
Yeah?  How'd the kid hold up?
"Routine," my ass!  Ain't nothin' "routine" about no physical check- up 10,000 feet down...especially when we're getting picked up the next day!
At least we get time and a half.  That's in the contract.
You let him get away!
I say we should go get in the escape bubbles and get the hell out of here!
It's Sixpack!
How'd you do that?
Excuse me, sir...Bowman's sick.  She's downstairs in the infirmary.
It would explain the suction- like appendages.
Clear for pickup.
Who were you talking to?
The shack...
Bitch!  Look what you did!
I'll kill him!
Is there something we should know about you, Soap?
When the old bastard is not playing cards he's chasing a thousand debts that ill-fated individuals owe for an array of reasons.
Drachmas, I hope. I would feel safer with a chicken drumstick. They could do more harm than good.
Well?
Well you just better un-sell 'em, sharpish.
You fucking well have to get 'em!
All right, all right, so we can say he is good.
Shotguns? What, like guns that fire shot?
I hate these Southern shites.
The boys had 'em. I know you like these things; wondered if you wanted them?
They were going to pay, then?
Son, have a look in his locker.
It's in an office; I have just left it in the office. 137
OK Gary, we call each other Kenny, all right?
I want you to search the house for bugs. I mean I want you to strip it.
Don't you stags move or I'll kill the lot of ya.
My neck, Dog.  That's the last bag?
Where?
Yeah invitations, you know a pretty white piece of paper with your name on it.
Well, what do you want us to do about it?
What the hell are you doing here?
You must be Eddy. JD's son.
It's pay day, ain't it?
And?
No, I'm afraid he's not. He's out at the moment.
Sorry, got to do business like this now; can't be too careful these days.
What are you doing, Plank?
And that does include the amp?
Jews don't celebrate Christmas, Tom.
Bloody hell, Tom! This is a bit heavy. This is London, not the Lebanon' Who do you think I am?
Of course you will look mean, Tom, you will look really scary.
Well Jesus, that wasn't so bad, was it?
There's six black cocks sitting on the side of the road. How many beaks have they got between them?
How many wings have they got between them?
Chill, Winston, it's me and Charlie can see it's me, so what's the problem?
You jerk--
I'm only going to have you for two more years. If you decide not to go on to college--
When you were given the opportunity to enlist, a kind of contract was agreed upon. I think the Army has honored its part of that agreement.
Please.
Do you think you've been discriminated against on this post?
So you knew this young man before?
And you and Private Graves--
Report to Dr. Innis at the clinic.
You and one hundred nineteen other fortunate individuals. Put it in gear.
Sam the Man.
Charley Wade.
You ever shoot anybody was looking you in the eye?
Whole different story; isn't it?
There's not a soul in this county isn't sick to death of your bullshit, Charley. You made yourself scarce, you could make a lot of people happy.
The Longhorns gonna kick some serious butt this Saturday, you just watch. We got a kid at tailback from down your way--outta El Indio--
Oh. Right. And you're in--?
Same weight I always was.
My mother said he never asked about--
He was part of the Seminole Nation, got pushed down into the Everglades in pioneer days. African people who run off from the slaveholders hooked up with them, married up, had children. When the Spanish give up Florida, the U.S.Army come down to move all them Indian peoples off to Oklahoma--
Men worked for Santa Anna down there, waited out the Civil War. The land wasn't much to feed people on, so in 1870 they come north and put up at Fort Duncan and the men joined up what was called the Seminole Negro Indian Scouts. Best trackers either side of the border. Bandits, rustlers, Texas rednecks, Kiowa, Comanche--
They were in the Army. Like your father.
So I'm part-Indian?
Otis Payne was never embarrassed about a thing in his life.
Cliff--
Since I've been stationed here? A fistfight now and then--
Guy cracks walnuts with his asshole.
You met her family? They gonna be cool about you being a white guy?
This is the stuff we picked up the other day, right? The rest of this is all .30 caliber--
So where does that put us?
They stopped training infantry there in the late '50s. It was just a playground for the jackrabbits till they gave it to the county last year.
Well, yeah, but I went through the Program. I haven't had a drink since--
Black Seminoles?
You get much of that in here?
This here's Carolyn. Honey, this is my son, Delmore.
I gonna meet that family of yours?
Hola, amgio. Problemas de llanta? [Hey, friend. Tire problems?]
I haven't seen anybody doing that.
Reputation?
This girl has a child?
Sam! I was just telling a few about your old man.
They just wanted it to be one of theirs--
Charley Wade were known to have put a good number of people in the ground, and your daddy gets eyeball to eyeball with him.
Your mother was a saint.
When we backed you--
I heard there was a bit of a fuss.
Floating around out here, playin' hell with them bass--play a little cards, play a little golf, drink some beer--
No.
Was it Davy Crockett or Jim Bowie?
He still living?
And Buddy was one of them.
Charley Wade.
We're building up tourism, Sam--
He agreed it wasn't exactly news--
There isn't money allocated for that. But a jail--
Steve called for you.
Steve. Board of Education Steve who likes you? He goes for us hot-blooded Mexican girls, I can tell.
The old-high-school-heartthrob Sheriff. I thought you were crazy about each other. He's available, you're available--
Did you come here to tell me how to run my business?
Nobody's too busy.
And my father?
I could name five girls at school who have one just like it--
Morning, Sheriff.
Three months.
Your father never bothered me about it. Leastways not till the drug people got on his back in the late '60s.
That's how I ruined my stomach.
Something wrong?
Got him here?
I was--I was real sorry about Nando. He was a good fella. We haven't talked since.
Your mother still doesn't like me.
Nice-looking kid.
You have any idea when your father died? Eladio?
I've never seen my mother in a bathing suit before.  Didn't know she owned one.
Down from Houston. I think he knew the girl before.
How 'bout you?
Excellent performance, my friend. The judge was very impressed.
You're the one who's a good boy. Man say "fetch" and you fetch--
We'll get 'em--  So you livin' out here now?
One of Cleroe Payne's boys?
It's supposed to be some big sin, even if you love each other.
Mister D'Amour?
Hello, L.A.
Why?
I could have lost my fucking hands.
That's because he knew.  He'd seen these files and knew.
Hokey enough for you?
Right.
I saw him on T.V.  Some kid got possessed and he saved the little bastard's life.
Don't.
Do you wish him to be amongst us?
We haven't slept in the same bed for years.
You don't believe me.
Will you take the job, Mr. D'Amour?
I can be very persuasive.
Just curious.  Back to business.  Ever heard of a man called Nix?  Dorothea?
Flesh is a trap.  That's what he used to say.  Flesh is a trap and magic sets us free.  Why did you come back?
What did you find?
Nix ran some kind of cult, right? Some kind of Charlie Manson deal?
Harry?
Don't look.
Is it finished?
What the fuck?
Valentin?
... they believe you.
What were you doing up there?
And this Butterfield guy--
I'm not saying another word.  You damn fool.  He's a journalist.
With what?
Great accent, by the way.  Is it Brooklyn?
Whatever I said, I didn't mean it, okay?  I get a few drinks inside me --
Havanas.  You're not the smoker.  So who is?
Any movie stars buried here?
Are you sure?
Who is she?
Jennifer's been with us four years. She was coming on nicely. But just the last month or so, she's worse than ever.
Hold on.
You know Vinovich?
Are they all in the business?
A lot of people are going to be really pissed off when they discover you're still alive.
I don't think so.  You need me alive.
Or murdered, like Nix.
Maybe he doesn't see it that way. Maybe he's digging his way out of the hole you put him right now.  That's what you're hiding away from, isn't it?
And she shot him I  I think that'd piss me off if I were Nix.
Oh Jeez.
He had something.  He showed me how to bend the rules.  A little levitation.  A few fireworks.
Did she know where Nix was buried?
Who else did?  Did Valentin?
They got here before us.
That's where we're all going.
You never took a fucking vacation in your life, Harry. What's going on?
Yeah.  But not as cheap.  Call me.
Hello?
Ok.
Yes... I don't know, I don't know her anymore. I don't know if you can be in love with one person the whole time. I was... actually I was in love with her sister first, when I was twenty-one. And one day her sister said to me she wanted to move to Paris, so I said okay, and she said no, she wanted to move to Paris with Francois,   and she's still married to him. And I moved in with Lydia... but I always really liked Lydia.
What do you do?
What did you study?
Not really. How long are you here for?
Charlotte, who?
Really?
I don't remember.
Why do they switch the r's and l's here?
Yeah? But look at you.
That's nice. My parents were always traveling, they weren't around so much.
You are.
It's for my daughter.
Four.
You can't get sushi anywhere in Japan after 2 o'clock. Did you know that?
Well, I guess she's more around your age...  You guys could talk about things in common, like growing up in the fifties.
Why can't it last?
Just saying good-bye to everyone before you leave?
Well... have a good flight.
I don't know... I want to be more healthy. I want to eat better.
Not all that pasta.
Oh, come on.
Hello?
I couldn't hear you. How are you?
When are you coming home?
Hello?
I gotta go meet Kelly for a drink downstairs. She wants to talk about some photo thing.
You smell weird.
Hair stuff?
Will you please stop smoking?
Are you sure you want to stay?
Yeah, I know you have to work the whole time, I'll probably have more fun here. I'll call Charlie and those guys.
Lauren?
John! What are you doing here?
Uh..thanks.
I missed you.
You never said anything to me...
Weird.  The book again.  Sex spelled backwards...
Hey, what are you doing here in the middle of the day?
I spaced out.
Yeah, I appreciate it.  Thanks, Josef.
You're glad somebody tried to kill me?
Yeah, like...
I'm just temporarily off my game.
You know, I made a reservation at Marco's for Peter's birthday dinner, but maybe you should cater it.
Yes.
Father Jeremy and Deacon John Townsend of St. Ursula's, and our associate, Maya Larkin.  Secular assistants are permitted if regarded as qualified.  Maya is eminently qualified.
There is a medical explanation for everything that happened.
You'll do it?
How're you doing?  Looking lovely as always.
Between your book sales and this TV thing, there's going to be no living with you.  And let me guess, you boiled God down to a conceit.
You fucking bastard.
You raised me, like a son.
You killed my parents.
Why are you doing this to me?
Father!  Thank God you're better!  I really need your help.  We've only got a few more hours.
So, if Christ won, that means, what does that mean, Father?  That Satan...
Father, please don't die.
Well I know he's come here before.
Two negatives always make a positive.
Last night a guy named John Townsend tried to shoot me and now I find out you knew him.  What the fuck is going on?
Why did he try to kill me?
Why didn't Birdson just say so?
You should think about getting professional help.
Peter, your blood-type is AB negative. There's no way your birth father can be O positive.  You father is not who you think he is.
When Townsend tried to kill me, he said something strange like...  "The time of transformation is near..."
Peter, let go of the chair!
There's nothing else here.
Why didn't you just go along with Townsend.  Get rid of me.  I would've...
I don't know.  Extra apartment keys. What's it matter?
What can I do?
He was trying to tell me something.
Book five, Deuteronomy, chapter seven, verse five.  "But this shall you deal with them.  You shall break down their altars and burn their graven images with fire."
A lot of good that'll do.
I'd appreciate it if you'd put that back.
The police used him as a witness in this case.
Good of you to stop by.
Peter, you're now writing a book about the Viznick case.  You seem to be making a career of studying sensational murderers.  I have to ask, how does it make you feel when you sit in courtrooms day after day, face to face with alleged killers?
Seems George isn't making too many friends in lockup.
He could see me.
What's up?
Yeah.  Can't wait to see him  I just saw Quincy.
Yeah, you met her?
That's not it.
Which one for tomorrow?
When you're done can you make sure she brushes her teeth?
...we moved back here when Quincy was about five, after Zeke was traded. Neighborhood was a little more mixed back then...
Oh, me too.  I used to cook for my friends' parties and things back in Atlanta.
You could've given up after you threw that ball away.  But you kept your head and you showed real heart.
What?
Sorry.
My mouth is kinda dry.
Wait...
Quincy, word has it you might make the jump the NBA.
Hello.
I don't wanna see that.
Nah.
I don't know sometimes.
Mom's going to hate it.
No.
I don't know how to walk in heels.
I know.  But chances are...
Coach hates me, doesn't she?
What's up?
I know.
What's that?
Yeah, four years ago.  They had me staying in this tiny-ass town with like fifty people.  I'm not playing, there was about a thousand goats running around, and it gets dark at four o'clock.  Then the whack club I'm on loses three games in a row and I get blamed.  So they fire me.
What?  You've been over here seven months and you ain't tapped anything?
You ever think about going back?
One, up.
For real?
So how come you could play basketball?
I never knew a girl that could play.
What do I have to do?
I don't have to do what you say.
What's that?
Why she gotta be a ho, just cause she wants to get with me.
And?
So she's honest.
That's it, give it your best shot.
Please, you jump in some guy's face, talk smack and you get a pat on your ass.  But because I'm a female, I get told to calm down and act like a "lady".  I'm a ballplayer, okay.  A ball player.
You don't look half-bad.
Hey.
You having fun?
Yeah, the DJ's kinda whack, though.  So who is this clown?
Why?
What was that about?
I can't help girls coming up to me.
It's okay, little baby.
Kiss my booty.
Don't put your hands in your pockets, hold your head up, always look a man in the eye, and all the time I'm hanging on his every word like he's God or something...
I...can't.
Hey.
Yeah, I hit a three at the buzzer.
Stay!
You're what?
So...I guess I'll see you around.
I'm tired of playing overseas.  Thinking about giving it a rest for awhile.
So...how's the knee?
It just isn't.
You're serious.
I mean, Kyra hasn't heard the school thing yet.  She'll probably say it's the painkillers talking.
So why'd you give up ball?
Cause I don't get it.
You just got back from a four game road trip.
What is this?
Where's your dad?
Why not?
Your mom got pregnant and I had to make choices.  You don't have a choice.
Besides, the sooner you go pro, the sooner you'll have to deal with the mess I'm dealing with.
Some girl that's been hanging on at every party.  now I'm supposed to be her baby's Daddy.  Anyway, I told your mom I wanted to be the one who told you.
Sorry.
Why?
Don, you got hit by lightning that time in Tahoe, you went on vacation, I don't think braces is a good idea --
You smell like trouble --
Well I don't want to order anything, you see. I have a situation, a situation just come up that's really pretty serious and I'm not sure who I should talk to or what I should do but could you maybe put me in touch with the right person if I explain myself?
Uh-huh.
My mother had breast cancer.
It was scary though.
Thank you, Chad, and good luck to you and your mother --
I don't wanna talk to you.
Why are you here, why are you doing this? Coming in here -- you wanna call me a whore?
Get out of here, get the fuck out of my house --
FUCK YOU.  FUCK YOU, YOU GET OUT.
FUCK YOU.  YOU GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.
Please put your clothes on, please --
Honey.
Your mother wants to hear from you --
OPEN THE DOOR.
...yeah...
Yes.
What?
No.
got some coffee brewing, huh?
Many times, in damestic abuse situations the young lady is afraid to speak, but I have to tell you that, being a police officer, I've seen it happen: Young woman afraid to speak, next thing you know, I'm gettin' a call on the radio, I got a 422 --
Just Jim.
No, no.  I was wondering...man oh man. I think I feel like a bit of a scum-bucket doing this, considering that I came here as an officer of the law and the situation and all this but I think I'd be a fool if I didn't do something I really want to do which is to ask you on a date.
Eight o'clock?
Oh sure yes, that's fine, late dinners are good.  Should I get dressed up or -- ?
Billingsley's?
It's my favorite place --
Did you ever go out with someone and just....lie....question after question, maybe you're trying to make yourself look cool or better than you are or whatever, or smarter or cooler and you just -- not really lie, but maybe you just don't say everything --
To not do that.  To not do that that we've maybe done -- before --
You really use strong language.
-- no, no, it's fine. Fine.
I'm gonna run to the bathroom for a minute...maybe just --
Well.
I haven't been on a date since I was married and that was three years ago....and Claudia...whatever you wanna tell me, whatever you think might scare me, won't...and I will listen...I will be a good listener to you if that's what you want...and you know, you know...I won't judge you.... I can do that sometimes, I know, but I won't...I can...listen to you and you shouldn't be scared of scaring me off or anything that you might think I'll think or on and on and just say it and I'll listen to you....
I'll take everything at face value. I'll be a good listener to you.
You live alone?
Hello.  You're back again, huh?
-- can I get you?
Diet Coke.
I'm fine. Yes. I'm fine.
Where's Richard and Julia?
Where's the news department at this studio?
Have you ever been there?
I'm wondering about the weather department. I'm wonderin' wether or not the weather people use outside meteorlogical services or if they have in-house instruments?
GIVE US YOUR MONEY.
Put me on the payroll, find out, find out wassup --
You wanna take my statement, I'll perform for you, gotta get paid though, gotta get PAID.
No school today.  My teacher got sick.
Are you a joker? huh? Tellin' jokes?
Oh, you're a rapper, huh?  You got a record contract?
Hey. Watch the mouth. Watch it.
Check that ego - come off it - I'm the profit - the proffesor Ima teach you 'bout The Worm, who eventually turned to catch wreck with the neck of a long time oppressor And he's runnin from the devil, but the debt is always gaining And if he's worth being hurt, he's worth bringin' pain in - When the sunshine don't work, the Good Lord bring the rain in.
Doc it's Janet.
I have to talk to Frank, is he nearby?
I have love.
But you're alright now, so what's the what?
That's right.
It was the lovely Samuel Johnson who also spoke of a fella "Who was not only dull but a cause of dullness in others."
Brad, I know you don't love me now --
This is so fucked, Solomon. I don't deserve this.
And how much is braces?
I just, I just -- I just -- I'm just in a fucking state, I know he's going and it's like I don't know how -- just tell me <u>practical</u> things -- What the fuck do I do with his body? What happens when he dies? That next moment: What? What do I do?  Then What?
...no...no goddamn use.  I have a son, y'know?
....I dunn...o....maybe ten...five, fuck, fuck....that's another thing that goes --
...cocksucker....
...I can't hold onto this anymore...
I wanna see this...where is he, do you know?
She had cancer...from her...in her stomach and I didn't go anywhere with her...and I didn't do a god thing... for her and to help her....shit...this bitch...the beautiful, beautiful bitch with perfect skin and child bearing hips and so soft...her namewasLilysee?  He liked her though he did, his mom, Frank/Jack...he took care of her and she died. She didn't stick with him and he thinks and he hates me, ok...see...I'm...that's then what you get? ....are you still walkin' in that car...?
She does.  From when you were a boy.
And you went to Van Nuys High, right?
Where does that name come from?
Hello.  Frank.  Frank TJ Mackey.
He's in here.
How long have you taken care of him?
How long...you think?
I've heard your tapes on the phone.
You're just come in --
You don't tell me, I know my rights, just come right in, you can't --
I AM CALM.
You're here.
I preffer to stand.
I don't know a loud crash.
You just woke up.  And what'd you have a party last night, the way this place looks?
No. No. Stay down, Marcie, sit back down on that couch --
This is the LAPD, if anyone is in the closet I want you to come out and show yourself to me, slowly and with your hands up --
No.
It's just...too late for me to be fuckin' around.  I gotta stop. I gotta clean my brain of all the shit I've done that I shouldn't have done --
Thirty fuckin' years I've been with Rose, don't -- y'know -- with this, and I know what you think --
What happend to you?
We're on the air in twenty minutes, Jimmy.
I can't fuckin' do this.
You're my handsome man.
No.  No.
No.
Two years...three years...
I love you so much.
Why doesn't Claudia talk to you, Jimmy?
...Jimmy...
You're Jimmy Gator, right?
Was it a call back?
We're not going out two days before we set the record, it's not gonna happen.
You should get one, I'm serious, you could get a lot of stuff out of this --
You have to go, Stanley.  You're the smartest.
You don't want any water?
I don't want him to die, I didn't love him when we met, and I've done so many bad things to him that he doesn't know, things I want to confess to him, but now I do: I love him. I love him so much and I can't stand -- he's going.
Where will the money go?
What does that mean?
You don't do that, you don't call him, you don't know to get involved in the bussiness of his, of his of <u>my</u> family. this is the <u>family</u>, <u>me</u> and <u>him</u> do you understand?  You understand? NO ONE ELSE. THERE IS NO ONE ELSE.  That man, his son does not exist.  HE IS DEAD.  HE IS DEAD and WHO TOLD YOU TO DO THAT?
Cats and Dogs out there, huh?
Pink Dot.
mmm.hmm.
Total is $15.29.  Thirty minutes or less.
Stanley if you don't fuckin' stand up and go over there I'm gonna beat your ass --
I got an audition, I won't make it here 'till two, c'mon, I'll see you later. Love you.
C'mon, man.
What's the problem, what's the problem here?
I didn't I'm fine, I'm fine.
Hi.
...fuck you mean, it's raining frogs?
Oh God I -- Forgive me...
What -- ?
My Queen...
I am King, Mother!  And I do not wish to discuss this with you.
D'Artagnan, you will hunt down Aramis, Porthos and Athos, and bring me their heads, or I will have yours.  And as for you, Phillippe... Back to the prison you shall go, and into the mask you hate.
How can I serve you in this?
Your Majesty...
And some problems cannot be settled without one.
What do you propose to do?
Tonight!  Right now!  We steal a man from a royal prison, we hide in a country chateau among an assortment of saints and sluts such as only you could provide, and still you wish to tell me nothing?!
Physical resemblance is but one small thing!  Louis has an arrogance, a manner --
You can do it.
But Aramis -- !  Phillippe can learn in time, but --
Look at us.  We are old men now.  But once we were young.  And when we saw injustice, we fought it.
I cannot betray Louis.  I will defend him with my life.
I just said you're praying!  Are you deaf too?  I know you're blind, because if you had seen the tits that just walked out of here, you'd have tears in your eyes.
Mother of God!
But -- doesn't God ordain both Pope and King?
And why are you so glum?
Aramis!  Athos!  He looks exactly like... exactly like...
You've been moping for months.  Now that you've gotten the idea of killing yourself out of the way, you can stop boring me and start being useful to me.  Now get some rest.
But what if something extraordinary happened?  Something so unusual that all the attention went to someone else?  Someone whose confirmation of Phillippe the King would never be questioned.
I care only about Michelle.  Should I ask her when we first arrive? Or... or when we're leaving?  I could ask her in the carriage -- but it is more romantic at the palace. I get so confused...
This cannot be.  Everyone knows the Queen Mother is a recluse, and the ladies-in-waiting are but mistresses for the king!
You knew this was happening.  You knew and that's why you came.
I will also speak with the King, for he is surely unaware of the problems his invitation to Mademoiselle Beaufort has caused.
Athos, please...!
Why do you follow him, d'Artagnan?! I know you have put service above your own life, but why does this King deserve such loyalty?  He is a monster!  He executes ministers for his own blunders, with their families hostage so they take the blame!  He has no honor!
The desire for vengeance... can be a poison.
These rooms are yours.  Up these stairs -- or through this hidden passage -- is the room of your mistress... Michelle.
The room of the King's favorite mistress?
Phillippe...?
Aaa!  D'Artagnan!  These passages were constructed for the King's security, not so you could step from my father's portrait and startle me to death!
A personal nature?
That is my desire, and my desire is what should concern you, not the sentiments of some commoner!
Your Majesty.  This ball, with an open invitation to the nobility of Paris -- we have no way of checking --
Your Majesty...?
I -- I thought he was but... an impostor who resembled --
Wait.  Bargain me to Louis, for all your lives.  You have done your best.  Let me go, and let all of you find peace.
You dead yet?
Now.  Where is d'Artagnan?
You are beautiful.  You know you are.
Our agency monitors all threats very carefully, and there's good reason to believe Jim Trudell has the training, the connections, and the experience to present a clear threat to the public if he remains at large.
He walked in on Fleming and took him out.
So what is they have enough to shut us down!
I'm going to look for him on my own. Fuck this.
Don't take any chances.  Call for back-up this time!
Did you hit him?
Let's roll -
If you can trail him to a remote area do it. We all want a piece of him but let's keep our heads and stay within the law - we got people everywhere out here.
Outside hacker?  What the fuck are you talking about?
So...  to get the car back, you break into her house.
Where up north?
No...
Mind if I turn out the light?
You know, you don't seem afraid of much either.  How do you know I'm not going to try to rape you?
What exactly did you see?
And what did you do?
I didn't know what to do - but I knew I had something somebody would want.  That's where I met him - told him what I had.  The FBI set me up with a new place...but the cops found me somehow.  So I ran...and met you.
You are drunk.  You know, it's been a long time and I'd love to catch up, but I really got to -
Operator, I'd like to make a collect call - 213-467-0972...
And?...
I've got a better idea...
You know this time, there's nobody that's gonna cover your ass. You're over your head this time.
That was her - the girl... We have to go.
Where are you going?
I'm stranded out here.
Where did you learn to fight like that? JIM  I read a book.
What would your - boyfriend - think?
No - that's not it!  She said her boyfriend stranded her up there! I didn't ask her to come with me!
Where am I going?
Don't you guys ever knock?
Oh yeah?  You're a smart man?...
What about him?
How long do I have?
Willingham, when he tossed his cell, took Polaroids so they could get everything back in place...
Where?
This is Chester here. Who am I talking to?
'Dear Pilgrim, you honor me.'
You're his friend, Jack. Why can't you leave him alone?
He thinks you want him to look at evidence.
I should have caught you at the boat yard when you got off work. You don't want to talk about it here...
Blond, right-handed, really strong, wears a size eleven shoe. The prints are all smooth gloves. He's on a full moon cycle. Both times. His blood is AB Positive.
If you can't look anymore, I understand...
Let's talk after dinner. Stay and eat.
He is good. Bur not as good as Price.
Atlanta and Birmingham can run the thumb print against known sex offenders. Five will get you ten they don't come up with an identification. Jimmie may in the Finder program... if he's ever been printed and in his Index.
Don't expect too much from me, Jack, all right?  We'll get him one way or the other.
For Christ's sake, why?
Sarah, order a chopper. I want the next thing smoking and I don't care whose. Ours. DCPD.  Or the Marines. Then call Documents. Tell them to scramble a team. I want everybody moving in five minutes.  Dr. Chilton, please do not handle the note. I have a Documents team on the way to you by helicopter to pick it up.
Twenty-five minutes. We won't make it in time.
What'd it say?
He changes them into beings that accept him... And he needs to see the acceptance, In the mirrors.  I didn't understand the mirrors before.  It's very important.
It's a word. Killing them...  His delusion is: if he sees himself accepted enough times, he will become as one who has the power to be accepted all the time.  And he would record it somehow. So he can see himself received over and over again...
It's getting late and...
Will...?
I'll cover the back.
...but if we find him, the print as evidence will get a conviction, Hold on. What?
Ms. McClain, I'm Francis Dollarhyde. I came about the low light level infrared film stock.
I'll take you.
How did you come to Gateway?
I'll see you later. All right?
Who?
Am I alone in this room? Are you here...  Why are you doing this?!
Two groups of people were changed. Leeds and Jacobi. The police think they were murdered.  Do you know what they call the being that visited these people?  You can say.
Are you cold? Would you like a blanket?
Do you know who I am, Mr. Lounds?
Do you feel privileged?
Do you believe God is in attendance here, Mr. Lounds?
Freddie Lounds. Your photograph. Do you see?
Are you a man?
Now you will read this into the tape recorder.
You will tell the truth?
Come in.
Dr. Lecktor will stay in his room. That is absolutely the only place where he is not put in full body restraints. One wall of his room is a double barrier. I will have a chair put just outside.
I want to see Lecktor now.
Linda doesn't come in nights.
She'll be in, in the morning...
Yeah...
This is Will Graham. Can I help you?
He's misunderstood.
That's all we know about.  Most of the time in sex assaults the bite mark has a livid spot in the center. A suck mark. These don't. So, for him, biting may be a fighting pattern as much as sexual behavior.  You could try emergency room personnel, treatment for bite wounds. I know that's pretty thin...  He bites a lot.
What happened to them?
To yourself...
No.
You mended a crack in the wallpaper with your diploma.  You are open and easy now... It took you a lot of work to get to that...
If I were?
Hello, hotshot!
Which part? That or the day-to-day.
Yellow's a bad color for me.  I'll look green at breakfast.
Blue is cold.
Can you quit?
And... where are things?
What will you do?
Is Crawford going with you?
Come home with me.
Small difference: I'm not dead, yet.
What do you want?
Is there anything I need to know to see about Mom?
Barry's mom had this newspaper. It said you killed the guy in Minnesota and were in a mental hospital. Is it true?
How did it happen?
You went in the apartment?
Did the girl die?
She got all right?
And Hobbs died?
And?
Yes.
Chilton? Gruesome, isn't he? He fumbles at your head like a freshman pulling at a panty girdle.  He actually tries to give me a Thematic and Apperception test. Hah. Sat there waiting for MF-13 to come up. It's a card with a woman in bed and a man in the foreground.  I was supposed to avoid a sexual interpretation. I laughed in his face.  Never mind, it's boring.
Let me have them, and I might consider it.
It's not 'interesting'. You thought of it before.
I don't have one right now.
No.
You know Lounds's enlightened me on one thing: your confinement in the mental hospital. My attorney should have brought that our in court.
Because he's gone for the head shot seven out of eight times'
People love... comedians.
No.
They're IMPOSSIBLE!!  Jesus!  I mean -- "two guaranteed guest shots for Tony Clifton"??!  Who is this TONY CLIFTON?!
Look, I'm sorry.  They're assholes! But we work in a creative business. You can't predict what people are gonna like --
Tell you what.  I'll book you on some concerts, and meanwhile, we'll show the Special around... see if somebody wants to buy it --
I'm sorry, George...
They're having a laugh...
Maybe I can turn it into a bit.  I can go back on the show, and say it was rigged.  Demand a recount...
Did your -- doctor say it's okay for you to go back to work?
So, Mr. Besserman, same slot tomorrow...?
What do you want?  "Take my wife, please"??
But I've got a sports show. Championship wrestling, at five.
Andrew -- HOW DARE YOU!!  For all we knew, you were DYING!  Look at your mother -- she's still shaking!
Five.
What are you talking about?!  We just met an hour ago.
Hey, I hope you didn't take that stuff I said seriously.  It was just part of the show!  It's like the old days, when a carnival barker would try to rile up the crowd.
Hi...
Popcorn?
Popcorn?
Andy, the theater's that way!
Ooo, the little lady's upset.  Well I say -- get back in the kitchen!
Then stop treating me like a fucking prop.
Go away.
I brought you Haagen Dazs. Chocolate.
You're NOT DYING!
I'm not comfortable with the last sketch.  I DON'T do drug humor!
It's so dirty.
Hey -- that stuff gets written-up in the papers --
"Philosophically"?
It's probably just a strained muscle.
No, I'm serious.  If you book Tony, do NOT EXPECT TO GET ANDY.
Uh, yeah.  Is this GEORGE SHAPIRO?
So you've got this big elaborate joke, which is really only funny to two people in the universe.  You... and you.
I saw Michael!
What's in Memphis?
He'll be contacting us again.
Smith.  I am Agent Smith.
You're two hours late.
You weren't supposed to relieve me.
Did you hear that?
There's something about him, isn't there?
I'm tired, Trinity.  I'm tired of this war, I'm tired of fighting. I'm tired of this ship, of being cold, of eating the same fucking goop every day.  But most of all, I'm tired of this jagoff and all of his bullshit.
Yes.  You see, the truth is, Trinity, that we humans have a place in the future.  But it's not here. It's in the Matrix.
No, it's all right.
Thanks... for the drink.
I got a fibrillation!
Morpheus...
Holy fucking shit!
The cubicle across from you is empty.
No!  It's too far away.
Welcome, Neo.  As you no doubt have guessed, I am Morpheus.
Morpheus, what's happened to me? What is this place?
No!  I don't believe it!  It's not possible!
How did I beat you?
I thought it wasn't real.
This is another Matrix simulation. A training program to help you get your sea legs and teach you one very important lesson.
So is this the same oracle that made the, uh, prophecy?
And she knows what?  Everything?
And she's never wrong.
I told you I don't believe in this stuff.  No matter what she says I'm not going to believe it, so what's the point?
We need an exit.
Sorry, kid.  You got the gift but looks like you're waiting for something.
That was a long time ago.
What the hell is this?!
What does that mean?
But an Oracle can.
Are you all right?
Goddamnit!  Goddamnit!
Are you all right?
Morning.  Did you sleep?
It's a city?
Holy shit!
See who?
How much time?
Why?
Operator.
We need an exit!
There is.  We have to pull the plug.
Operator.
Sssh!  Quiet.  Y'know that's illegal.
Yeah.
See what I mean?  A question please...'Is this what you call living?'
And I wouldn't call it TONY'S PLACE or CHARLIE'S PLACE...  I'd call it something like SEASON OF THE WITCH... get it?
May God be with you.
'Art thou the King of the Jews'?
Listen, I appreciate it, but I'll handle it myself.  I'll write.
Hey...no more good times like before.  Until you come back.
I know but let's hear it anyway.
Nah.
Yes, you're gettin' it all over my tie.
You sick or what?  You forget what we had to do to get you on the trucks, stupid?
You're not supposed to like it. What gets me is your attitude. Listen... tomorrow you show up.
Keep your mouth shut.
I think we should see your uncle.
What are you going to do?  Hide me?
I can't make this week's payment and if this keeps up not next week's either.
Look...I don't know.  What am I supposed to be, his keeper or something?  Yeah, he's supposed to be here but who knows what goes on in his head.  Right?
...Charlie, don't you think you should be interested in Johnny's payments to me?  I think you should be, you know that.
Look...I've talked to him and I've talked to him...what more can I do...?  Tonight at the party all three of us get together and we knock some sense into his head...ok?
What's a'matter?
He could at least show some respect and show his face, even if he doesn't have the money...
I was thinking maybe you'd do very nicely for the place.
Yeah, you know...you greet the people...see them to their tables... well...it'll be different though... Listen...why don't we get together and talk after your show tonight.
Ok.  Chinese.  We'll meet on the corner of 6th Avenue and Waverly Place after you finish.
About that shooting last night...I was there and...
Take a drink!
I really couldn't believe it when you told me, you know that?
"Francis Macomber."
"Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber."
It's only a couple of courses...just for the draft.
Why don't you take a look around the place if you want?
Sure...it's not that...I mean...
...He must have heard the name from those T.V.'s in the hall that were blaring all the time.  I remember GUEVARA was in town at the time. Must've heard it from there I guess...but that's funny, isn't it?
Teresa?...Yeah, Charlie.  Listen, I'm looking for your cousin.  Yeah, well today's Tuesday, payday.  I haven't seen him all day...no...well, have you got any idea where he is?  I know it's early yet but I'm just getting worried that's all...
Don't count it...it's all there.
Put it on the little tab so that it balances with the big one.
You mean it's heisted.
How about me?  I don't get a drink John?
I know what you're going to say but don't say it.  These drinks are all on the tab.  I'm gonna see you this Tuesday payday, I promise.  I give you my word.
Must have been all the liquor in him.
I'm Allison, you're 'honey'.
Dinner?  Again?
Daddy!
Isn't it enough to be on this earth sixty-five years without having to be reminded of it.
Now, I'm getting interested.  I want to know more ---
From the Korean War.
What is this?
Oh, the goddam party --
Hi, Daddy, what do you think?
What about the Mayor?
Paillarde of veal.
I would prefer some peanut butter.
Incidentally, Joe, where're you staying?
It's just a saying, Mr. Black,
It doesn't matter.
Is this a state secret or are we being excluded just for the fun of it?
In my sleep.
'Yes'.
Sorry...um - you - you know it's gone right out of my head --
'Joe...'
No.
Joe, cut it out.  And you too, Drew.
You're competitive soul, Drew. That's what makes you a great addi- tion to the money.  Joe is just... around.
Mind if I throw up?
What is there to say?  They know what John Bontecou is -- and if they didn't, they know now.
What do you think the Board is going to say when I tell them that?
Whose?
Did you want to have a cup of coffee or something, Bill?
I think I'd like to talk to my lawyer --
And what do I get?
You're talking through your hat. You're offering a deal because you've got no proof.
He was interested.
What have you done?  You've gotten the old man fired!
I'm going to put a stop to this!
Obeah.
Doctor lady make it irey.
Not time yet.
Oh, you come to see Doctor Lady?
My Doctor Lady?
Yah.
I am.
Good morning, Mr. Parrish.
How long you here, Joe?
You're an original, Joe.  A little hard to figure, maybe...
What are you doing here?
-- Can't seem to escape you today.
I came to see you.
I wanted to apologize, Susan --
Why do you love peanut butter so much?
I'm very concerned about the woman you attended to today.
Where are you going?
Well...I'm -- uh, Joe.  And you're Susan.  And I - uh - have this weak feeling in my knees --
I just thought I'd drop by, scrounge a little lunch, I was in the neigh- borhood --
Did you like making love to me?
For how long?
Well -- I --
Will it?
Did I say that?
...I just saw my doctor, he told me everything was fine.
-- I don't deserve this.  I'm still young, this is not my time --
I want to live.
Would you like to sit down, Joe?
Excellent.  What is it?
Dinner?  Absolutely.
Why, at this juncture, are you letting yourself be so concerned by business matters?
Okay.
You were just curious?
About Susan?
Okay.  Goodnight.
What 'okay' is, it's 'okay' it's over.  We've got bigger fish to fry, don't we, Joe?
I'm not hungry.
What the hell do you care?
I'm sorry, Bill --
Then what is it?
Okay.
Joe, don't do this --
Happy Birthday, Bill.
Not exactly.
Where are you?
About what?
'The one' to do what?
What the hell are you talking about?
I am, this is it.  B Day.
But I've got to tell you, if mergers are in the wild, I've got some great prospects I've developed.  I want to talk to you about them next week.
Why don't we let it rest for the moment?  Give it some air?
Eddie?
I don't like to interfere.
...There's a start for a meeting.
Listen, I'm crazy about the guy -- He's smart, he's aggressive, he could carry Parrish Communications into the 21st century and me along with it.
I know it's a cornball thing but love is passion, obsession, someone you can't live without.  If you don't start with that, what are you going to end up with?  I say fall head over heels.  Find someone you can love like crazy and who'll love you the same way back.  And how do you find him?  Forget your head and listen to your heart.  I'm not hearing any heart.  Run the risk, if you get hurt, you'll come back.  Because, the truth is there is no sense living your life without this.  To make the journey and not fall deeply in love -- well, you haven't lived a life at all. You have to try.  Because if you haven't tried, you haven't lived.
Are you okay?
Uh - will that hold you, Joe?
Funny, I don't get that feeling. Maybe it's because you found out I'm Bill Parrish's daughter.
That was wonderful.
What is the nature of your interest in Joe?
I don't think this is the lightning you are looking for.  Drew's a good man.  I know I didn't seem to be completely in his corner before, but I've come to appreciate --
Where's Joe?
Daddy --
I love you, Daddy --
I've got patients coming in --
...It's kind of a pro bono job.
I've got to go --
Why?
Amnesia?
What makes you think he's my friend?
This was your room. You're up in 304 now.
Business is slow. I told my boss about You, about your condition. He told me to Try and rent you another room.
You don't have to be that honest, Burt.
I know you said you didn't want any calls...
Do you remember me?
You're making a big fucking mistake. My associates are not people you want -
It's isolated.
Guess I don't have to worry about him anymore.
Calm down. You're not into anything. It was my problem, you offered no help. It's got nothing to do with your investigation.
You decided to help me. Trust yourself. Trust your own judgment. You can question everything, you can never know anything for sure.
His name was Jimmy.
He didn't believe me. He said that if I don't get him the money tomorrow he's gonna kill me. Then he started hitting me.
What are you gonna do?
My wife used to call me Lenny.
Yeah, I hated it.
Don't talk about my wife.
Calm down.
Just take it easy, this isn't my fault.
My wife.
There's a dress code?
How can you read that again?
You've read it a hundred times.
This is your car.
It's weird, but if you don't eat for a while then your body stops being hungry. You get sort of shaky but you don't realize you haven't eaten. Have I told you about Sammy Jankis?
Easy for you to say, you've got the Jag.
Unfinished business.
Guys who'll come after her. Guys who'll want to know what happened to her boyfriend. They'll want to make somebody pay. Maybe she'll try and make it you.
She has no idea who I am.
What sort of questions?
My wife's death. I used to work in Insurance, we were well covered.
Yeah, well, thanks for the advice.
What's wrong?
He knew about Sammy. Why would I tell him about Sammy?							  *
Like you've told yourself. Over and over. Conditioning yourself to believe. "learning through repetition" -
I was wrong! That's the whole point! Sammy's wife came to me and -
Why? You're never going to know.				  *
So who are you saying he was?					*
You probably.							 *
Why would I do that?						    *
No.  I was in Namibia...
Okay.  What'd you spot...?
You need to consider a few issues.
I don't know.
All I want to know is the where and the when.  Spare me mini moves, progress reports and bullshit.
My end?
Put your guns on the table...  If we wanted you dead, you would no longer be drawing breath in Miami. We wouldn't have brought you all the way here.
What's "nothing"?
How fast does that go?
Where's that?
You know how improbable this is...?
...and therafore there is no consequence?
And why should continuing excellence cost more?
Good samba dancing...?
The range should be between fifteen and seventeen-point-five percent of the P.O.E....to even consider it.
Hola, chica.
...to fall back on.  You know, a fail-safe.  Insurance.
No part of it wasn't real.
How 'bout this?  How'd Neptune know where to hit us?  Huh?  Whose Op sec's got a leak?  Yours?
Packaging?
Yeah?
And there's Dmitri...
The people on shore who handle a load we run are our people, not your people.  No tweakers, dopers, first- timers we don't know.  They didn't do time with us, they ain't doing crime with us.
To the limit.
Like...?
Yeah.  CIA-level stuff...
A C.I. we cut loose to your Joint Interagency Task Force.  Name of Alonzo Stevens.  Now, he's YOUR informant.  Stevens, called us.  I haven't spoken to him for six months. I do not know what case you have him on.  I do not know what he is talking about.  But whatever he is doing for you, it sounds like it is going bad.  Right now...
How?
Get into business with this crew, identify them.  Illuminate their network.  If you're lucky, discover their source, how they penetrated us.  We'll indict and take it from there...
Never heard of him.
What are you talking about?
It's fucked up.  I'm sorry...
Oh, good...
C'mon, man!
You okay?
You sure?
Okay.
...the lease, the phones, the cars...layers of false ident. Would take the FBI weeks.  How long did it take them?  Three hours? Four?  This means, "We can reach out and touch somebody."  Like Bad Teleflora.
Equipment?
And violence is extra.  And expensive.  So how much weight you looking to move?
Then what were we talking to you for?
Importation value?  At twenty-two thousand a ki...
What...?
You're such a doll. I hate money, don't you? God, it's been fun.
Ain't gonna collect your pay?
Were you looking? About the Statue of Liberty?
I'm sorry. I thought you were -- never mind -- I've never actually been there, but let me see, you take the Seventh Avenue subway, I think, to the end of the line...
Maybe we should take a little nap, see what happens?
If you didn't talk so much, maybe you could think more.
I think you just put your finger on it, I do.
What's in your socks?
Hey, you're good! I bet you could pick up a living at this if you tried.
Where'd that come from?
Kee-rist, you sure are one twisty little bastard, Ratso.
Well, this thought just struck me. It wasn't too long ago I was washing dishes way the hell somewhere in Texas.
Did I say that? Did I?  It don't say nothing about you...
Well, if you're awright, why you hanging on the bannister. Can you walk or not?
They wrong?
Well, I don't think I can walk.  I mean, I been falling down a lot and, uh...
Just when everything's going my way, you gotta pull a stunt like this.
You get your first palm tree in South Carolina.
I read it.
If you have to shiver, why don't you pull the blanket up more?
Keep the goddam blanket on.
You're what?
Take it,easy, boy...  Seems to me you're different than a lotta boys that come to me. Most of 'em seem troubled, confused, but I'd say you knew exactly what you want.
Lonesomeness is something you take. You bear? Dammit, you take it and go about your business, that's all.
You're a wonderful boy. You'n me gonna have fun, dammit, it don't have to be joyless. Say, why don't we get right down on our knees now?
Ever stationed at Kennedy? Those Florida chicks...
You got it.
Get lost.
Getchmis olsun
'Figgers.
Yeah.
The airport. Trying to get on the plane for the States.
Tunnel?
Want me to take over?
Gotta be here someplace.  Thought I heard a couple of dead Christians singing down there.
Yeah. How's Mom?
Why'd you do it, Billy?
I know you kids smoke that stuff, and we drink booze, but taking it across a border - it was stupid, Billy. Stupid.
DAD!
You know where they are?
Where are the minefields?
Okay!  Ley me out right here.  I'm getting tired of all this bullshit from you.  I'll walk it.
A cabdriver. He picked me up in the Pudding Shoppe in the bazaar.
Well, you see Billy, it don't really matter right now if it's 2 kilos or 200 kilos. The Turks love to catch any foreigner smuggling - it shows the world they're fighting the drug trade.
Three, four thousand...I don't know.  The guy offered me the hash--  ...it just seemed like easy money.
Girlfriend?
How's it feel?
You just got to get yourself a good lawyer.  And some money... Talk to Max.  He's been in the longest.
What time is it?
...His money - steal that, you steal his blood... Could you see his face when everything he worked so hard to get got snatched?  If we knew where he hid it.  Anyway, steal from him they'd pick up the whole prison and shake it sideways.  We couldn't hide it anywhere.
Just got some news on Bell.
Dog eat dog, Hi-yes. You fuck other man before he fuck you.  And you must fuck last.
Vilyum, I am Necdit Yesil.
You know I have lectured at the University of Maryland in your country?  Also University Michigan Very nice country. We both go back. 
Not just any carbohydrates, mind you. It was like being on the receiving end of some kind of transcendent oral sex.  We should get a strobe on this thing. Maybe even a siren.
You really love flashing that thing, don't you?
There's some weird shit here.
Look, I showed you my badge...
What?
For Chrissakes, what's the problem? You need a memo every time you fart?
I only got...
You feel anything?
A mistake.
The kid...
It would take a minute or so.  You won't last that long out there.
He didn't do it!
Okay, meet me out front.  I gotta go. Josh's picking me up in five. see you tonight.
Honey, just leave it.
He was just doing his job.
Oh, no, you were-
It's me. Can you hear me?
C'mon...
Talk to me.
You guys have done a nice job.  How bout five dollars?
You sure you didn't see one of these?
...as long as they're ready for the opening I don't care, just tell them that.
Watch your step, Siri.  Your grant could be on the line here.
Not a big one.  I mean, it was like a turkey baster.
My God.
What do you want to know?
Well...  ...maybe it takes time to get the hang of it.
Shhh... we're just outside Silver Creek.
Your legs just sing grand opera when you move, don't they?  It's not going to hurt forever, Paul, I promise you.
Don't move now--wouldn't want to hurt this neck--  Well, the other afternoon I was on my way home, and there you were, leaving the Lodge, and I wondered why a literary genius would go for a drive when there was a big storm coming.
When do you think the phone lines'll be back up? I have to call my daughter, and I should call New York and let my agent know I'm breathing.
I have a hard and fast rule about who can read my stuff at this early stage--only my editor, my agent, and anyone who saves me from freezing to death in a car wreck.
What's it about?
Well, mine's still out. But the ones in town were working just fine. I called that agent of yours.  Oh, Paul, I peeked at the very beginning.  What a wonderful first page--just to read the name Misery Chastain...
...it's like a visit from my oldest, dearest friend.
I made you my speciality--scrambled eggs a la Wilkes. And I'm on page 75.
For a while I thought I might go crazy.
Don't get me wrong. I'm not against marriage per se. But it would take a pretty special guy to make me want to go down the aisle again.
Then who did?
You're such a kidder. I have a big surprise for you. But first there's something you must do.
I know this is the only copy, Paul. When you were twenty-four you wrote your first book and you didn't make a copy, because you didn't think anybody would take it seriously. But they did. And ever since you've never made any copies because you're superstitious--it's why you always come back to the Silver Creek Lodge. You told that story to Merv Griffin eleven years ago.
Misery's Return?
You--fooler...!  Did I do good?
Well, it does smudge after all--isn't that fascinating?
Thank you for thinking of me.  Anything else I can get while I'm in town? Any other crucial requirements that need satisfying? Would you like a tiny tape recorder? Or maybe a handmade set of writing slippers?
Poor dear... Let's get you back in bed and I'll get them for you.
What's the matter, Paul? You haven't written a word.
Well, is it fair? Should I keep going?
Annie, what is it?
When you first came here, I only loved the writer part of Paul Sheldon. But now I know I love the rest of him too. As much as Misery loves Ian.  I know you don't love me--don't say you do--you're a beautiful, brilliant, famous man of the world; and I'm...not a movie star type. You'll never know the fear of losing someone like you if you're someone like me.
Paul, I know you've been out.
Oh, Paul. It's beautiful.
The stranger staying at the Inn, is he someone from Misery's past?
This is so exciting. It's Windthorne, her first love, right?
It was an old car--those dents could have been there forever.
Hey, Jim, what's doing? Uh-huh... uh- huh... Jim, we've been over this. If you're gonna have benches in front of your store, people are gonna sit on them. I don't like him either, but I'm not going to come over there and tell him to move. Give my best to Denise. Bye.
"There is a justice higher than that of man. I will be judged by Him."
They're hauling Misery into court.
Just leave it, all right?
I'll bet that old Mustang's pulling into New York right now.
Hey, Pete.
Do you have any of those new Paul Sheldon books?
You wouldn't happen to remember if Miz Wilkes bought one, would you?
An old friend. I was rummaging through a closet and it was just sitting there. Like it was waiting for me.
Marcia, please.
I thought you were over it.
- right -  - don't go too far ahead of me now -
Not everything.  Why do you think she's really here?
You're not interested in seeing how it looks.
To win?
I would've thought the hardest part was exercising restraint.  Curbing that pressing need of your to get your gun off.  You were in such a hurry to knock off that 747, you never figured out where the virus really was.
There it is, guys, the last of it.
She doesn't belong here, Sean.  Let her go.
Not exactly.  Wallis?
-- now here's the way it's going to work..Wallis, the shares outstanding are..
What you got there, mate?
Well you know his blokes'll place the OSCOR in his annex, where else if you're pinpointing transmitters, video signals, covert chip cameras, anything radiating, oscillating..
Wrong.  All we've got to worry about is Ambrose.  Nyah will take care of Nyah.
Ambrose obviously got these from Nekhorvich on the plane.
Before we kill her or cure her..
That's it?  That's it? That's it?
She's in the elevator heading toward Ethan.
Look, it's either you or the rent and I don't mind telling you it's not an easy choice.
What are you doing here?
Where's the bloody -
- this is very disconerting..
Sounds smashing.  I'm in.  Muchacho, mi carro, por favor!  Now be serious.  You couldn't possibly want me off tonight's performance..
Hola..
I need your help and I thin you can use mine.
They've got a book for this?
That's not the point.  In the end what spies rely on is the one thing they think they know that you don't.
Spoken like a spook..you ever afraid?
So would I.  But it's not mine to give.
Not me.  I was just hoping you might..or that..somehow in the course of business this got personal as well as physical.
Sean will never be anything but suspicious if he picks up some sort of 'yoo-hoo-I'm- not-nad' message.  Not after the way we broke up.
-- his left jacket pocket.
Nyah, you've done more than enough.  Even the best of snake charmers get bit.
What did you think you were doing!
- you who don't have a conscience.
Like what?
So there's one thing we know Ambrose doesn't.
Sean feels he hasn't done the job unless he leaves a lot of hats on the ground.
'Terrorists?'
Excuse me?
She's got no training for this kind of thing.
You mean that leaves Miss Hall.
Why not?  You've done just about everything else on this operation.
Of course it was.  Anyone whose operations requires the level of disinformation that yours do, is bound to get a little flak here and there.  You try flogging the stories on CNN I've had to come up with about what's been going on around here the last few days.  At any rate, it's been most instructive -- what they'll swallow, or what they'll broadcast with a straight face.  Miss Hall's blood, it appears, has absolutely no elements of the Chimera virus.  Not even antibodies.
I do.
Luther..get us everything you can on the outbreak of influenza on Bruny Island last month, including photos of the victims.
Nekhorvich's boss?
Ambrose just pulled the memory card out of the digital camera and put it into an envelope, put it in his inner left jacket pocket...
I don't know, but Nekhorvich was not a manic.  Get me a twenty on Nyah.
Luther, I'm looking at security.
Ethan, I keep telling you there's not a chance of locating Nyah til I access the satellite and there's not a chance of doing that til I get this thing booted up and running!  How much time does she have left?
A visit from an old friend.
Oh, please!  How was I to know they had to be treated with Bellerophon within twenty hours?
Kasimov, Kasimov, good that you called us.
Come on!
Maybe we donit have to know what he looks like.  If heis got that list, heis going to want to check it.  We should be looking for laptops.
Two minutes til Krieger shows.  Thisill have to be quicker than Iid like. Certainly quicker than youid like.
Satisfied?
Donit Jim.
Krieger can get it.  Right?
I don't think you're in any position to give orders, do you?  Not while I'm holding this.
Ethan -- Ethan, it's okay.  It's Claire. Ethan what's wrong with you?
There was nobody on the bridge.
They're dead.  Jim's dead.
Did they send you...Did they send you?
Ethan, you're not making sense. Let me go in and talk to Kittridge. I'm going to tell him you had nothing to do...
Jim was my husband. I want to know who killed him.  I want to get the son of a bitch who did this.
Two cars.  Where are you?
This is Kittridge.
I donit think so.
Youire in Prague?
I can't tell you how sorry I am.  I know how much Jim in particular meant to you, Ethan.  Personally as well as professionally.
That's right.  Max, it seems, has two unique gifts -- a capacity for anonymity and for corrupting susceptible agents. This time he's gotten to someone on the inside - he's put himself in a position to buy our NOC list. An operation he referred to as "Job 314".  The job he thought Golitsyn was doing tonight.
I can't just hack my way inside.  There's no modem access to the mainframe, it's in a stand-alone.  I'd have to be physically at the terminal.
I'm not letting this list get out in the open.
It's hard to tell.  I'm gonna have to be close.
You're more than that, Luther.  They were mistaken about you and they're trying to show you they know it.  They want you back in.
It's all one big negotiation, isn't it?
Just don't know why I'd be doing it.
I don't know Job any more than he knows me.
<u>Ten</u> million.  Ten million in negotiable U.S. Treasury certificates, in bearer form, coupons attached.  And one more thing -- your personal assurance that Job will be at the exchange.
You're not going to any meeting without me.
Claire.
IS THERE ANY PARTICULAR REASON WE'RE NOT OUT OF HERE YET?!
In position.  Jack open the door, let the package roll.
Forty-four.  Forty-five.
..the next day I managed to drag myself to the safe house, must've just missed you..anyway, I checked our aliases.
..when you think about it, Ethan, it was inevitable..no more Cold War.  No more secrets you keep from everyone but yourself, operations you answer to no one but yourself.  Then one morning you wake up and find out the President of the United States is running the country - <i>without your permission</i>.  The son-of-a- bitch!  How <i>dare</i> he?  You realize itis over, youire an obsolete piece of hardware not worth upgrading, youive got a lousy marriage and sixty-two grand a year.  Kittridge, weill go after that no good son-of-a-bitch, big time!
Jim...?
I usually am.
What's going on?
How long until we reach the Chunnel?
Oh, you're not going. You're staying.
Are you ready?
I don't like him.
I won't pay for nothing.
You were altogether asleep. You were dreaming.
You look tired.
He got hit by a bus.
You've got to come. You've got to give me away.
And maybe that's why I had the Bad Luck. Maybe if you gave me away, and I got married in a church, in a wedding dress, instead of at the City Hall with strangers standing outside the door, maybe then I wouldn't had the Bad Luck I had.
I didn't have no wedding cake, no reception or nothing. Johnny got down on his knees and proposed to me at The Grand Ticino.
So you'll come to the wedding, right?
You're married.
You haven't once said you like my dress.
What do you want me to do? Pick up after five dogs? I'm eighty-three years old. God in his heaven understands that I cannot pick up after five dogs.
I won't have to shoot those dogs. They will kill each other.
At dinner, my daughter-in-law threatened to kill me. Things are very bad in my house.
Why?
You are going to marry my brother?
I have no life.
Loretta. What's that smell?
When your husband get hit by the bus?
How many men since then?
Why you talking to me?
Why are you marrying Johnny? He's a fool!
It's so bright.
Oh my God.
What? What have we done?
I'm marrying your brother!
You're invited to the wedding! It's in a few weeks. Why didn't you do like him and be with your dying mother in Palermo?
Snap out of it!
Of what? Only God can point the finger, Loretta.
Why not?
Let me go home.
Let me go home.
No, I'll tell him.
It's Johnny Cammareri.
Will you marry me?
I like this ring.
Yeah.
He's my younger brother.
Ssh, it's me. I'm calling from the deathbed of my mother.
WHAT?
What?
What's thirty-seven? I had Chiro after I was thirty-seven. It ain't over till it's over.
How's the mother?
Did he tell her?
What the hell happened to you?
No. But I have a hangover.
What? He's in Sicily!
Alright.
He should pay.
Don't fight.
The breath had almost totally left her body. She was as white as snow. And then she completely pulled back from death and stood up and put on her clothes and began to cook for everyone in the house. The mourners. And me. And herself! She ate a meal that would choke a pig!
Well. There's the Bible story. God took a rib from Adam and made Eve. Maybe men chase women to get the rib back. When God took the rib, he left a hole there, place where there used to be something. and the women have that. Maybe a man isn't complete as a man without a woman.
That's it! That's the reason!
Because my mother was dying! But now she's not.
May I presume to ask you a question?
Do you have a girlfriend?
Sheila? Yes she was. Is. Was.
Go ahead.
Maybe. Listen. You wanna know why I chase women? I find women charming.
You knew that man?
I'm too old for me. That's my predicament.
It's a house.
Look.
And you were a lamb. As soft as milk.
She's got it.
Ah.  Yes, of course ... um ... err ...
Get away!
Where did you get the coconuts?
Look! To maintain Velocity, a swallow needs to beat its wings four hundred and ninety three times every second.   right?
Am I right?
Dennis! There's some lovely filth down here ...  Oh! how d'you do?
Order, eh -- who does he think he is?
Well, I didn't vote for you.
The same!
Oh!
All right!  What do you want?
A what?
Yes ...
What is that?
What word?
None shall pass.
Then you shall die.
Now stand aside worthy adversary.
Look!
Stop that.
Hello.
Good Sir knight, will you come with me to Camelot, and join our number at the Round Table?
What is your name?
You know my name?
... make plain the last resting place of the most Holy Grail.
Je...sus Christ!
Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.
:I'm thirty-seven ... I'm not old.
What I object to is that you automatically treat me like an inferior ...
... But all the decision of that officer ...
... but a two-thirds majority ...
You can't expect to wield supreme executive power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you!
Oh, Did you hear that!  What a give-away.
What is your name?
My name is Sir Robin of Camelot!
'Ere.  He says he's not dead.
I promised I'd be at the Robinson's.  They've lost nine today.
Thanks very much.
Why?
One day, lad, all this will be yours ...
Who are you?
We don't need to do anything, apart from just stop him entering the room.
If we ... er ... 
Oh, I remember ... can he ... er ... can he leave the room with us?
The Castle Anthrax?
Well ...
We are just not used to handsome knights ...  But you are wounded!
Camelot ...
Well ... yes ...
When you have found the shrubbery, then you must cut down the mightiest tree in the forest ... with a herring.
Stop saying the word!
They're all saying the word ...
|      You turd! +      Mangy scots git!
I done it again.
If you were looking for promotion, you should have picked one of the healthier ones.
Which one of us is she flirting with?
And she sent no word down?
What's this?
Won't you give yourself a rest, John? She's other people to look out for her.
I fear the influence he has on her. The man's word is not to be credited. He is an arriviste of the very lowest water.  She's having a bust cast of him.  In Nero Marquino marble.
I don't imagine you frequent the Republican Clubs.  But the fact that neither you nor I are members should not blind us to the significance of their existence.  The Tory Party has always been our party.
I wish to see my mother.
Mama...
Checked and locked, sir.
That can wait till the weekend.
What do you know about the Highlands?
You sent for me.
Princes and Lords are but the breath of kings, An honest man's the noblest work of God.  You must miss such magnificent views.
Oh.
Was there never ambition?
Too busy looking after themselves.
Yes.  You have a brother in service here, do you not?  I forget his name.
Am I not safe enough with you, John?
John?
I was told you were in a fight.
Has someone seen to those bruises?
What can we do?
Is that not enough?
A distinct flushing around the cheeks. She was drunk, I tell you.
We think she can be dissuaded.  Have you had a glance at the diary?
Forgive me, Your Majesty.  In no way did I wish to suggest--
No.  You are mistaken.  Prince Albert, my husband, had typhoid fever.  I asked what was wrong with my son.
Who told them that?
Why not?
Does that thing work?
What do you mean?
We vere thinking there might be tricks. You know, surprises that you'd worked into the game...
But how can it change every time?
Nick, Alex, how are we today?
Talk to me.
He thinks I'm "sublimating".
So where is he?
Hmmm.  He said you were going to have dinner?
I have to talk to you.
What do you mean by "weird"?
Can you turn off the game?
That's what I thought.
Maybe it is alive in a way...some sort of electronic intelligence.  It's like a computer virus that developed a personality or something.  It's self-replicating...it mimics life.
It's growing.  Getting stronger. Maybe it's only localized now...
The Police, then...
Then where do we go?!
Jesus Christ!
Alex...
I don't understand.  It wants us to play the game.  It's been taunting us ...
You're not coming, Alex.
Hey, my strength's low.  Look out for Fireflies.
Christ...no time...
We can take the dunes down like a ski slope. Pretend you're on a snowboard.
Is...is that where we are?  Did I die?
So how do I start?
You've got to talk to Ray you've got to fix this.
Sort of, funny boy. If I tell him the meeting's on you're to go to the top of Beachwood Canyon. There's a corral up there where he'll be.
So what's the problem?
Sure want to thank ya for drivin' all the way up to see me from that Beverly Hills Hotel.
Well, just stop for a little second and think about it. Will ya do that for me?
No. You're too busy being a smart aleck to be thinkin'. Now I want ya to think and quit bein' such a smart aleck. Can ya do that for me?
Unbelievable. Look... here.  I don't know what's going on. That's so much baloney. I've got enough cash for one night, okay?
I guess it was your grandfather, was it ... he called me to check in, said you were on your way and for you to call when you get in. Nice man... farmer I hear.
Your Aunt called me.
Sorry to trouble you, Coco.
That's okay.
Betty.
Yes?
What's wrong?
Well...  what do you think about then? I mean...  well what do you think about?
I don't know.
Mulholland Drive.
That's where I was going... Mulholland Drive.
No.... I don't...
Okay... but just...just to see.
There's nothing?
Strange to be calling yourself.
"Really?"
"You're playing a dangerous game here. If you're trying to blackmail me... it's not going to work."
I hope I'm back in a couple of hours. Don't drink all the coke. 
When I get back I'll have the cab waiting, so be ready to go.
Those men in front, in the car.
Rita... I know what you're doing.
Yeah, sure. Look what happened to them.
What's  the matter now?
Why did you want to go to breakfast if you're not hungry?
You feel it?
Yeah ... and they both use the same address.
Hardly.
No ... thanks though... I'll take a cigarette if you have one.
And now ladies and gentlemen it's time for the fabulous CROCODILE SHOW !
You have 43 unpaid parking tickets, sir. You have the right to remain silent, anything you say can & will be held.....
Why should we trust you ?
What are you doing ?
Hey ! I'm still your best chance to get out of here alive.
Do you have something better to talk about ?
He hired you to build this place ?
There's more to it than trying to see if you'd steal from the company or if you'd lie or cheat.
Doesn't anyone notice all the people missing ?
How can you just take a life ? I mean it's a life, life is so precious.  How does it feel ?
I wanted to let his family know....
Just remember, hold your breath as long as you can. Then go right over to that corner. The door will open and go in and up.
This is cute.
Where are we going ?
Apparently pretty high, we just got a new CEO last week.
Yeah a real shame.
Are you Matthew Parker ?
I thought you made this place ?
What's next Walt ?
Be very, very quiet...
The room has sound sensors. If you wake it up, it breathes fire.
An elevator ?
Issues ??? This guy has the damn subscription to every psychotic issue I've ever heard of.
Hey, try swimming. It works.
Is it over ?
I didn't think he'd make it past Scraps.
Don't.
He'll never get it right. Try the Log Ride !
Johnny, let's get the cleanup started.
Trust is earned not given away.
He already had a balance of $600,000.
Parking tickets ? That's it ?
You think I'm that easy, Bitch ?
Sir, I came from the Chicago offices myself, and if I may say, sir, there are still some very good....
I have entrusted you with a great many things. In your tenure with this company you have seen and heard things that could upset the very economic world in which we live. I think this kind of loyalty should be rewarded.
What about that time when the mail room kid was accused of stealing and we put him in the "Park" ? Wasn't that a computer glitch ?
I propose we consider a hostile take over. Perhaps Ol' Bruce is in need of a new job opportunity.
I'll bet that would be the Park run of the century !
I'm willing to bet that even the creator can't out wit his creation.
Sir ? We're moving them right along as fast as we can.
He has a phone pole sticking in his chest, I think we don't need an autopsy.
Hey, Mr. Executive. Buy you a drink sailor ?
I thought, and correct me if I'm wrong, but weren't you trying to play both sides ?
No. I am not a homosexual.
How long till the drug wears off ?
What is Bruce doing ?
We can't afford too many surprises.
I've got five bucks that says someone dies here and now.
Aren't you going to switch exits on him again ?
Good golly miss molly you are looking good today !
Just look at this tie. You could fry an egg off that orange, yow. Have you ever considered the Jerry Garcia line of ties ?
Really ? On a date ?
I just want to have something that's mine, you know ? It's like living off of their money is fun and all. There are certain materialistic needs that I have that can only be satisfied with that extra little scratch.
It's that asshole Zach isn't it ?
Hey Matty, don't wait for me or anything.
He was right behind me !
Umm, where do you want this?
My mother took this course with you at UCLA...&quot;The Foundations of Poetic Thought&quot;.
Her name was Maggie Muldovan.
I'm sure she found your lectures fascinating.
How did you know my name?
THANK YOU.
Give us a break. All you have to do is make a phone call.
Look, sergeant I know I said some things last time that I shouldn't have said at all but...
So charge him with something...who's gonna know?
Do you wanna be a hall monitor all your life?
Vada, try to scrunch these chairs together a little more.
Shelly's already told me all about sex.
She was talented, but honey I wish I could help you a little more, it's just that your mother and I had kind of a whirlwind courtship, she came to town with this traveling theater group, I proposed on our second date, two weeks later we were married and almost nine months later you were here and she was gone.
No nuns, got it.
What does that mean?
Well if there was an article about it I'm sure she did. She was always reading.
She can spread her wings, right here in Pennsylvania. You don't send a child alone to Los Angeles, she could come back with her ears pierced, her legs shaved and God knows what else.
His name's Harry Sultenfuss.
Are you saying my mother had another husband?
Sure am, who are you?
I'm glad you're here.
We have this school assignment to write about someone we never met and I chose my mother. She was born in Los Angeles and since my uncle Phil moved out here I came in to visit him and then I looked at her high school yearbook and...  and I called a few people and one guy said that she went to UCLA, another guy said that I should call Hillary Mitchell so....
I don't know very much about her...I was hoping that you could help me.
Do you have any pictures if her?
Well I didn't know about you until after she was gone.
I'd say you turned out just fine.
See you? He can smell you from there.
You're crazy, what was her big achievement? Did she invent gravity?
This is really very nice of you.
If it's in here at all, it's in the back two rows.
Vada what about you, who have you come up with?
If the fruit burst into flames I'll be prepared.
Make that sixty and I'm docking your allowance for two weeks.
I don't need you to be telling me to...
You know eavesdropping is a very unattractive habit.
I never did understand that story, did someone find the needle or not?
It's the leather bindings, I love the fragrance of vintage books.
Don't forget, the girls change their names if they got married.
I think it's cool.
Just call us the &quot;dead end kids&quot;.
Boy, you're really into this.
Does it work?
Do you think your friend's up in Heaven now, looking down on you and watching you all the time?
You mean,  this ring?
What's he smoking?
Maybe not...but maybe it does. If no one told me about this, I mean...maybe they're trying to hide something.
You mean...it wasn't that terrible?
Muh??
I don't think the color of the interior is....
How about Nick? Did he take good care of you?
She lives here too?
But...are you engaged or something?
Sounds like you have a fear of commitment, Uncle Phil.
I had to be, I only have five days. So just point me in the right direction and....
Do you think I should tell my dad about Jeffrey Pommeroy?
He was caressing.
Oh, yeah, sure, help yourself.
So what's wrong?
Oh, are you a hairdresser?
...It's all in the hands really. You know you have nice hands, you operate?
Oh no, I, I...eh...I couldn't.
Then Grammoo said on Christmas Eve, there was this sickening smell permeating the entire house.
How would you like to go visit your Uncle Phil in Los Angeles...next week during your spring vacation, you could do research on your mom.
Hey, you didn't pay me!
Danny?
Okay, I know you've suffered a terrible loss, and there's really nothing anyone can do to comfort you, but I urge you to focus on the times you had with the camper, the trips you took, the sights you saw, those days are gone now, but they'll live on in your heart forever.
God I guess i'll have to introduce you now.
Ex...ex, ex...
Can't you see it?
I can't breathe, I'm suffocating.
I have a wonderful disposition, I put people right at ease.
Stiffs??
Ohh, oh sure it's no big deal, you see all my former clients will eventually die, and all your clients used to be alive, so they have something in common.
I think she looks nice! Her lips are very thin so I used the gloss to give them a more sensual quality, and her eyes just needed a little definition, and her hair, I'm sorry, nobody wears this hairdo anymore in 1972.
Well the other night at dinner...
I don't think so, I think she's confused about death.
Can not do without, Harry's wild about me.
I do enjoy playing bingo, if you'd like to join me for a game tomorrow night at church you're welcome to.
Would you like to come in and see my house? Just for a minute.
No, why?
This is where we are.
What are you wearing?
Watch you don't knock out a fish.
I was born jaundiced. Once I sat on a toilet seat at a Truck stop and caught hemorrhoids. And i've learned to live with this chicken Bone that's been lodged in my throat for the past three years, so I knew Dad would be devastated when he learned of my latest affliction.  Dad, I don't wanna upset you, but my left breast is developing at a significantly faster rate than my right. It can only mean one thing.  Cancer.  I'm dying.
Of course not.
Ahh, I just wanna look nice.
When?
Do you miss her?
I think every time I see a climbing tree i'll think of Thomas J.
Well well well, what's going on in here?
Why?
Did you not tell Vada I'm a womanizer huh?
No, no no....
I love you like my Dad loves Shelly. I wanna live here.
Really?
My Dad was funny?
Who's winning?
You know Vada, you shouldn't let those girls upset you.
He's allergic to everything.
Ooh, that's a pretty ring you're wearing.
He won't give it to me.
Vada? VADA?? What happened??
Hi.
I would.
Bye. Well Miss Vada, what d'you say we head back?
I think lipstick looks fake, no-ones lips are that color.
Shelly, do you think I'm pretty?
Do you like putting makeup on people?
Hey Shelly, like seafood?
I like my name.
I won, I won!!!
Thomas J?
It doesn't work, it always stays black. 
Naah, I don't wanna.
Your lip bleeding?
Hey look at this!
Hmmmm, interesting.
You have no personality.
Heaven.
Watch bingo? I don't even like to play bingo.
Hey Vada, guess what we got?
Woah!!
Pointing There's a beehive right there!
Got it!
Jump in the water!!
Hi Vada.
You can come to my house for dinner?
Oh, that's probably Thomas J, I don't wanna see him. It's not fair. Nothing happens to boys.
Say something it's too quiet.
You better not either.
Seeya tomorrow.
Yeah, it's in the contract.
Is it ever embarrassing, having your bum kissed in public?
Whenever George tells someone how steadfast I am, he always makes me sound boring.
Blood oath.
You think...
He's not proposing marriage, there's no way I'm buying one word of th...
You have no appropriate sense of emergency.  My best friend is ruining his life.
He's adored me for nine goddamn years.
This is my whole life's happiness. I have to be ruthless.
Jesus.  You're supposed to take your make-up off before you apply the m...
Zit cream?
How do you know you can touch that plug? Are you a licensed contractor?
I suppose it's too late to start over.
I'm taking my next book to Viking.
But I can't be dry.
I thought bridesmaids had to wear the same dress.
It depends.  If San Antonio sweeps Sacramento, we could start there. Or Phoenix.  Or depending on Indiana- Clevel...
He sucks soup through his front teeth.
And the answer was so simple.
Jesus, we're trapped!
Stop, we're embarrassing h...
About Michael's job.
But he always says...
Gold dog collars? They don't have dogs.
I never want to go through this again.
Well.  See.  That was a... reflex to see if it would...
Under the circumstances.  Charmed to know you, Jules.
Is anybody watching?
Maybe.  I should call Ben.
Well, you're a little early...
I've been calling for days!
And she's all wrong for me!
Well, the Sox are at home.  SI's letting me do a profile on the Big Hurt.  That's Frank...
What's the sec...
Luckily.  The closer I watched, the more the fault came into focus.  Each imperfection its own adorable slice of vulnerability.
Waiter! Check, please!
Where was that, Florence, huh?
Pretty amazing girl, you've got. Make that kind of sacrifice.
Don't you throw up on boat?
You've sort of been... y'know, the woman in my life.
It's no big deal, she just gave you the wrong keys that's s...
Michael...
The Big Hurt, huh?
Jules, what's wrong...
Lower.
Well, the school will be here. Architecture will still be around. Right now...
Because I could come...
It's not just a gag, huh?
And to m...
I'm sure glad I'm hearing all this now, before it's too late!
You're from out of town?
Barnett, please -
What's wrong with her.
You going today?
Yes.
I guess that's why he thought you right want to help out.
Everybody likes to be as good as their word.
What?
That's what he wants.
Okay, then we'll see you there.
Hi. I'm John Triplette.
Well, I'm here putting together a show. It's a benefit really.
What's he running for?
Okay.
You're kidding.
Yes. I was in my Sophomore year at Harvard.
Mr. Green?
My wife and I think so, but we're family. Your family's always good or bad depending on how you look at your family. What do you do, pick or sing?
He is just wonderful.
All they got is advertisements. Just like L.A.
Well, I could use one, especially if I'm pregnant.
I said, maybe I'll change my name again.
What's this?
Who's that?
How do you know?
You must really like him.
Listen, your Aunt Ester just died. I'm... sorry... Listen, I really Feel bad now about last night...We had no...
You got a place to stay?
Parts.
I feel really good.
No. No, they're white. He's got a nice dog.
Weather's been awful. All those bombs dropping. It changes our weather. Sure not like the good old days.
I want to get the dog off my bed.
Have your children been deaf since birth?
Hello.
I'm not sure. Where?
What?
Wrong.
I knew when I first met you.
I'm forty-six. Do you like to go up or down?
Where are you going?
Not yet. Listen, Norman, I want...
I mean...
No  Hell, some secretary in New York just hands it to you. Only this one kept dropping it out of the box.
Dent it a little. Boy -- just she couldn1t even find it. She had a hamburger on her desk that looked three weeks old.
Oh --
Oh yea -- There has never been a better time for something new.
He is to a lot of people.
Oh, you meet them at parties and stuff.
Got me an audition tonight.
You sure do it loud.
Wade -- I've been working toward this audition for years.
You think it will?
Oh, why thank you.
So, I think it would be safe to say that anybody who studied the fighting style that Bruce Lee, arguably the greatest martial artist of all times, developed for nine years, that would be a fella who could defend himself. Would you describe Tim that way, Grace?
Thank you. Grace, there is one other thing...
What kind of pies do you have?
Which do you recommend?
Mallory, what did you think of Mickey's plan? Did you think it would work?
Try to keep it to a minimum.
I take it by your answer it was a whole new team?
Congratulations on the Curtis Fox case, Scagnetti. You put an end to a nightmare. The ladies of this city can get to sleep again, and they have you to thank.
They've killed a shitload of inmates and guards---
The public loves you Jack...You don't mind if I call you Jack, do you?
Okay, buddy boy, where ya keepin' Mallory? I know she's still here, and I know you know where. So, start talking or my first work as a director will be your death scene.
How come you never talk?
Yeah. Ya see, I ordered that special.
You ready, Donut?
Sorry about that.
So, Mickey, tell us what you do for fun.
Was an instant of purity worth a lifetime lie? Yeah, it was.
Tell me about the purity.
Okay, we're going out that door, and we're gonna march down the hall and right out of the building.  Donut said something about a news van.
Where's it parked?
C'mon, c'mon, let's hurry this up.
Just wait one fucking minute.
Wait! You can't kill me. Mickey and Mallory always leave somebody alive to tell the tale.
Let's make a little music, Colorada.
Hypnotizing.
---and a snake-eye glare, Arnold was able to totally psyche out any confidence Ferigno had.
And then Mallory stops Mickey and says, 'Hey, these are the Brothers Hun.'
Apparently, they've seen all our films.
So, Mallory calls 911 and they took off.
What do you think, Pitney? How much Explosives do you think that they really have in there?
Drink up! This is a celebration. This is the day we received word we were gonna make television history. We're gonna have the first sit down, in depth interview with the most charismatic serial killer ever, one day before he's being shipped to a mental hospital for the rest of his life. This is one of those golden moments that happens maybe only four times in a lucky journalist's career. This is Wallace with Noriega, this is Elton John confessing his bi-sexuality to the Rolling Stone, this is the tearful reporting of the Hindenberg disaster, this is Truffaut setting the record straight on Hitchcock, this is a Robert Capa photo, this is Woodward and Bernstien meeting Deep Throat in an underground parking lot, this is John Reid reporting 'The Ten Days That Shook The World', this is the hippies' bloody palms at Kent State, the Maysles brothers at Altamont, this is the Nixon/Frost interviews...
What the hell happened to you?
Are you all set?
We got tonight and tomorrow to get our shit together. The day after that they're shippin' Mallory. That's when we do the Mickey Knox interview, 'cause the next day he goes.
How's it working, Scotty?
Camera jam! I'm sorry Wayne. God.
By taking away our legs. Now we have to fight harder to get ahead than anyone else you'll find in this gym. Probably the whole city. They gave us the fighting spirit. Before this happened I was content. Now I'm pissed off. Now I'm half a man and I've got to work like the devil to get whole again.
Hello, Mr. Gayle. I'm Phil Wurlitzer. We talked on the phone. It's a pleasure to meet you.
Scott, genius cameraman, Roger, magician with sound. Unruly Julie, I could sooner do without my arm than Unruly Julie.
Ya know, I was.
I was on the 'Dukes of Hazzard' set about eight years ago.
Two guys?
I'm not running out and getting that piece of shit a Coke.
Give her a beer.
Where' you goin'?
You know, Doris - you'd make some guy a swell wife.
Boy - you hear me?!
That's no way to talk, boy. Now we had one of them union men 'round here coupla years ago. Stirred up a lot of trouble. They're always after you colored boys.
What's the matter, boy? Never smile?
Walker and Williams.
What d'you want?
She got herself a husband now. They don' want him 'round. And I tell you, man, I got no use for him neither.
I don't know. He's your boy.
Yeah. Look, I'll be sendin' you the money from now on.
They say your dad's 'round town.
Hey, boy - I'm talkin' to you.
How 'you doing?
And his age?
Been over to the other mill?
That's two bucks, Joe.
In Birmingham.
Your folks live there?
That's right.
That's pretty good for a preacher's daughter.
How about another beer?
Let's go, Duff.
How come you stay 'round here?
That's why you come back, huh?
What?
You have some very primitive ideas, don't you?
Yeah. Knocked around for a couple of months after the Army. You been there?
Your boy.
What about that girl?
Is that so?
What's wrong?
Oh really? I thought it was pretty good.
Hmmm - good coffee.
You know how to box?
Like so. There you go. Okay, hit me!
Don't look so scared.
How come you keep askin'?
Don't deny me, Duff.
Hi.
Hell, if they don't blow up his place, they'll get him some other way. Don't make no difference no-how.
Okay.
Just get her drunk.
Like a home, for one thing.
I guess you'll be making' some changes 'round here.
'See ya.
Take it easy, Pop.
How often is that?
They'll run you out.
How 'you gonna live?
It's a changing time. Sit down, son.
I think if you tried livin' in a town like this, instead of running free and easy, you'd soon change your tune.
I know just how you feel, son. But believe me, you're going about it the wrong way.
Maybe I could talk to Bud Ellis. He might have a job for you at his filling station.
Man, you won't like that back seat.
Well, I got married to one of them.
Baby - want you to meet Duff.
No. Why?
So don't pull this cowboy shit now. You'll give him a target.  You'll get yourself killed.  Just keep talking.
We got any shots?
Peter said you came to kill us. Is that true?
Take this off.
Easy...
What's an A.I.
Those are all your records. I can have you cleared on all counts. Possession. ...Contributing to the delinquency of minors... Statutory rape.
Your gun, your prints. The Tessiers might overlook a little child molesting, but murder's bad P.R., Mr. Riviera. I suggest to reconsider my offer.
First sign of free will, Sense/Net usually slags 'em.
Anything rated higher than a P.C.'s got a hard-wired suicide switch. It'll self- destruct.
You ran without us.
Good question. He may not have intended to. The girl in question is Lady 3Jane. She's very important to us. The third clone of Lady Jane Tessier.
You've got your orders.
You find out in exactly two hours and forty-five minutes.
An odd selection, Mr Case.
You're busy monkeys, Mr. Case. Busy, busy monkeys. Always building models... First stone circles. Then cathedrals... adding machines. I have no idea why I exist, do you know that? You... Your species eventually _had_ to create me. A thousand monkeys sitting at typewriters. One finally wrote "Wintermute".
The access code to your mainframe.
Ah, Herr Case. And how is the artiste tonight?
Last I heard you cracked Sukura International. I couldn't believe it.
Four men. Babylon soldiers.
I can't feel nothing because I am nothing.  Just playback. A ghost in the machine.
I'm surprised you still are. Should'a told me you had an A.I. running probes at you.
What about the A.I., Dix? Sense/Net hasn't even been able to trace it.
Yo.
Bright enough to be dangerous.
He was an M.P. in Bangkok back in '21. Caught some shrapnel in the cerebral cortex and wound up living off a machine in a vegetable ward in Berne. Then, last September... surprise, surprise... he just seemed to disappear.
It's possible. The guy was a blank slate.
Could be suicidal. It's not easy to kill yourself with all those hard wired defence programs.
Well, it ain't exactly a bed of roses down here. We gonna run or not?
What are you talkin' about?
It'll flatline your ass.
Take a look. Son of a bitch won't feel a thing until it's too late.
Meet me back here in twenty-five. We'll kick this open if we can. But, Case... you need that access code or you'll just fry inside.
One minute eighteen and counting. What about the access code?
This thing's loaded with internal virus systems. You'll fry like an egg in there.
I hear that shit once a week. Don't worry. Jo Jo Bao loves me.
I had to limit your options.
Excellent. That's exactly what I had in mind. But if you're going to kill me, we have to work together, old son. I'm no pushover, you know.
I hope you can show more than you did when you let the Yakuza butcher Linda Lee.
His name's Armitage. He's very anxious to meet you.
What is it?
Sorry. That's not gonna happen.
Maybe something's onto him.
How long have I been out?
On a good run... yeah.
When I was fifteen Sense/Net iced my old man's credit record over some computer error. Once that goes down, that's it. He lost his business... everything. It destroyed him. I had to hustle arcade games for chump change. Dixie McCoy found me, figured I was a natural. He taught me the wires for a piece of the action.
Technically, yeah, but people have made it back after as long as three minutes.
You okay?
It sounds like you.
I'll get the car.
Case... Are you alright?
Le Vingtieme Siecle. We're meeting Armitage there for the midnight floor show.
When they did my eyes, I made them promise I'd still be able to cry. Sounds stupid, doesn't it?
Peter... What do you think you're doing?
Like what?
Guy Perkins and his amazing Lemmings. They push your car out of its space, hide it, then watch while you look for it. We've taken to chaining ours together for safety. I'm Aldys.
Aldys, don't miss your prom--it only happens once.
Go away. I have enough work here to last me all night.
I had a lunch break so I thought I'd come by and see you. Your teacher is a fox!  Why don't we discuss that after class. But the burning is totally normal.  Oh look. Class is over already.
Okay. If you've never kissed a guy, we got bigger problems than the underwear.
You don't think I can do it.
Okay, just so I'm clear here -- neither of you think I can do this.
How about this?
What is this?
Hey Josie. It's Josie, right?
: Wait. Do you know any gay guys?
Hey Josie- who did Archie date Betty or Veronica?
You've done five of my ideas.
They don't have to be in the office Christmas show?
A--flack jacket.
Don't worry, I'll straighten all this out.
No, I am appalled that I have a reporter in there, undercover, for almost three weeks now- I had to read about this in the Tribune.
Responding officers found minors, marijuana, and cheap wine coolers when they responded to a call to break up a party at what Southglen High Schoolers have come to call "The Court." Seventeen-year-old Kristen Rey says, "Yeah, everyone who's anyone is at The Court on Saturday night."
And that's the best part.  "Teacher-Student Relations: How close is too close?" We're gonna blow the lid off it!
Rob's?
Maybe we should go in a different room?
God, I can't do this.
Okaaaay....  That car's going to bankrupt you.
This--this is a luau that sells packing material!
Wow. This must be big.
Are you crazy?! You can't do this.
Wow, Josie- you look really-
Yes. Exactly. Major Rufus.
No, you weren't. Don't you realize the only time I was really happy in the last five years was when I was playing ball with those guys?
So what are you thinking for college?
Josie you owe it to yourself to go. For your writing. You're a natural.
Oh right. The Spiderman incident.
You have to say that. You're my teacher.
Maybe distant cousins. They did have that egg shape in common.
Our penguin, right?
Josie--you make a really beautiful prom queen.
Billy Prince is asking you to prom.
Into our group.
We'd love to transition a gay guy into the group.
By name.
<i>                                   ... Let's draw straws.</i>
The deadly nightshade you slipped me wore off, Sally... I thought I'd find you here....
Yes.
If you went away, what would become of me?
Uh-huh.
Jesse, help!
There is no Jesse.  I'm Jesse now.
You two got a thing going, or what?
So, you live around here.
You remember your dreams, Grady?
your timing was perfect - I was getting the third degree in there.
Hi!  You didn't have to wait.
You okay?
You shouldn't be fighting with that jerk.
You mean a shithead.
I figured you might like some help.
At first I wasn't sure because you said that you never had anyting like last night happen before.  But I found out that most people have the potential for tuning in to "the other world" and neve do.  It has something to do with the environment - like they have to be in a place that's sending signals.
Well, what am I supposed to do?
I feel like a jerk.
Anything?
Disappointed?
It's gone now.
I'm afraid to go to sleep, I'm afraid to stay awake - I'm ruining your party. They're gonna put me away for sure.
Who, Jesse?
What's so funny?
So, school going alright?
I'm not taking drugs, Dad.  Can I go to bed now?
I got your invitation yesterday. Thanks.  Any cute guys gonna be there?
There's a Jesse on the phone.
We're going up to bed now.
Are you crazy?  You'll wake the whole neighborhood!
Well, I'm home now, so you can go right to sleep.  C'mon, angel.
Honey, you'll wake the whole neighborhood!
What are you still doing up?  It's past one.
What?
Good morning, Jennifer.
Horseshit.
What's happening?
I'm glad things have worked out for you.
When I was still a kid.  My folks got divorced.  After a while, I thought I'd imagined the whole thing.  I guess I didn't.
Are you okay?
He's gone.  It's over.  Please don't die, Nancy.  Please.
What are these, beauty marks?
Now who's gonna take the word of a crazy junkie chick like you?
Well, if it isn't my little girl... come to visit her Daddy.
I think we can stop him this time. Stop him for good.  But we need to know where the bones were hidden.
Anything?
This is nice.
Do you?  You told me they're survivors...and they are.  But how much longer they survive is up to us.
I can't believe I just did that.
To who?
The truth.
We made it.  Neil, we made it!
What are we going to do?
Nancy...
Oh Christ.  Simms put Kristen in the Quiet Room for the night.  They sedated her.
Neil, it's no use.  You saw how he is.
What'd you do, take the scenic route?
Okay, straight talk only in here.
What was that?
This wing's been closed for years.  What was this place?
My God.
Doesn't count.  You gotta say the words.
Why is he after us?
Mom and Dad?  That's...crazy.  They never said...
We're here.
Hi.
I wonder if you could tell me where the...?
What do you think of the guinea fowl?
That was such a great evening.
No!
God, that's an enormous arse.
Splendid.  I'm actually in the stock- market, so not really similar fields, though I have done some amateur stuff -- P.G. Wodehouse, you know -- farce, all that.  'Ooh -- careful there, vicar.'  Always imagined it's a pretty tough job, though, acting. I mean the wages are a scandal, aren't they?
No.  I better be going.  Thanks for your help.
I'm just a complete moron.  Sorry. This is the sort of thing that happens in dreams -- not in real life.  Good dreams, obviously -- it's a dream to see you.
Too complicated.
Nothing.
No, I didn't.
I don't think so.  No one has said 'whoopsidaisies,' do they -- I mean unless they're...
It's a disease I've got -- it's a clinical thing.  I'm taking pills and having injections -- it won't last long.
So who left who?
Hi.  Can I come in?
'Message from command.  Would you like them to send in the HKs?'
Eleven.
Actually, Mel does his own ass work. Why wouldn't he?  It's delicious.
Today has ben a good day.  Which under the circumstances is... unexpected.
Oh please sod off.
Well...
Rita Hayworth used to say -- 'they go to bed with Gilda -- they wake up with me.' Do you feel that?
And remember -- Spike owes you an expensive dinner.  Or holiday -- depending if he's got the brains to get the going rate on betrayal.
You're right: of course, you're right. It's just that I've dealt with this garbage for ten years now -- you've had it for ten minutes.  Our perspectives are different.
But... wait... there are things to say.
But yesterday... that actor asked you who I was... and you just dismissed me out of hand... I heard -- you had a microphone... I had headphones.
Liar.  She hates surprises.  What are you ordering?
Does the girl have a name?
That's right.
Quickly, quickly -- talk very quickly what are you doing here with Anna Scott?
Yes.
Do you want to stay?
Good decision.  All actresses are mad as snakes.
Well, you know, anybody saying they want to go out with you is... pretty great... isn't it...
Yes.  What do you think?
Hi guys.  Oh holy fuck.
The phone number of Anna Scott's agent in London and her agent in New York. You can ring her.  You think about her all the time -- now you can ring her!
What do you think?  Good move?
Well, yes -- usually -- I'd just changed to go home -- but I thought I'd just deal with this final call.
I agree.
Pleased to meet you.  Did you like the film?
That's right -- Topol.
I suppose so.
But it's not for the shop.  It's for you.
Excuse me -- it's your mother on the phone.
I actually tried that tack -- but she said you said that before and it's been twenty-four hours, and her foot that was purple is now a sort of blackish color...
Max.  This is Anna.
Well?
I think you have forgotten...  what an unusual situation you have here -- to find someone you actually love, who'll love you -- the chances are... always miniscule.  Look at me -- not counting the American -- I've only loved two girls in my whole life, both total disasters.
Wait a minute -- I'm your brother and I don't know anything about this.
Ahm, look this is a very odd situation.  I'm a friend of Anna Scott's -- and she rang me at home the day before yesterday -- and left a message saying she's staying with you...
Yes, sir.  I have him in my mind.
No, sir.
Even he.  Hey, you couldn't help me with an incredibly important decision, could you?
Hey.
There never will be, you know, unless you actually clean your clothes.
Who were the ones you didn't write down from?
Which was?
Try 'Flintstone.'
I'll talk to you in the morning.
I went out in my goddamn underwear too.
No -- they're... for my grandmother. She's in a hospital nearby.  Thought I'd kill two birds with one stone.
Excuse me.
We've got a security camera in this bit of the shop.
The one down your trousers.
At the close of Friday's meeting, we were discussing Mister Harding's problem, concerning his wife...  Mister Harding stated that his wife made him uneasy because she drew stares from men on the street. Is that correct, Mister Harding?
Am I to take it that there isn't a man among you who has an opinion concerning this matter?  Mister Harding, you've stated on more than one occasion that you suspected your wife of seeing other men.
Tell us about it...
Mister McMurphy. Patients aren't allowed in here.
Well, say, how 'bout easin' it down a bit so a man don't have to shout!
That's all right, Miss Pilbow, if Mister McMurphy does not wish to take his medication orally, he may...
You mean to tell me you're gonna count those old birds over there?
Yeah, ya should've come along with us, Miss Ratched, an' gotten a little sun on your cheeks and maybe caught a fish or two.
Welcome back.
Yeah, that'll do for openers!
That's okay, kid...
What we're gonna have to do is pull this ballclub together for our next play. 'Kay!
Your horses are hungry, That's what she did say, Come sit down beside me, An' feed them some hay. My horses ain't hungry, They wontt eat your hay-ay-aeee...
'K-Kay, M-Mack!
Ahhh, Billy...
Say... God Bless America!
Ya like that, Chief, huh?
In there.
I'm leaving. Goodbye!
They must be up there!
It's the questions she asks.
Mine, too!
Lobotomy!
You're fuckin' A-right, I am!
What's your plan, Mack?
Hey, Harding, wake me in an hour.
Gimme a cigarette!
Why not?
Yeah, buddy?
Bet a nickel!
Yeah, but you know how society persecutes a dedicated man.
Good, good, and how are you getting along on the ward?
Come on, Doc, you must be kiddin'.
Jesus, that old nurse sure wants my ass in a sling, don't she!
Your medicine, Mister McMurphy.
It's just medication, Mister McMurphy, good for you. Now down it goes...
What's troubling ya, buddy?
Put your money where your mouth is, Taber.
Out. It's the way out. So just keep it in your minds if ya ever wanna make use of it.
Oh yeah...
I'll be very glad to show you around, Miss...
Yeah...
Who is he?
I thought I might donate it to the mess hall.
Yes, sir, I sure am gonna enjoy my stay here.
Ya know, I ain't never been in an institution of psychology before.
Make yourself at home, Mister McMurphy...
Don't know if I can hold it that long, Sam.
What kind of crap is that???
Hey, Billy, stop cryin'. You don't have to cry... You ain't got nothin' to be ashamed of. She ain't gonna tell you mother... stop crying...
What are these men doing up wandering around?
Oh, that. That ain't nothin' to be afraid of, ma'am. Just ol Chief Bromden. That's all...
You better believe it, you sweet little thing. You better believe it...
She was your sister.
May I see your boarding pass, please?
Great.  Because, like I said, until you find it, we can't let you on the plane.
You didn't have that with you before.  Prima non l'aveva con se.
She's trying to find out where she can rent a loudspeaker.
Were they pen pals?
What?...
Oh, right.  Dwayne.  You're engaged to Dwayne?
Who's dying?
And, he's a friend of yours.  It's Dwayne.
A very large pig.
Yeah, but, what if he doesn't live here?  Like, what if he's a cannibal in New Guinea or something?
Larry!  What are you doing here?  Mom sent you.
Larry, can I borrow your car keys?
Don't worry, it's a long story, but I know who he is.  I know where to find him.
It was the moth stuff that gave it away, didn't it?  I knew that was too much.
Damon Bradley...
Uh-- in case Dwayne wants to try to reach you.
Venice?  I love Venice.  With the boats, right?...
Yes?!  To be married, I suppose.
He wants to marry me, doesn't he?
So?
Why not?
I went back to that restaurant and I spoke with his waiter, just on an off chance, you know, and, anyway-- he knew the name of the guy's hotel.  So, I called there, they said he left yesterday.  But, apparently he comes here every year, always follows the same route.  He always goes from here down the coast to the Le Sirenuse hotel in Positano.  I called.  And they told me he's checked in.
Uh, I'd rather not say.
He's out by the pool right now.
So.  You found him.
Why are you doing this?
Promise me you won't leave without saying goodbye.
Hi.
Thank you.  So, since I have a few more days of vacation left, I was wondering if maybe you'd want to do something sometime.  I mean, you know, if you don't have... other plans.
You can't come to Southern Italy and not see the Blue Grotto.
I don't know what you're talking about.  Who told you that?
Yes.  I'm crazy.  You have driven me crazy.  No one in their right mind would go to this much trouble to win over someone as insane as you.  Did it ever, even for one second, occur to you how much work it was to set all this up?  How many arrangements had to be made? How many players had to be coordinated?
Look, I just thought if you finally got rid of this obsession with this name, if you could get it out of your system once and for all, then maybe you'd be able to stop waiting and open your heart to someone real.  Granted, ideally, me.  I didn't do it to hurt you.  I did it for you.  I did it for us...
I'll look forward to it.
Sure.
What looks good?
So, what are we waiting for?
What about that guy you work with, Mike what's-his-name?
Is everything okay?
But somebody wrote those songs.
What's he do?
But one day you wake up and realize you've been had.  Of course life isn't like the movies.  That's why there are movies.
Let me tell you something about love.  There are no prince charmings, there are no glass slippers.  Love is hard work.
Is that bad?...
I can't believe we did this.  Do I have to remind you that your wedding is in six days?
No, I haven't.  And you forgot about the fortune teller.
Thank you so much.
I keep it in the glove compartment in case of emergencies.
Now what do we do?
This is a Lifestyles hotel.
I just got a dial tone--
A phone message.  Only--
Couldn't we just have taken a train?
I'm hungry.
You think he misses me at all?
Anna, I'm Faith.  You don't know how happy I am to meet you.  You see, I'm trying to find someone, and--
And then what, Faith?
No... Like a psychiatrist.
Sightseeing...  What're you doing?
Why do they read kids fairy tales in the first place?  Children are very impressionable, you know.
I thought you were the one who didn't think I should've come in the first place.
He's a jerk.
So...
A porco?
Huh?
Uh, yeah.  Sure.  Honey, did you forget the guys are coming over tonight?
Don't call me doll, Larry.  I hate it when you call me doll.
I came after the woman I love.
It was an emergency.  I only lied that night because it was the only way I knew to stop her.  I knew if I didn't, I'd never see her again.
And then I saw her.  And all I know is, when I looked in her eyes I saw something... light.  And life and passion and yearning.  And something else I can't even put my finger on, something I'd never seen before--
I'm gonna take her home first.
And what in blazes have the nuns got to do with it?
When he got up and chased them they thought it was a dead man coming after them.
I make it twentysix twenty-three. You're fifty short, Skins.
But my own kid bro-
You said they was only going to talk to him.
Come on, kid. I'll buy you a drink.
Gee, Charley, I'm sure glad you stopped by for me. I needed to talk to you. What's it they say about blood, it's- 
Mm-hmmm.
I always figured I'd live longer without it.
Ten cents a hundred pounds on everything that moves in and out. And you don't have to lift a finger. It'll be three-four hundred a week just for openers.
You don't mean you're thinking of testifying against- 
What the hell!!!
I tell you, Charley, I haven't made up my mind!
It was you, Charley... .
Don't turn away! Look at it! You're in this too- don't you see, don't you see? You're in this too, Father.
I'd better go in.
Thanks anyway.
What for?
I like pigeons. You send a bird five hundred miles away he won't stop for food or water until he's back in his own coop.
If another fella tries to take that perch away from him, he lets him have it.
Listen, you like beer?
No thanks... .
A dive? You mean, into the water?
Now what are you doing?
Why, Terry, who said it was?
His- racket?
I- I'd like to, Edie, but-  -there's nothin' I can do. Edie feels subdued, ashamed at breaking down. She rises, and in a low voice says-
You haven't finished your beer.
Edie, listen, stay out of this mess. Quit tryin' to ask things about Joey. It ain't safe for you.
It's true.
Edie!
I've been sittin' in the church.
I had to, Edie. I had to see you.
That-  -word again! Why do you keep saying conscience, conscience... .
My hand.
Thanks just the same.
But I feel like- My friends won't talk to me.
Am I on my feet...?
A look in his eyes! Hold your hats, brother, here we go again. You think he's one of those cases you're always draggin' in and feelin' sorry for. Like the litter of kittens you had-the only one she wants to keep has six toes and it's cockeyed to boot. Look at him. The bum! And the crush you had on that little Abyssinian... .
Six-toed cats. Assyrians. Abyssinians. It's the same difference. Well don't think this Terry Malloy is any six-toed cockeyed Assyrian. He's a bum. Charley and Johnny Friendly owned him when he was a fighter and when they ring the bell he still goes into action.
But you're the one I want to tell- what you said over Nolan- about keepin' silent when you know the score- I'm guilty- you hear me? I'm guilty... .
I don't get it!
I want to see you, Terry.
Now don't give me a hard time.
Your gun.
Nice fellows.
What do you think?
You can bring a lawyer if you wish. And you're privileged under the Constitution to protect yourself against questions that might implicate you in any crimes.
I guess it's pretty tough work at that.
I think you could have.
Well, I better get going. Hit those stairs again.  Was that a looping right or an uppercut the first time you caught him?
Condolences. How you fixed for cabbage this mornin'?
I ought to belt you one, J.P.
... .and you'll tell Johnny Friendly.
What's the matter wit' you, success gone to ya head?
Didn't you recognize him, dopey. That's Old Man Doyle.
Boy, you must've been up early.
Better.
Is Johnny in?
Give me a double.
Yeah? Must be Danny-boy. I lost him in the last race.
H'ya, slugger, how they hangin'?
-Do you?
You come from Green Point? Go back to Green Point. You don't work here no more.  Here, kid, here's half a bill. Go get your load on.
He don't, huh?  Well, he knows thirty-nine pages worth of our operation.
You know what I mean. Leave her alone.
Tippi-tippi-tim, tippi-tim, Tippi-tippi-tan, tippi-tan...  Gotta dime for a crippled-up docker?
I was afraid one bottle might get lonely by itself.  Now you see the advantage of a little man in a big coat.
But does it have to be in a cemetery?
Well we certainly can't stay here. C'mon.
What can we do?
Easy Shirley, Easy!  Panic won't do us any good!  Let me think. We've got to stall for time.
<i>Him!</i>  I'll bet he sleeps with all the lights on.
She was?
I suppose most of the others will have to wait for their judgement until after the next full moon.
Well?
The <b>moon</b> is almost <b>gone!</b>
The time...is short.
They are live ones?
There are one or two which should complement the night's entertainment, Master
Did you do something to get us into trouble again?
What happened to Mandrake the Magician?
You were <i>both</i> in the trunk?  Together?
I'll say one thing for Jack, he was never ugly or mean, or drank too much. He was very considerate, lights on or off, if you know what I mean.
That wasn't Jack's fault.  No, that was on account of Buddy, for some reason, decided to call his sister and confess to a job <u>before</u> they'd done it instead of after.  She called the FBI and they both went down, ended up at Lompoc.  I think Buddy felt kinda bad about that.
Ask him his name.
You're good.
I talk to the guy you work for, Emil. He tole me your number and where you live.  See, I'm looking for an assistant and would like to speak to you.
Go away, or I'll call the police.
We may as well leave her, we're leaving the car and we gotta leave her some place anyway, what's the difference where?
Jack?
So call her up.  Tell her don't talk to any Cubans.
And you know they're gonna have some people watching the hotel.
You at least bring the gun?
I guess Adele's in good hands.
First thing we do, we get to Detroit, we find Glenn, then we find a window to throw him out of.
Whatta you think?
How long you talk to her?
How long were you with the girl?
I mean, they don't know for sure he's dead.  Look, there's always a chance we'll walk out've there with nothing.  I say let fate decide.
So what's that mean?  That you're disappointed by what you found or you're sorry you robbed all those banks?
You know they gonna set us up.
There's still time, take me up on my offer.
They look like plain old rocks.
Come <i>on</i>.
Isn't that my report you're holding onto?
This fella holds you hostage, you talk about movies?
Daniel.  Listen --
I'm at Adele Delisi's.
Oh, I was just wondering, if I were to bring in Chirino, would you put me on the task force?
Yes or no, Daniel.  If I get him, will you let me go after Foley?
You're primary, you're secondary, you're point man.
Now you see Foley and this guy Bragg come in behind us, whatta you do?
Put it down or I'll shoot.
Daniel Burdon, please.  Karen Sisco.
You want, I tole you you can come. You all right, Foley.  I like you.
You see what they doing, those posts out there?  Putting up another fence, five metres on the other side of the one that's there.  We wait until Super Bowl Sunday, they could have the second fence built and we have to dig another nine, ten days.  So we going soon as it's dark.  You want -- I mean it -- you can still come.
Who was the friend?
Karen, I told you not to--
Sign says "Shut the fuck up."  Or can't you guys read?
Himey here's a pro-toh-jay of mine. He's ranked number thirty-two in the federal prison system.
What's the matter with right here? It's nice and warm.
Who's sitting here?
That what they're wearing these days to break and enter?
Jack, you don't use a gun, do you?
Nervous?
Why you're just a girl.  What do you do for a living you pack a shotgun?
Boy, it stunk in there.
If they get set up in time, which I doubt.  And even if they do they'll be looking for a buncha little Latin fellas, not a big black guy driving a Ford.
Who, Buddy?  Yeah.  He's a good guy. Back when we jailed together, he'd call his sister every week without fail.  She's a born-again Christian, does bookkeeping for a televangelist. Buddy calls her up, confesses his sins, tells her about whatever bank he happened to rob.
So, what's <u>your</u> name?  It'll be in the paper tomorrow anyway.
You don't seem all that scared.
You're sure easy to talk to.  I wonder -- say we met under different circumstances and got to talking, say you were in a bar and I came up to you -- I wonder what would happen.
I mean, romantically.
You know who this is?
None of your business.
That's my dad.
Let's see.  You could come on by my dad's place, drop 'em off.
There's a guy here on the task force right now.  Maybe I should put him on the phone, let you two work it out.
My dad's retired.  He was a Private Investigator.  Forty years.  I used to work for him.
I hear he didn't mean to.  The cop fell as Dillinger was aiming at his leg and got him through the heart.
You were going to see her?
So she did help you?
You're not dumb.
Come on, Jack -- don't.
Detroit.  Snoopy Miller told me uncut diamonds are as easy to move as cash.
Take your sunglasses off.
Wait in the car.
What happened to your shades?  Someone finally step on 'em?
I thought you guys were busted.
You're smart, Ripley, you'll tell this guy to fuck off.
Tell me something, Jack, how much longer you in here?
It's a little late for me.
Today, I'm offering you a lousy job at a lousy wage.  You think you're better than that?  Fine.  Show me.  Show me that you're really willing to change and we'll talk about something better. A lot better.  But first, Jack, you gotta earn it.
Jesus Christ, what the hell are you doing here?  What's going on?  Who's upstairs?
Good God... they're shooting Midge!
I can't believe you're still angry with me, Jack, after all this time.
Dumbfuck Glenn was right, there's about five million worth in there, wouldn't you say, Richard?
I were you, I'd get up and run.
You busted out?
And how long was it before they caught up with you?
The <u>ninth</u>?
And so now you're off to Glades.
For the car, for aiding and abetting a prison escape, and conspiring to do whatever you came here for.
You want to get out of here, run, it'll warm you up.
Snoopy.  Glenn Michaels.
I can't really go into it right now. I'll just tell you it's someone big.
Wait a minute.  I'm letting <i>you</i> in on this, not all your friends.
Walk in a house with me, do this cross- dressin' nigga named Eddie Solomon I used to sell to been dealin' on his own.
I can tell.
What's wrong with you?
Here?  In this house?
Can't.  I gotta drive out to Glades, then I'm meeting Ray Nicolet at ten.
"Hey, yourself."
Remember, pay attention to how she talks about Foley, her tone.  Do it right, she'll tell you things she wouldn't tell Burdon.  Tell her you think he's a nice guy.  No, first tell her about being in the trunk with him, in the dark for half an hour, and see how she takes it.  If she's in on it, what does she get for all the aggravation; cops breathing on her?  I bet nothing.  So she still likes him enough to stick her neck out.  You think that's possible?  What kind of guy is he?
But you know he's dirty and you still wanna see him again.
You like the wild ones, don't you? Tillman, Nicolet and now Foley.  You know, I've always said there's a thin line between the cowboy cops and the armed robbers, all those guys that love to pack.
Buddy's sister Regina Mary Bragg got two calls from Buddy up in Detroit this morning, called Burdon.  She's also the one gave Burdon Buddy's address.
So what I want to know is why Buddy still calls his sister every week even after she turned him in.
You gonna go get him?
I was just thinking... you could have a nice time with him on the plane -- like picking up where your interlude, or whatever you call it, left off. And then throw him in the can.
Where's Ripley's safe at, he keep his valuables in.
In case no one knows what he does. Tell me, Ray, you ever wear one says, "Undercover"?
Yeah, someone spotted two of 'em in this hobo camp out by the airport, called the number--
...She fixes him pork chops and rice, the next thing you know they're making love on the sofa.  She says he was very gentle.
The woman also said he stole her husband's gun, a twenty-two pistol, and some of his clothes.
That Bausch & Lomb Saline shit you asked for is gonna be eighty bucks.
Excuse me.  Snoopy?  Did we settle the fish thing?
Midge.
We have a problem here?
White Boy, how much is the reward on the man again?
We'll ask Evelyn.  Evelyn?  Evelyn!
You know the football player, Red G- Grange?  Well the guys called me R-Red, cause you know, I'm red...and they thought I was strange, so, you know, Red G-Grange, Red Str-Strange.
Good on you, then, Rafe McCawley.  We'll get you situated in some quarters, and then introduce you to the equipment you'll be flying.
You'll love it.  No base, no bars, just lots of sun and aircraft maintenance.
Too late for apologies, Walker.
Hey.  You.  Mr. Coma.
Rafe's girl, Evelyn?
Ever hear of mai-tai's?  Comes in a big...pot.  Like...like...
I th-think I'm gonna like it here.
You'd always go sit in a plane whenever you were upset.
Waitress!  Four beers!
I understand how it could happen.  I know why any guy would love her.  And I can't blame you that it happened.  You thought I was dead, she was grieving, you were trying to help her.
It's tight.
I'm out of ammo!
Fun today.  Like old times.
What do you mean?  I'm just doing what we've always done.
We've always tried to beat each other.
Maybe just trying to measure up.
Broomsticks instead of tail guns.
Rafe's folks had a crop dusting business, owned their own planes.  Real straight, frugal.  My father was the town drunk. Went to sleep one night on the railroad tracks and was still there when the Dawn Express came along.  Rafe and I were the only ones at the funeral.  He took me back to his house, and I never left.
Sorry.
C-Colonel, we been p-practicing takeoff's, but I ain't sure we can land on these carriers d-decks.
Then wh-where do we land?
There are some people who think the outside loop is reckless and irresponsible.
Good luck over there McCawley.  I admire your decision.
Well sure, Colonel --
What's your name?
What do you get for winning?
You take care, Dorie.
Whatever you're trying to tell me isn't good, is it.  Or it wouldn't be so hard to say.
I sent telegrams, I guess the military traffic held them up.
I called my folks, then Colonel Doolittle.  The Colonel sent a man to pick me up.  They wanted to debrief me. I told the Colonel I needed to see somebody first, and he had a supply flight heading out in an hour.  I've done a lot of talking.  You haven't said anything.
If we launch the third wave and annihilate their fuel depots, we destroy their ability to operate in the Pacific for at least a year!
We have bombed Tokyo, Mr. President. Radio Tokyo interrupted it's own broadcast to make the announcement.
Leapin' Jesus!
You have something to say, Yamamoto?
It's gonna rain again. Every time I wash the car, it rains.
I may be an old fool, but I think we can help you.
But I want you and Scott to understand.  Do you think he loves Janet? Maybe he's smashed too many fortune cookies.
I feel ridiculous. Maybe I should go home and change.
You just have to remember... men are like houses and trade upwards... I thought you had a pretty good marriage.
The only one?
They're waiting. Come on.
He is kind of cute, isn't he?
Okay. But let's have a girls night soon. Maybe a pajama party.
Can you believe I want to marry that dork.
Well, today's Saturday and it's still not here.
You don't want them? They're going to make a big comeback any minute. Mark my words, these lamps are going to...
It's not going to be forever. I figure three years is long enough. I can see it the music pans out.  And right after graduation we should start seeing other people. Kind of comparison shop before we settle down and get married. Know what I mean?
Well, we got the prom coming up, all these parties. We shouldn't upset our parents?
Looking good out there.
Right. I promised my mother.
Charlie, how are you?
Mmm. This is nice.  I always loved the way you kiss.  I missed you.
You really love me, don't you?
Charlie, let's make love.
A lot's happened since last weekend.
Charlie. I just had the strangest dream.
What are you doing here?
I will be happy if I have you. I love you.
What! What about the group and my singing career? What about me?
What're you doing here?
Stop being defensive. I want to help you. I wrote a song for you.
Does this mean you like me again?
Don't be ridiculous! They're just a bunch of harmless old men. My grandfather was in there.
What do you mean you and my father decided? Who the hell are you to plan my life? Let's get married and live happily ever after. Bullshit. I got knocked up. I had to marry you. I never had a choice.
I loved you since the day I met you, and I haven't stopped.
Terry, slow down.
It was my idea, Grandma. I always wondered what went on at those lodge meetings.
Coffee and a donut.
This is great reefer.
Now listen, this is the plan. As soon as school is finished we go to Utah and...
I don't see the humor in this. Go to your room immediately. You're grounded.
Dad, I never knew you had a sense of humor.
Thank you.. I accept your apology with the hope that what went on yesterday will never happen again.
Damn that Charlie I
Quiet today?
A new car. We can't afford a new car.
I have a note.
I'm excused.
Sort of.
Yes, he's fine, too. You saw them at Easter.
Charlie's downstairs. Why aren't you ready?
Where have you been?
It's unbelievable. The man never ages.
I have to talk to you. It's very important.
What a great kite.
I want to ask you a question.  Do you think...time travel is possible?
And then, there's Richard's Burrito.
That's my own theory based on a Mexican food called the burrito. I had it once when my parents took me to Disneyland.
But when did you leave? Are you here until then? Were you there until now? What direction are you going in? Are you a moving point on an infinite line extending into the past? Can anyone do it?
You're a molecule in chaos, a discontinuent aberration. Maybe you've just got powers of precognition. Well, maybe you're just out of whack.
The way I see it, you have an unparalleled opportunity to become the richest woman in the world.
I'm curious, but I don't want to know. Jeez, I hope you haven't been telling people what's going to happen to them.
You're taking advantage of a minor.
The wave of the future! I've decided on our first fortune! I'll see you later. You just think high tech.
What do you know about hypnosis?
Look, I'm desperate. I'll try anything. But what if you can't snap me out of it?
You are completely relaxed. When I count to three, you will open your eyes. One... two... three.  We'll start with something easy. What is your name?
Oh boy. Peggy, what are microchips?
That's just perfect isn't it? Did it work? Did you find out why I came back?
I came to say goodbye.
Yeah, yeah. I'm taking a big gamble. I've loved him for a long, long time.
No! No! No! Peggy Sue got married! Case closed. I don't want to marry anybody. Goodbye Richard.
Did she always have reporters following her around like this?
What?
You took over for Doctor Yolander?
Out?
Just out.
Not that much appreciation. I thought we were gonna tone down that flabby ass.
What's his name?
I've never seen anybody punch Clyde before.
Drew, I know your dog died, but... get a grip, man, you're freaking me out.
What was that all about? You think he's trying to scare us?
I gotta go back and do my chores...
Yes!
Do you really think so, Andy?
Thanks, Walter.
Excuse me, Charles. With all due respect... this is... preposterous! It doesn't make any sense, it sounds as if we're talking about someone else. Pardon the lack of humility, but I've had the distinct impression I was kind of... one of the rising stars around here. And I feel that wasn't just my imagination. And I also think I deserve to know what's really going on here, Charles.
Why are you getting dressed?
Jerk... What did you say?
We're not skipping this treatment.
Maybe I should start making plans, is that what you think? Start planning my memorial service? "Begin to prepare for the inevitable."
What's that mean?!
Thanks, Charles.
Thanks for coming in.
We've been talking it over, Andy. Your future that is... We feel that, because we respect you so much, we have to be honest with you.
You can save it for the jury, Charles. I want to hear you say, under oath, in front of a judge and a jury, I'm a bad lawyer.  Gentlemen.  Counselor.
Congratulations.
I misplaced an important complaint. That's their story. Want to hear mine?
I was diagnosed with AIDS eight months ago. During a bout of pneumonia. I recovered quickly and was back at work in ten days. Since I was doing so well on the AZT, we decided against telling anyone about it.
Okay... They want you out. It's against the law to fire you for having AIDS, so they make you look like a fuck up. Which leads us to the mysterious, lost file.
I knew you were going to say that. I don't buy it, and I don't see a case.
Thanks for your time.
One more thing, Your Honor...
He was... the kind of person I thought I wanted to be.
Obviously, at this time, you weren't sick.
Are you a good lawyer?
What do you call a thousand lawyers chained together at the bottom of the ocean?
You'd <u>heard</u> of AIDS in 1984, 85?
While you were employed at Wyant Wheeler, you did everything you could to make sure no one knew you were an active homosexual, correct?
Yes.
And it's your contention, that when the partners were made aware of the lesions, they jumped to the conclusion you had AIDS and fired you.
What's Dr. Gillman say?
No. Have you ever felt discriminated against, at Wyant Wheeler?
In what way?
Leave that.
Unprotected sex with a prostitute.
Okay, Mr. Laird. Explain this to me like I'm a four year old: Did Andrew Beckett win your lawsuit for you or not?
You're the asshole, buddy.
Your Aunt Teresa is gay? That beautiful, sensuous woman is a... <u>lesbian</u>?
And the way they work out, pumping up, so they can be macho and faggot at the same time... I can't <u>stand</u> that shit. Now I'm being totally honest with you.
Don't know, Joe.
Have you changed your aftershave?
Okay, so... help me with this one, Joe... Is it disgusting for someone to put his dick into someone's mouth? Or, is it disgusting for someone to take a dick into <u>their</u> mouth?
Yeah. Do I have a case?
Not when I was in the Navy.
Yeah. But we took care of him.
You taught him a lesson.
I've discovered something interesting, Charles.
What? What is it?
You came for us....
Probably okay to talk to me now.
Oh, Lord....
Liquid oxygen canisters inside. Start ripping them out. Quick hits only -- try to make it last.
What whispers?
Where are the sand-cat tracks? Why aren't we still following them?
<u>I trusted you</u>, Riddick. Goddamn, I trusted that some part of you wanted to rejoin the human race.
They're already dead. Get on board.
'Course I am -- but doesn't mean I won't leave you here. If you believe anything about me, better be that.
Just give me your hand.
Amazing. I'm Johns.
And him?
We just keep him locked up forever?
S'matter?
A very good sign.  That's Riddick's direction. You do <u>not</u> wanna be caught in the dark with this guy.
Hey. You can tell me, Carolyn.
So now you know.
Sorry. Thought I heard something.
Well, don't ask me to.
Nobody else is going down but me, okay?
What, you think I'm doin' this to prove something?
Little ratty-ass.
Rag it, Riddick. Nobody wants your theories on --
Wait for what? Until it's so dark we can't even find our way back to --
Okay, maybe that's a <u>good</u> thing. Maybe I can use him to help with --
Oh, this is a dangerous game you're playing, Johns.
Stop it, stop it, STOP IT!
Look, we gotta think about everyone now -- the kid especially. How scared is she gonna be out there?
He'll lead you over the first cliff. You know that, don't you?
You give him the cells and the ship -- and he will leave you. He will leave you all out there to die.
We cannot go through there....
Well? Is it just the pump?
I mean, I mean, chrono shows we're 22 weeks out, so gravity wasn't supposed to kick in for another 19. I mean, I mean, I mean, why did I fall <u>at all</u>?
Look, Fry. Company says we're responsible for every one of those --
Some prophet guy?
Hasan?
Imam. Slow down.
Don't stop, just slow down.  Little more space 'tween us and them.
Where's Mr. Johns?
We got you...it's okay, it's okay...we got you now....
Six of us left. If we could get through that canyon and lose just one, that'd be quite a fucking feat, huh? A good thing, right?
Look, it's hellified stuff -- but no different than those battlefield doctors when they have to decide who lives and who dies. It's called "triage," okay?
Then let's not name the Thanksgiving turkey, okay? I assume you still got a shiv.
An' this?
How did you know we'd come here?
I ask you to reconsider the rash course you've taken. If you're convicted of heresy, the most you'll get is two years. But if you persist in pointing guns in my direction, you'll hang for high treason.
Nothing much. The remnants of a life raft. Maybe a small flag. The emblem of my countrymen.
When are you going to show me what's in the cave?
If there's any shooting, Dr. Zaius, you'll be the first to die. Depend on it.
Taylor, I'd rather you -
They can't convict us of that. You proved our innocence. Besides...  ... his culture is our culture.
Do you have to work tonight?
Cornelius, why do you insist on provoking him?
Oh, Cornelius, show some strength!
Got your sensors?
Geiger counter?
One pistol... twenty-four rounds of ammo. two medical kits.. one camera... one TX9.  We've enough food and water for three days.
Nothing will grow here .... there's just a trace of hydrocarbons, and most of the nitrogen is locked into nitrates.
Taylor -- quit riding him.
Where there's one there's another. And another. And another.
Which one was wearing the strange clothes?
But the quota system's been abolished! You made it. Why can't I?
State your case, Mr. Prosecutor.
He can reason? With the Tribunal's permission, let me expose this hoax by direct examination.
Yes, sir. The State charges Doctors Zira and Cornelius with contempt of this Tribunal, malicious mischief and scientific heresy.
Good morning, Dr. Zira.
Landon! Send a last signal.
It's no use ... there she goes.
Well? Where are we? Have any notion, skipper?
Because time has wiped out everyone and everything you cared for -- they're dust.
Who are you?
Gorilla hunters ...
What is that?
And our purpose is to settle custodial and jurisdictional questions concerning this beast, and determine what's to be done with him.
It says here that his name is Bright Eyes. You gave him that name yourself.
Sustained. In all fairness, Dr. Zira, you must admit the accused is a nonape, and therefore has no rights under ape law.
'I have come to you from a planet in a different solar system. I am an explorer in space, with no hostile intentions against your civilization. On my planet it was the primate Man who evolved Into a thinking animal, while the apes remained..."
What about me?
Because you're not unique. There was the one you call Landon --
Stop right there.
There is no contradiction between faith and science. True science.
What is your proposal?
Twelve hundred years ago.
Tell him to pull back!
Then answer this: If ran was superior, why didn't he survive?
Well, Bright Eyes, is our throat feeling better?
What is this?
You! ... You knew about this?
Listen-
Cornelius and I have been indicted for heresy. Unless we can prove our theories, we don't stand a chance of acquittal.
Actually, you're a different breed. This creature will never evolve.
You want her that much?
Dr. Zira, I'd like to kiss you good-bye.
He's moving his fingers!
Wouldn't it more properly be done in your office?
But how convenient that the proof of his arrival has vanished?  You also state that Bright Eyes had two intelligent companions at the time of his capture.
Bunker...
Blood trail just keeps going and going but no body.
Listen to that shit, that's good shit!
You lame Taylor?
La Dai! La Dai! GET THE FUCK OUTTA THERE!
Hey Taylor, you okay man?
Barnes got it in for you, don't he?
Excuses are like assholes, Taylor - everybody got one.
What are you talking about! 
He done a year in Japan in the hospital, then when he gets out, the first thing he done is re-up. Four years he been in the field...
Well he ain't normal that's fo sure.
How about taking to Uncle Larry into the old firm? He's a useful guy to have on your side.
Betty, this is Margo West. She wants to meet you. Miss Mayfield.
A fellow named Brandon has a penthouse here. He's holding open house. I was up there. Too noisy. Bored.
Brandon. Clark Brandon. Fellow about my age. Lot of money... that he didn't make. Former American. Now naturalized in Canada. Social standing indeterminate. Manners not quite perfect. Scotch superb.
Why not?
He's a fellow with a very hard knee, and he knows how to use it.
There's a lot of water between Vancouver and the U.S.A. This note is a suicide note.  After you're gone where would they look for you?  Why would they look for you? Darkness, and open water, and a fast cabin cruiser.  And I have a pocket full of money.  And if I helped you, I'd be committing a crime, or so they tell me.
Take me where I haven't the courage to take myself.
Blonde, beautiful, and sad--and nowhere.  Of course she might have run away--if she knew how.  And where to go.  She might have dyed her hair.  Bleached it before probably.  And changed her name again.  But look at this note.  And look at her room in the hotel. Her stuff is all there.  Hasn't a rag except what she stood up in. You don't run away like that.  Not if you are young and beautiful. No chance.
Including Killaine...I still can't think of you that way.
In a way.
It buys things, just like any other kind.
Mitchell was dead enough.
Would I want to?
You probably know the type. You find them in hotels and resorts all over the world. They always have clothes, and money, and usually have had three or four husbands. They dress and enamel themselves with great care. They worry a great deal about those little lines at the corner of the eyes.. And they demonstrate their incompetence at the art of living bet getting mixed up with people like Larry Mitchell.  Tell me about yourself, Miss Mayfield.
That's an evasion and you know it.
True. I was a bit irritable last night. I apologize.
But not in the investigation of a major crime, I hope.
This isn't a very good place to talk.
He looks at the girl, looks into her eyes--
Palm trees against a sunset--waves breaking on a coral reef--the Taj Mahal by moonlight--roses in an English garden, just after a shower--  Clich?s, one and all--but good ones, with a lot of mileage left in them--there's one thing he does not see--murder--and murder was what he was sent to find.  Pretty ridiculous, isn't it?
They call me Jeff.
Not quiet yet.  We know who the gun belonged to. Margo West.  She told us this morning.  It doesn't mean much.  Mitchell took it away from her.  He had a habit of going through her bag.
You've got a couple of hours, maybe.
I can't answer that.
What proper grounds?  You can't be in love with me.  You hardly know me.  I'm not in love with you.
But even if you were in love with me.
Good morning, Mr. Brandon.
And there's a Mr. Goble to see you. Says his business is personal.
I'd like a few words with you, in private.
Nice friendly approach you've got. Goble. I could hardly walk when I got out of bed this morning.
Private eye?
I go home and paint the kitchen.
I stick around and wait for the five hundred.
What'll you have, Margo?
All right, let's see the buzzer.
How are your teeth getting along?
How are you two getting along?
"Money is a sort of sixth sense that gives meaning to all the others." Very appealing, especially to a poor man.
I tried it once.  I lost my shirt.
I had a father who knew how to steal.
Hello, Mitchell. Having fun?
What are you doing here?
You nasty, sardonic--
Mr. Clarendon, have you ever seen this before?
The Harbor police have just picked up a dead man out of the water.
You have two murders to investigate. This man's head was beaten in. And there's nothing in his pockets.
I've been on the waterfront detail for twelve years.  This man hadn't been dead an hour.  He wasn't killed last night.  He was killed today. In broad daylight.  That's no drunk- rolling job.
And don't get too logical, Driscoll. In police business it doesn't work. I wish it did.  But it doesn't
Got a moment, Inspector?
If you'd seen the blood on his head--and some body had to carry him out to sea--
Send that?
Catch me at the Vancouver Royal if it's important.
I have an appointment with him, right here, right now.
It'll be a tough dollar when guys like you learn the alphabet.
Pearl-handled .25 Automatic, uh?  No, it's a Belgian gun... 6.6 mm.
Unless the gun was slanted up.
Right. A clean deduction from observed facts. They've got to be simple once in a while, Inspector.
That's pretty risky business, Inspector.
Was that about the right angle?
Assume there is something to hid. I go to a lot of trouble.  What do I do?  What would you do?
You can find out.
I've handled it.  Mitchell's handed it.  If I wipe it off, no suicide. If I take it out and lose it, no suicide.  If I leave it here....no suicide.
And she did give him the chance, the way it worked out.
What about me?
I shall. From your knowledge of Mitchell, would you say he would be likely to commit suicide?
Yes--and he's already becoming vague to me.  Funny!  Last night I was furiously jealous.  Jealous of what?  I out that gun in my bag deliberately.  Who was I going to kill with it?  A girl I didn't even know?  A man I knew to be a thief and a forger?  A half-man? A gigolo?  It's already ludicrous. Love!  What a comedy!
Yes, I think so.  Here are two glazed manila envelopes.  One is the bag type.  The other one had the money in it.  Don't ask me how I know.  I know.
Mayfield?  She fit into this?
Killaine, this is Mr. Mitchell, Senior.  Young Mitchell's father. He just flew in from Toronto.
Well, find out.  Who's covering her?
Ye have, have ye?
And in the meantime this girl goes where she pleases, does what she pleases?
"Superintendent J. Mckechnie, Vancouver Police Department. Vancouver B.c. Replaying To Your E.P. teletype classification No. 2684 incomplete.  We advise identification possible.  Elizabeth Kinsolving, arrested Greenwater, North Carolina, January 8, 1948, on a charge of murder.  Signed, FBI., Washington, D.C. H. Cleary, Inspector in charge."  Have ye any comment, Killaine?
I have a rough idea.
What'll we do about it, Margo?
I didn't mean it that way  I'm sorry.
I told you she's just..
My first husband worked for the BBC.  I doubt if anyone there remembers him now, just another long dead diligent administrator. He would have been useful in the fight to preserve the BBC's independence during the Suez crisis - one of the few things he was passionate about.  I became involved too.  I started work on a book that would have been published on the tenth anniversary of Suez. Then he died, and I loots the will to write it.  By the time I was over his death, other books had been published, and it wasn't worth going on.
It wasn't much more than a pot boiler.Suez was very important for our generation.  I didn't want it to be forgotten.  And that's why I'd like to be able to help you. But really Mr. Penfield, I looked through my notes before you came, they're all very much out of date, there's been so much published since.  I don't think I'm your man.
Since you are a friend of my daughter's, I think I'm entitled to call you James, don't you think?
To Ann.
History books are first onto the bonfires.
The references are to Hansard or to newspapers.  I haven't got the actual speeches now.  You'll have to chase them up.
Then I began to listen to what the well-off were saying about the poor now - the war had just ended, and the language was much the same as it had been before the first Reform Act.  A small minority thought that England was really theirs, they had made it, they owned it.  The rest, the wage earners, were foreigners, outsiders intent on wrecking it all.
Thank you.
Are you going to have coffee?
And you'll join me in a sambucca?
James... I can't begin to tell you how pleased we all are.  Congratulations, and I really mean it.
Can I give you a lift?
What did you think of that Wadja film?
I thought it was tremendous.
Oh, but he was terrific.
Mummy and I, we were more like lovers, really, or sisters.  Then a couple of years after Daddy died, and not long after I left Oxford, she started seeing various men and I was furious.  I really was upset. I stopped going home.  I never phoned.  I went round telling everyone how awful her books were. And she hardly seemed to notice, and that made me angrier.  Then I got a job I was interested in, and I started to see lots of men, and I suppose I grew up a little and began to understand.  So I wrote her a long letter, almost seven pages, saying how sorry I was, and how I was worried that we were drifting apart.  And do you know, she wrote me a poem, a really beautiful poem about mothers and daughters.
Damn.  They're early.
Why not stay?
Me too.
Look, will you come on a walk with me tomorrow?
Might?
You approve!
She's never written a book in it, but she clearly knew a lot.
It's obvious what you have to do. Your way into the daughter's pants is through the mother, up the Suez canal...
Delivering gossip and goodwill. It seems we'll both be doing Brighton.  Perhaps you should come too.
Six onion bajees!  Great girl.  Did you shake the mother off?
Big mistake, I think.  You might have learned a lot.
And you were obviously getting nowhere with her.  I was waiting for the right moment to tell you that.
It might have worked.  Really.  I would have been delighted for you if it had.  But she wasn't interested.  Not my fault.
It's that lady from Norfolk again.
Hello, Jimmy.
So how is she?
Now, are you going to have some more tea?
Ploughman's Lunch.  Traditional English fare.
Don't point it at James!
We'll see what we can do.
Football's a man-made game.  You keep score with numbers.  But in this, there's no field, no rules, no opponent.  Just you and the wave.
The only way to win out here is to surrender.  You have to feel what the wave is doing, accept its energy, get in sync.  Just feel it all moving in the blackness... you don't need to see.
It's a little ceremony we always have at the end of summer.  One last speedstar.
Don't screw around man, pull it!
Three seconds... two... one...
Yeah?  What?
You know less than nothing.  If you even knew that you knew nothing, at least that would be something, but you don't.
That's right.  And we nailed over a thousand of them.  We did it by crunching data.  Good crime-scene work, good lab work, good data-base analysis.  Nobody had to tackle a car once.  You getting the signal, special agent?
What?
Look, Harp.  Don't turn him over to the uniforms like some punk.  Let me ride him in.
Harp, let me tell you something.  I was an agent in this bureau when your mommy was still wiping your shinny pink ass, and you know one thing I learned in all those years that you still haven't?
Yeah.  What's your theory?
Johnny, it's the only way.
... Felony B and E, three months in juvey.  Better.  Felony assault. Postgraduate work at Chino. Excellent.  I'm lovin' it.  What about the brother?  Great!  Another model citizen. These guys really fit the profile.
I'm ready to rock, Angelo.  Where you want me?
Aw shit.
I say we call it in.  Get some backup.  But you gotta do it.  Harp won't listen to me.
Angelo!  Don't fire!
I can see that.  But forget it. Stick to tennis, or whatever you're good at.  Miniature golf.  Here, your number's 37.
Nice place.
Who's the girl?
Look at you.
Well, usually you have this sort of intense scowl of concentration, like you're doing this for a school project or something... I don't know, like something's driving you.  See, it's gone.  If I didn't know better I'd say you looked almost happy.
Ouch.
So what'd the other guy look like?
Wasn't my style. We're a rescue unit, not assassins.  This must be good. Big shot from the CIA, leaves his desk to come back to the bush. What's so important?
You don't know how much I missed this, Dutch!!! Once you get this in your blood, you never get it out!!!
Billy's on it.  Heat seeker. Pretty sophisticated for half-asses mountain boys.
I knew this man. Green Berets, out of Fort Bragg. What the hell were they doing in here? You got any answers for this, Dillon?
She's too valuable. She's got to know their whole network. The whole set up. We take her with us.
We're still too far in, they won't risk coming in for us.
You're wastin' your time.
He'll be looking for the trip wires. If we're lucky, he won't see this.
Guess I've picked up some bad habits from you, Dutch. Now don't argue with me, you know I'm right. Get to that chopper and hold it for us. We'll be along.
What's got Billy so spooked?
I'm sorry, Bull. It's never easy. He was a good soldier.
You're looking well, Dutch.
That's over the border, General.
What's he got?
What in God's name...?
How could anyone get through this, carry Blain out, right under our noses without leavin' a trace?
Georgia.
I dunno.  Do thigh high, leather boots go with a cocktail dress?
Your uncle will like this.
We can reach an understanding on this.
It's... it's not like that.
You don't know anything about me.
The real estate possibilities are endless.  Most of the yard we'll just level.  I talked to a couple of developers, under the table, of course, and they said --
Congratulations, sir.
What would it take to buy our stock back?  Name your price.
Yes.  I'm here to tell you that I've reconsidered my position on your acquisition offer.
Stop.  For just a moment.  Mr. Kross, I'd like to ask you a few questions <u>before</u> you sign. You realize that you're a target. If you weren't mine, you'd be someone elses, correct?
I... I would take advantage of it.
You'd be initiating a financial battle you'd ultimately lose, Mr. Harris.
You looking' for some company?
What?  You gonna tell me you're lost?
Why don't you just do it out of the kindness of your heart?
Nice car.  Yours?
Very good.  You're obviously mechanical.
New York.
Want to know something?  I don't quite know.  I hadn't planned this.
Where are they?  Shopping together?
It's a very good year.
Did you sleep well?
The one I'm buying this week will cost around 150 million.
Vivian --
Where'd you learn to do this?
Let's hope so.  You'll get some more clothes tomorrow.  I'll be pushed for time so meet me in the hotel lobby at seven forty-five sharp.  Got it?
You're upset, huh?
Know what we're gonna do in a little while then?  We're gonna call Domino's and have'm deliver a bigass pizza.  We're gonna eat it in bed.  We're gonna veg' out and watch television.
Keep talkin'.  I like hearin'.
What id we run into someone I know?
Edward, these women here, I don't think any of'm like the guys they're with.  They're just into it for the money.
Well, it's true.  Just pay me what you owe me and I'm gone.
Fuck off.
What if someone tries to steal it?
You don't want to go all the way to San Francisco in a limousine, do you?  I don't.
To meet some friends.  Rudolpho, a poet... Benoit, a landlord... Mimi, a flower maker...
I know.  I'm glad.
Vivian, I've thought about this a lot.  This is the best solution.
I didn't think so.
At least stay for a drink.  This party's for you.
What time's diner tonight?
Put the pension funds on hold until I say otherwise.
You broke my nose.
You spent it on drugs, didn't you?
Carlos had some great rock.
I can't handle this tonight. I'm going home.
'Lo.
You think I fit here where they just about chew your food for you?
I kissed him, Kit.  On the mouth.
I know.  I stopped pretending and started liking it with him for real.
I don't care about bucks.  I might love this guy.
Couple a hours.
Don't give me that.  Kit gave it to you yesterday, cash.
You bullshittin' me?
Oooh, I love those.
Niece?
You'll like it fine.
Then you use your <u>soup spoon</u>.
Hi, Barney!
Get out!
Don't even think --  -- don't even think about trying to escape. The chains are far too thick. And don't dream of being rescued either. The only way in is secret. And only the Prince, the Count, and I know how to get in and out.
You don't believe me?
He knows I do not love him.
You're the Dread Pirate Roberts; admit it.
You can die slowly cut into a thousand pieces.
Farm boy. Polish my horse's saddle. I want to see my face shining in it by morning.
But what if something happens to you?
Death cannot stop true love. All it can do is delay it for a while.
We'll never succeed -- we may as well die here.
I got married. I didn't want to. It all happened so fast.
I've hired you to help me start a war. That's a prestigious line of work with a long and glorious tradition.
I only dog paddle.
Finish him, finish him. Your way.
To find the Man in Black, obviously.
The Man in Black?
A book?
It was a very emotional time for Buttercup --
Yes.
She will not be murdered. On the day of the wedding, I want the Thieves' Forest emptied and every inhabitant arrested.
There was a mighty duel -- it ranged all over. They were both masters.
Once we're out of sight, take him back to Florin and throw him in the Pit of Despair.
I could never cause you grief; consider our wedding off.  You returned this Westley to his ship?
Your Princess is really a winning creature. A trifle simple, perhaps, but her appeal is undeniable.
Your guess is as good as mine --
Buttercup is marrying Humperdinck in a little less than half an hour, so all we have to do is get in, break up the wedding, steal the Princess, make our escape after I kill Count Rugen.
Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.
This is noble, sir.  His wife is crippled. His children are on the brink of starvation.
I need him to help avenge my father, murdered these twenty years.
True love. You heard him. You could not ask for a more noble cause than that.
Thank you for everything.
Who are you?!
I must know.
Go in, get after her!
He didn't fall? Inconceivable!!
You're just stalling now.
-- get back, witch --
"True love." He said, "true love," Max. My God --
Yeah, an hour.
You are sick, that's why he's here.
How would you like to go back to teasing hair, big mouth?
Yes.  Dopey show-girls in gooey gowns.  Two-three-kick-turn!  Turn- turn-kick-turn!  It's enough to make you throw up!  At last a chance to do straight drama!  To deal with conflict, with inner truth.  Roger De Bris presents history.  Of course, I think we should add a little music.  That whole third act has got to go. They're losing the war.  It's too depressing.  We'll have to put something in there.  Aaahghhh!  I see it!  A line of beautiful girls, dressed as Storm Troopers, black patent leather boots, all marching together... Two-three-kick-turn!  Turn-turn- kick-turn!
Wait a minute.  This is a very big decision.  It might effect the course of my entire life.  I'll have to think about it.  I'll do it.
Wait!  This is Boomerang.  This is Boomerang.
Enough.  It's better.  Please, Lambchop, it's better.  Stop. You're hurting it again.
Uh ... uh ... ooooooops?
Look at that.  A white Rolls Royce. That's it baby, when you got it, flaunt it.
What did I do?
Oh, no.  No.  No.  I meant no scheme.  I merely posed a little, academic accounting theory.  It's just a thought.
Oh, I fell on my keys.  I've got to get out of here.
Much, thank you.  But I am a little lightheaded.  Maybe I should eat something.  Hysterics have a way of severely depleting one's blood sugar, you know.
Where would you like to eat?
Let me see ... it's such a beautiful day.  Why waste it indoors.  I've got it!  Let's go to Coney Island! We'll lunch at the sea shore.
There it is... in red and white! "Springtime For Hitler," signed, sealed and delivered.  What's the matter with you?
Mrs. Eleanor Biddlecombe.  She also owns 50% of the profits.
Mrs. Alma Wentworth.  She owns 100% of the profits.
What is she gonna do here?
Well, it's... uh... it's nice and long... I mean, it's... uh... uh... where do you keep your wallet?
To failure!
Max, I...
Well, I... Well, it's just that... I'm sorry I called you fat, fat, fat.
Vat about it?
Vit the Fuhrer, of course.  He liked me.  Out of all the household staff at Berchtesgarten, I vas his favorite.  I vas the only one allowed into his chambers at bedtime.
Oh, sure.  I used to take him his hot milk and his opium.  Achhh, those were the days.  Vat good times ve had.  Dinner parties vit lovely ladies and gentlemen, singing und dancing.  You know, not many people knew about it, but the Fuhrer vas a terrific dancer.
Vaaaat???
Vhy do you always call me kraut? Kraut is cabbage!  Do ve call you hot dogs?  Ve call you Yanks not franks!
Do you need us?
Bialystock and Blum.  Bialystock and Blum.  Bialystock and Blum. Got dag pa dig.  Bialystock and Blum.
Finder's keepers.
So, the Count hired you this morning, Rudolfo ... Watch the road ... Watch the road.
Good.  Yes.  Thursday.
Okay.
Six months, I'm out on probation, but it's cool now, baby.
Who can we attack?  They're all too big.
I didn't think the police went searching for people who weren't in trouble.
Now there's a couple even remarking about your sign, and see how easily you forgot them?
It was raining and her hair didn't look like that... damped out, I guess.
Very early. Dawn.
The following morning. Sunday.
No.
No! Of all...
Oh. My private parlor. She had an awful hunger... so I made her some supper. And then she went to bed and left in the morning. I didn't even see her leave.
Cash.
Not at all!
No. I told you, she's confined...
Sick old women are sharp. Come on, I won't disturb...
Why?
I'm in no mood for trouble!
Sick of the sight of it!  Well, suppose you look around for something that strikes your eyes and meanwhile I'll have my mechanic give yours the once over and... want some coffee? I was just about...
You mean you don't want the usual day and a half to think it over?  You are in a hurry! Somebody chasin' you?
Well... heck, this is the first time I ever saw the customer high-pressure the salesman!  I'd figure roughly...  ...your car plus five hundred.
I'll be perfectly honest with you, Ma'am. It's not that I don't trust you, but...
It'll pass. Headaches are like resolutions... you forget them soon as they stop hurting.
Will you help us? I think something's wrong out there!
She left Phoenix a week ago yesterday. And no trace until...
He didn't mention the money.  What he said on the phone isn't important, is it?  He was supposed to come back after he spoke to the mother, and he didn't! That's what I want you to do something about!
I'm Mary's sister.
What should I know?
I was getting to that!
Well why didn't she come to me... call me...?
I came flying up here expecting to get some explanation... for all I know, she may be trying to get in touch with me, at home. I'd better go home.
Sometimes Saturday night has a lonely sound. Ever notice, Lila?
He didn't come back here?
Yes.
I won't feel satisfied unless I got out there, Sam.
Where'd you go to college?
Do you know how I found out about you? I found one of your letters... it was a nice letter, Sam.
Huh?
We have to go into that cabin and search it, Sam... no matter what we're afraid of finding and no matter how much it may hurt.
You can't go up there.
Call your boss and tell him you're taking the rest of the afternoon off. It's Friday anyway... and hot.
I'm sorry, Mary.  My old Dad used to say 'when you can't change a situation, laugh at it.' Nothing ridicules a thing like laughing at it.
For what?
And live with me in a storeroom behind a hardware store in Fairvale. We'll have a lot of laughs. When I send my ex-wife her money, you can lick the stamps.
You know what I'd like? A clear, empty sky... and a plane, and us in it... and somewhere a private island for sale, where we can run around without our... shoes on.  And the wherewithal to buy what I'd like.  Mary, you want to cut this off, go out and find yourself someone available.
Hey, we can leave together can't we?
Dirty night.
I want sleep more than anything. Except maybe, food.
Am I that close to Fairvale?
Stuffy in here.  Well... the mattress is soft and there're hangers in the closet and... stationary with "Bates' Motel" printed on it in case you want to make your friends back home envious... and... the... over there.... 
I'll be in the office if you want anything... just tap on the wall.
You have something most girls never have.
A man should have a hobby.
Is your time so empty?
I'm looking for a private island.
You should... mind it.
Except you.
Why don't you go away?
I've suggested it myself. But I hate to even think such a thing.  She needs me... and it isn't...  ...it isn't as if she were a maniac, a raving thing... it's just that... sometimes she goes a little mad. We all go a little mad sometimes. Haven't you?
Thank you, Norman.
You're not going to... to your room already?
Phoenix?
You slept here all night?
There are plenty of motels in this area. You should have... I mean, just to be safe...
Is anything wrong?
In the course of my duty, I never "take up" anyone's time, whether it's to give a warning, or a ticket, or help! Believe that, M'am.  Now if you woke up on the wrong side of... the car seat, that's one thing. But when you act as if I've just placed you under arrest...
Just coming up to ring for you.
I'll take you to...
I'll get your bags.
I've been doing all the talking so far, haven't I?
Where will you get the money to do that, Bates... or do you already have it... socked away... a lot of it...
Mother, she's just a stranger!  As if men don't desire strangers, as if... oh, I refuse to speak of disgusting things because they disgust me! You understand, Boy?
They thought she'd be coming to me.
Now wait a minute, Sam. You sure you saw an old woman?
No mother.
Just before she died she came to--
He hardly knew of them him- self.  I believe it was his uncle in Australia.
So--friendly or otherwise--?
Yes--I can't stand it-- everybody wants papers-- oh, oh 
I know I am. Why, I even heard a shot up there last night.
Fine. Mrs. Buckley will be all right when she gets used to the idea.
What is it?
You're losing your blood?
Your father?
By the time we return there, all the preparations for the blood transfusion are completed.
What are you laughing at?
I don't see any big-moneyed boys running after you.
I don't have any affairs. What do you mean?
But why? She's the best friend I've got.
She thinks it's funny to talk the way she does, but--
Are we going to have the same quarrel over again?
You wouldn't have said that before you met her.
Are you giving me this straight?
Not a very good one, I guess. He wasn't like anything human. He hobbled and swayed like a monkey, and the face, from the glimpse I got of it in the light from the street, was like an African war mask.
All right, what about it? We get out a paper just the same. Did you ever stop to think of that?
Well, ain't that a shame. Nice little chappie that wouldn't harm a fly ... everybody picking on the little fellow.
I'm glad to hear it. When did you go in for crusading in the cause of justice? This lousy mug, with all the money in the world, has had two or three nasty affairs. He's kept out o' print because his great- grandfather was smarter than the Indians.
You cannot. I'm still editor of this sheet.
Well, why so mysterious! Come on, spill it.
Listen, Jo-jo. Does this mean anything to you? Joan Gale's body swiped from the morgue -- Did you ever hear of such a thing as a death mask?
And it came to life and divorced you. I know all about that. Now my idea is this: Somebody swipes the girl's body, takes impression, makes a mold, produces wax figure ... Bingo! ... Peddles it to this old skate down there!
No kiddin'?
This one's a story, but I'm not going to tell you what it is. Every time I tell you anything it goes haywire.
You didn't happen to be going to Worth's place, did you?
Call the Homicide Squad!
Oh, yeah? Maybe she didn't commit suicide. She may have been murdered!
Why would I string y'? They were sweeties until a month ago.
What are you people doing out in the middle of the night?
Listen, kid. You're in a tough spot, and you can make it a whole lot easier for yourself if you cut out the cry-baby stuff --
Hmmm. Why didn't you tell that to the police?
I see. Was that all she said?
Hold on, hold on. I'm trying to help you, if you're on the square, and I think you are.
Now look here. It's not up to us to do our own detective work. I've had enough trouble over this matter. I don't want anything more to do with it.
--and so determined to live that I'm going to get out and take a taxi if you don't watch where you're going.
It doesn't usually take that long, but I'll forgive you -- you were in a tough spot when I met you.
How much money have you got?
My partner believes that I should build a horror chamber, immortalizing the hideous crimes and criminals of London. At such times Marie Antoinette has reassured me, she has promised me recognition for the devotion I gave to her.
Everything, my friend. And you hope to be a great sculptor --  A great sculptor. Look -- this forearm is at least two inches too long.
Shall we unpack it?
What are you laughing at?
I'm glad they didn't hold you downtown.
Well, any time I can do anything for you --
What was her name?
Could you?
Of what?
No.  I didn't.   I'm listening.
She's in L.A., he's in the Bay area --
Yes?
She must have gone out for a walk with the children.
They're filthy, Mother.
In what sense were they bad?
I didn't hear you. I didn't hear that.
No, I'm awake. What's the matter?
It's so terrible I can't tell you. Oh, Buddy, you don't know how it hurts to have a broken heart, what a terrible feeling it is, and I've had a broken heart so many times. Men, I don't understand them, I can't figure them out and they break my heart, that's all. I can't find Mr. Right, Buddy, I can't find him no matter how hard I look, all I find is a whole pile of Mr. Wrongs. But this is the worst ever because it wasn't his fault. It was my fault, oh yes, my fault, I was bad -- oh God, I was bad, you wouldn't believe how bad I was.
Promise not to tell Doll? -- or nobody? Buddy, it's your Daddy! I'm so much in love with him I am out of my mind!
Well, I thought they were more like a cantaloupe.
Actually, I am, though.
Well, are you satisfied now? Can we just lie and talk, huh?
Buddy, you're just a child.
I must be outta my mind. Buddy, quit it.
No. No, you're not hurting me.  But I think you better quit it.
Rose, are you all right? Are you sick or something?
Buddy, you wouldn't tell nobody, would you?
Rose, they could stick splinters under my fingernails, and I will never say a word! I will never tell them, because... I love you!
Did your Momma really give you castor oil?
Rose, you must know who the fellow is.
You don't know the bedside manner that man has got. Why, it does me good just to see him sit there all solemn and go pokin' in his bag like he's gonna cure me, which he did of course. And even more important he loves me, like a patient I mean, the other day he got tears in his eyes just listenin' to my heart beat.
He's got doubts about hisself and that's the saddest thing of all. Would you believe that poor man thinks nobody likes him?
Makin' homes for purple martins, huh? We had 'em on the farm. They're the prettiest things. That's what I wish I was, a bird. Just fly around catch bugs and have a lot of fun.
Yep, we had 'em in orange crates all over. It was Daddy's dream. He was goin' to get rich raisin' rabbits. It was what killed Daddy. He didn't drown hisself till a long time later after Momma and Lunette died of typhoid, but it was them rabbits what killed him.
Maybe it was eating all those rabbits that made you sexy, Rose.
Of course not!
What do you think, Brother?
Well. Well, what I mean is, you could prove it was his shoes if you did catch him. But look this, Brother, it is even more interesting. Look at this mark here, and that mark over there. Now wouldn't you say those marks are the marks of a ladder?
Open that door, damn you!
All right, all right. Doll and Waski are upstairs taking their nap, you go get them and bring them down to the living room. Where is the girl?
Heh, what a hypocrite.
Excuse me, gotta go to bathroom.
Daddy says Rose is calm as lettuce. Do you believe that, Doll?
No, Mother, he's lying...
Are they polar bears, too?
How could that be, son?
You're damn right it incensed me, the miserable bastard. He also said the kikes and the niggers have taken over Washington. D.C.
That's what she would say herself.
It's funny you would mention Rose, I was thinking about her all the way up in the car.  Or maybe it isn't so funny.
It isn't the fourth dimension. To you it's the fourth dimension, maybe, to me it's simply the truth.
Good morning, sweetheart. Beautiful day.
I wish you wouldn't pick on Rose and tease her like that. Of course her clothes are silly, but she's ignorant, naive, she doesn't know any better.
Well, I admit that outfit isn't very modest. But she doesn't mean any harm, she just wants to attract, attention.
Quarter of twelve.
Why shouldn't she go out and have boyfriends?
Well, I wish you'd stop criticizing and picking on her.
Well, time will tell, won't it?
Boys? You say to me boys?
Now darlin', what has the South got to do with this?
She hasn't actually done anything...
She does look a little peaky.
Honey, Rose was born on a farm and has terrible memories of farm life. Now I don't think --
This is a total catastrastroke. As of this moment I am stumped, I admit, I am stumped and treed both, the hound dogs have me surrounded.
Reluctantly, I do. It would be a blessing to her and everyone else. The girl is oversexed and I say -- spay her!
I thought I knew you. I thought I knew you better, I thought in your heart you were a good and kind man. Well, I can't believe what I've just heard in this room. A defenseless girl depending on you for protection, and you propose to mutilate and destroy her. How could you listen even for a moment to that sadistic man?
Yes, sir.
Rosebird Baby, you are the light of my life, darlin'. How did we ever get by without you?
Why, sure, always got time to get you a half-a-cup, and one of these days I'm gonna get you a whole cup and see what happens.
You were up late last night, too, Rose.
Where do you want me to let you out, Rose?
You don't know where you're going?
All right, thanks to her, and thanks to this case of epizootics, you are getting another chance.  But don't try my patience again. We have growing children in this house. Do you understand me?
Umm. Well. Yes. But no more strange voices in the night, Rose.
I got an awful bad cold.
You're looking very chipper this morning, Rose. Sow do you feel?
Rose... I hate to be mean, but...  Oh, nevermind, forget it.
Well, I am in the construction business, Buddy, and without braggin' I have done real good at it.  There are those who wouldn't have expected that out of me.  Right now I'm buildin' a giant motel unit near Alexandria, outside Washington, D.C. Not fi-nance, I'm on the construction side.
Well, no, I didn't actually.
She used to call me Mr. Right. Remember that, Buddy?
I don't like that, either, it's worse than Waski. I want to be called Fran.
Well, Mrs. Hillyer, the girl is strong as an ox and that is what is keeping her alive. But not many people walk away from double pneumonia, Madam, not many.
Afraid of the hospital?
It's simply that I find it incredible, Mr. Hillyer. Aside from the girl's illness at the moment, she is very strong, a very healthy specimen of a young human female -- and a comely one, too. She must have gotten protein somewhere as a young child, if only sporadically.
Yes, thank you, Doctor.
Oh, good evening, Doctor. Rose is a lot better, I just gave her her supper. She's almost all well now.
Are you human beings or are you some kind of male monsters? Is there no limit to which you won't go to keep your illusions about yourselves?
When he was baby we called him "Wa Wa," a baby name, you know. You will find him a very good boy. His brother can be bad and so can his sister, but Waski is a very good boy. And as you can see he's beautiful.
I'm not goin' in there, I don't like the looks of it!
Well, I... I... I don't know... maybe it was... but no, you can't be sure about a thing like that. It wasn't Billy, I didn't know him.
Oh-h, Mrs. Hillyer, I... I can't think. I... I'm not really sure.
Rose, you don't have to.
What... what makes you think you can order me around?!
What Eve and I wouldn't give to meet up with you on the business end of a daisy chain.
How much?
Take her down to the car, and for Christ's sake be careful this time.  Last suspect he took in, butter-fingers dropped her down the stairs.  What a mess.  Why is it we don't appreciate our arms and legs till we've lost the use of them?
Who cares?
It's six o'clock.  Time's runaing out.  Decide.
What'd I say?
I can work this.
Jiminy Christmas.
The ones you got in that fist-fight with a couple a weeks ago... ?
That's them trying to kill us.
Look, Kittle... pull over and let me out.  I'll be fine... okay?  How 'bout that... ?  Oh, Lord almighty, listen to me... I don't want to die!!  Lemme out of this coffin!!
Dean Martin.
They... they shot me.
How you doing back there?
Smooth move, hot-shot.
Laugh it up.  You'll cry later.
What the... ?!  What was that for?
Where we going?
You live like a pig.
Billy, I love you I really do... but I've got to tell you, every day, in every way, you give new meaning to the word "stupidity."
Maybe.
You mean taking bribes, and skimming busts and letting hoods walk? You mean not being able to sleep at night after shaking down some honest Joe?
Your poison's not gonna make it into the veins of any kids this time.
Why do you bother with that mumbo-jumbo crap?  Some fruitcake's writing it between bong hits, making it up as he goes, and you're actually taking the time to read it.
You're the one with the star-spangled hard-on, not me.
I just think you should show some respect.  I mean, call me old fashioned, but 200 years ago when Ben Franklin and those guys signed the Constitution and Declaration of Independence, they did that so we could all share in the freedom...
You know what I mean.
"Go, go, go!"  "Slow down."  Make up your mind.
Alright, flesh-peddler, let's see empty hands!
If it is, that's pretty high up on the totem pole.  What do you think?
Been waiting long?
Come again... ?
Get his attention.
You're... you're not doing what I think you're doing... ?
This much powder you don't throw in the trunk with a blanket over it. It's got to be smuggled.
Oh, yeah... the explosion.
Do tell.
Yeah?  So, what do you want to ask today that I can't answer?  I'm a busy man.
All craft, prepare to jump to hyperspace on my mark.
I tried to stop him once. I couldn't do it.
To be a Jedi, Luke, you must confront and then go beyond the dark side - the side your father couldn't get past. Impatience is the easiest door - for you, like your father. Only, your father was seduced by what he found on the other side of the door, and you have held firm. You're no longer so reckless now, Luke. You are strong and patient. And now, you must face Darth Vader again!
But you can't let her get involved now, Ben. Vader will destroy her.
Your eyesight will return in time.
The Death Star will be completed on schedule.
As you wish.
What is thy bidding, my Master?
What of the reports of the Rebel fleet massing near Sullust?
I have felt him, my Master.
The same as always.
I think my eyes are getting better. Instead of a big dark blur, I see a big light blur.
Why don't you leave that crate and come with us?
Take the squad ahead.  We'll meet at the shield generator at 0300.
Somehow, I got the feeling that didn't help us very much.
Someone who loves you.
Hey, are you awake?
Now we find out if that code is worth the price we paid.
Shall we try and go around?
Han! Hurry! The fleet will be here any moment.
Lando, grab it!
Guess I owe you some thanks, too, Lando.
Good luck.
Lord Vader, this is an unexpected pleasure. We're honored by your presence.
But he asks the impossible. I need more men.
I'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash.
No, you don't. You've always been strong.
You don't know the power of the dark side. I must obey my master.
You cannot hide forever, Luke.
Yoda, I must know.
Told you, did he?
I see.  So this wasn't simply a chance meeting.  You came here with a purpose.
He might be.  I don't know.
Yes.
Uh huh.
Oh Janet
But it seems so unhealthy here.
Well I want to leave.
Oh Brad.
Oh, I hope so my darling.  But let me switch on the light.
Hello.
"Sweet Transvestite"
On the day I went away.
I thought you liked them.  They liked you.
It's Thanksgiving.
But you never had a chance to prove yourself.
I just dislocated my finger.
Some people think bein' shy is a disease, but it don't bother me.
Here's the guys I was tellin' ya about -- This is Cuff an' Link.
I had it pulled. People callin' all the time.  Who needs it -- Who'd you wanna call?
D'you really wanna call?
It's only temporary.
What's the problem? You don't like me -- Don't like the turtles -- What is it?
...What?
How'd ya like hearin' ya name on TV?
Really -- You don't think they're overly feminine?
I thought it might be cute.
Don't be mad at him -- He just wants to help.
Rocky, do you realize everybody in this country knows your face, and after the fight everybody in the world is going to.
I been watchin' the movies -- studyin' -- He ain't weak nowhere.
Paulie, please --
I can't go out.
Too old, dull fighter.  Bobby Judge is a good boy.
...That man's takin' his job too serious.
You best find me another ranked contender an' I mean in a flash, man!
Apollo, how would you rate this last British challenger, Henry Wilcoxson?
Me an' my wife are goin' home 'cause we miss our children an' can't go no more time without seein' them.
Yo, Rocks, buy us sum wine, man.
Hey, whatta ya doin' here -- we're closed... Yo, we're closed!
Hey, the rink is empty 'cause we're closed -- ya ain't allowed in here so do me a favor an' not stay here.
Ten minutes for ten dollars.
The Champ stings the slower challenger with jabs at will -- Balboa blocks eighty percent of the blows with his face -- Creed doesn't look the best he's ever been but is moving smoothly -- Creed snaps out a triple combination that backs Balboa into a corner -- oh, a solid hook by Creed, a master of fist-men.
Why let Rocky here take a chance on cuttin' or breakin' a hand? -- Take a shower, Dipper.
Yo' yellow, old man.
A hundred an' thirty.
...The juice is climbin' every week.
Tomorrow collect from Del Rio -- He's late three weeks. How'd you do last night?
Ya sure?
Here's fifty bucks -- You an' the girl have a nice time.
I feel bad about walkin'.
Ya gettin 150 grand killer. Ya got any plans for it? Whatta ya think? Ya like to put it on the street, make it work for ya?
Sure, you do what ya want. Stay away from the stock market.
What?
Rocky, would you be interested in fighting Apollo Creed for the Championship?
How come ya wanna hang out with those guys? They teach ya bad things.
Listen, I hope ya don't --
What was I gonna say?
I don't care what nobody says, this bum Creed woulda never made it in the Thirties --
Do you see me talkin'? Huh?
Then stand there an' wait till I'm done -- Creed's good, yeah, he's real fine but I gotta boy, y'know Big Dipper, who's got the stuff it takes to be a champ -- He's mean, quick, an' big -- What more d'ya need? Okay, go to work...  Hey -- Yeah -- Whatta ya want?
How old are ya?
Rice is a bum.
Hey, ever think about retirin'?
Listen, Rock, you're a very lucky guy.
Tie it to both ankles -- Leave two feet slack.
Don't you care what the people will say?
Can't hardly tell. Don't swallow the blood -- Go for his ribs. Don't let 'im breathe.
She's a loser -- She don't enjoy life -- She reads -- Brainy -- Pushin' thirty friggin' years old!  She's gonna die alone if she don't wise up.
An' you're dyin' alone, too.
Inflamed joints -- Walkin' in an' out of a freezer carryin' meat plays hell on the joints.
It don't matter.
I'll do okay.
What's the attraction? I don't see it?
What gaps?
This is your largest payday ever -- How do you feel about it?
Oh, a ladies man, huh?
Yeah, I had to go slummin'.  See, a friend of mine's bein' framed.
My problem is I come here to drink in peace.  So if you don't mind...
Work's been slow for me since the cartoons went to color.  But I still got it, Eddie...  'Boop boop be-doop'.
That's Marvin Acme, the gag king.
Hey, Eddie, looks like you really stepped in it this time.
The papers said the safe door was opened, Eddie.
So what's the scam, Eddie?
I just stopped by to tell you that I checked out the Acme probate.
He's not my client.  I was workin' for R.K. Maroon.
Men?  They look more like weasles to me.
They must've taken it off me.
Well, why not?  I'm feeling magnanimous tonight.  The successful conclusion of this case draws the curtain on my career as a jurist. I'm retiring to take a new role in the private sector.
Right here where we're standing, will be the cornerstone of my idea... the cloverleaf -- an elegant cement structure that intertwines freeways.
Here's one for the books... a Toon wearin' human clothes.
Hello, Mr. Valiant.  I rang the doorbell, but I guess you couldn't hear it.
It was Doom who killed Acme, you know?
I didn't know who I could trust.
Hold on a second.
Valiant, did you see the rabbit?
You don't have to.  The rabbit's wife sings at an underground Toon revue joint called The Ink & Paint Club.  You can catch her in action there.
I got him on loan from Disney.
Well, you better start thinkin' about drinkin' it black.
Hi, Mr. Maroon.  Remember me?
Maroon?  Whaddaya want?
You tricked me, damn you!
What the hell are you doin'?
Valiant and Valiant?  Who's the other Valiant?
I think you oughta read it to her.
But alas poor Romeo! he is already dead; stabbed with a white wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a love-song; the very pin of his heart cleft with the blind bow-boy's butt-shaft: and is he a man to encounter Tybalt?
Why then, O brawling love, O loving hate, O anything of nothing first create. heavy lightness. Serious vanity. Misshapen chaos of well seeming forms.
Out of her favour, where I am in love.
Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
This wind, you talk of, blows us from ourselves; Supper is done, and we shall come too late.
Drink it off and, if you had the strength of twenty men it would dispatch you straight.
Young son, it argues a distemper'd head so soon to bid good marrow to thy bed: or if not so so, then here I hit it right, our Romeo hath not seen his bed tonight.
I thought thy disposition better tempered! Thy Juliet is alive. There art thou happy. The law that threatened death becomes thy friend and turns it to exile. There art thou happy. A Pack of blessings light upon thy back. Wherefore railest thou on thy birth the heaven and earth? Since birth and heaven and earth all three do meet in thee at once.
Marry my child next Thursday Morn. The gallant, young and noble gentleman, Sir Paris, at Saint Peter's Church, shall make thee there a joyful bride.
Goodnight.
I bade her come. God forbid! Juliet! Juliet! Juliet!
[Within] Juliet!
What?
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.
She speaks: O, speak again, bright angel!
O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon, That monthly changes in her circled orb, Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.
What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?
So thrive my soul--
Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day.
Young hearts run free. Never be caught up, caught up like Rosaline and thee. Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.
You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings, And soar with them above a common bound.
Why, may one ask?
Pink for flower.
Why, then is my pump well flowered.
Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch. Ay, a scratch, a scratch. HA HA HA.
Calm, Dishonorable, Vile Submission! Thou art my souls hate! Tybalt! You ratcatcher, will you walk?
Why did you do that?
We kept it...
You go shoot me if you want, Vincent, but you'll be dead before I hit the ground.
So what's the deal?
Then Swede and I split with the package and meet you back at the rendezvous.
I never did trust that blonde fuck...
This...this is incredible. Is the rest of Europe like this?
And what's that supposed to mean, Seamus Reilly?
Good Christ!  Can't you lose these jokers?
Sam.  I'm a weapons guy.
I still am.
I know I don't have to, Sam, it's just that, for once, I want to.  when I was a -  Patriot, it was a given I'd sleep with any man it was deemed necessary for me to sleep with.  You know: any man who needed setting up.  Sometimes so we might blackmail him, sometimes so he could be killed.  Sometimes so I could kill him myself. IRA isn't exactly an enlightened feminist organization, Sam.  To most of the men I with I was always the girl.  "Send the girl to do it."  "Tell The girl to take care of it."  "Have the girl fuck him."  But I look at you and I get this feeling you take me for what I am: no more, no less.
I better be getting that.
I'd stake my reputation.
Where's the case?
That was a mistake, trying to kill you. Mikhi did it without consulting me, I'd have never allowed it.
What do you mean?
Whatever you wish...  This has all been a terrible mistake, Gregor.  I wanted to play straight with you, but Edvard insisted we try and kill you.
If you're lying to me you poor excuse for a human being, I'm gonna blow your brains all over this car.
What am I doing here?  Why, I'm here to see my partners, Gregor, the boys in the Russian Mafia.  See, your bosses had hoped to screw me by hiring you to pull your thieving double cross.  But they only just found out that what's in the briefcase is completely useless without me.  I can't fight them, and they can't kill me -- that means we're gonna have to do business together.
Whoever hired us.
Don't talk to me unless you tell me what I want to hear, understand?!?  You have no choice in this, don't think about winning, think about staying alive.  I want the item, and if you don't give it to me, I'm gonna kill you.
Is it done?
It was a mistake, it shouldn't have happened.
I would imagine that the great satisfaction in all of this will be killing the American.
He's tough, your American friend.
You think you can stitch me up on you own?
So this is what, a test?
You shoot alright.
What are you gonna do, call him up and ask him to give us back our shit?
You should watch what you eat.
Is that right?
Perhaps the police?
What'd you say to him?
That was a nice move you did on our young friend.  Judo?
Help yourself.  Since when do you smoke?
A cigarette?  As in one?  One cigarette a week, who smokes like that?
Exactly.  Why not bring them?
Deirdre?  Smart, yeah, and seriously goddamned dangerous.
You know, what you pulled back there, that was bullshit.
But how did you know I would have the presence of mind to pull my weapon when I did?
The question still remains: what do we do now?
What's going on?
We live in a singular world, my friend.
You're a cop...you're a fucking cop...I should kill you.
Fix it yourself?  Why are we even doing this?  There's no need to run, Christ...  You're a cop.
I'm going with you.
Clearly.
Tell me, Sam: why do you do this?
I'm a field agent -- last of an already extinct breed.  I do dark ops.
You were behind the door?
You would have done that?
They don't have the package.
What the fuck happened?
I'm not here very much.
I know I don't need to say this to you, but I need to say it to you.  This is my job, I have to do it.
No you don't, and you know it.
In a minute.
It's the one thing I've got left to hold onto.  Jean-Pierre is one of your closest friends, is he not?
That's a good question.
And now...
"Your field dressing saved his life." That's three I owe you.
Tell me something first.  The package: what was it?
What's the story?
You slept with her!
You slept with her!
You put everything on the line because you...
I was wondering if you had any movies that were particularly new.
Seamus Reilly, boy's a serious Irish Auteur -- a real firebrand.  Thinks his more moderate filmmaking brethren have turned to making movies for peace-loving pussies, if you see what I'm saying.
Tony and I have to talk some business, first.
I'd like to know what they were doing in my town!  Did you get ID off any of them?
Thanks for the loan, man.  I'll have it in a few days, I promise.
He would have won more but he blew it at the end.  Didn't know what Cash and Carry was.
Oh, you would have done great.
What the hell...
Ten thousand right here.
What are we going to do?
We don't know whose money it is!  They might have robbed a bank, who knows?
It won't work.
We would never have to worry about money -- ever again, Jesus!
It's no accident we stumbled on this money.  It's an answer to a prayer!  Every night and every day I've prayed that God would just -- help me out a little, give me a little push.  Tonight my prayer came true.
We'll torch the bases, how's that?
I've got one condition.
We're going to be patient. If we start flashing money around, buying fancy cars and fancy clothes, people are going to ask questions.
I don't know...
Okay then.  I'll do it.
We're dead.  We're dead, We are dead...  What are we going to do?!
Shit!  We're gonna have to get rid of him.  I'm not letting some gangbanger ruin my life.  We can't risk it.
Well I'm not!  Thinks he's got us by the balls.
We had a deal!  What was I, talking to the wall?
You said that last time!
What are you thinking?  We were only supposed to scare him!
Even if we have the tape, that wouldn't shut him up!
Jesus Christ Earl...what are we doing?...
Maybe we should say somethin'.
I don't know.  They got all kinds of high-tech shit nowadays.
We're not?  How do you figure that?
Oh Jesus...
You're the one who's nuts! There's no one left to touch us, Booth.  We're home free!  We just plant a little of the money on Dwayne, and it's all ours.
I understand your logic, Booth, but I don't think...two thousand's going to raise any eyebrows, do you?
There's going to have to be a change in our arrangement.
Could it have been in the Mercedes?
Nothing's wrong.
OK.
OK.  I love you.
That son of a bitch.
Dammit, I'm so sick of this.
Let's just get out of here, get out of this -- place.  We'll drop out, get a house have some kids, get a satellite dish...
A satellite dish?
Sally there's a whole world out there.  We can have a new home. A real home, not some tin-plated dump.  What are you giving up?
What?
All right, deputies, take care, don't let your meat loaf.
Well nothing audible to us.  Maybe the lab can pick something up.
Well we'd like to help you in any way we can.  We're all in this together, as law enforcement officers.
Well, unfortunately Denning's not here to tell us, but I would say someone got their hands on that tape and switched it.
Don't you have to be here?
Dwayne...  It is imperative that we keep this confidential.	Now we know someone's out there.  Very close. It may even be the son of a bitch that killed my partner.
Hello.
Do you know...34 C?  32 C?
I'm just not very good...with all of this stuff.
A lot of men come in here?
Just goes to show you.
Jesse?
Why?
You walked in here looking like you just ate a shit sandwich.
Hey where's the hot pad?
Where's the hot back -- the therapeutic pad thing?
Well you might as well say it. Mister Small Time...
Whatever...
Dwayne please calm down!
Hey we're all friends, right? Friends don't squeal on friends, that's not what Jesse Segundo is all about.
I didn't know you were coming.
Is that the mail?
Are you hungry?
Don't you want it?
We retrieved a few things from the trunk, including a steamer trunk, or the remnants of a trunk, the brass clips and so forth.
That fire was set.  Deliberately. And probably not by anyone found at the scene.
Is it true, Carter?  Are you in Hong Kong right now?
Two-hundred thousand!
The band has been playing over an hour.
Hear you got your ass kicked in Hong Kong, James.
Could you have your partner wait for us outside?
You bring American money?
Wait a second.  You're Steven Reign? You're big time.  You own all them big hotels.  What are you doing in Hong Kong?
Stevie, how's it going my man?  Somebody get a picture, we can use it for a mug shot.
Lemme ask you something, Steven.  And I want the truth.  Is there any way I can date your daughter?  Just dinner and a movie, maybe go listen to some jazz...
You're right, you're a smart guy.  Most counterfeiters only get ten cents on the dollar.  But this is an even swap.  Pure genius.
You owe me a copy of the Beach Boys Greatest Hits, Volume Two.
Just relax and don't worry about a thing.  I'll hook you up in there.  You got condoms?
Carter, get off that stage!
No, we're here for information, to find out where a man named Ricky Tan is.  We must tread softly and keep our ears open.
No.  You are a civilian.  In China, I am Michael Jackson, and you are Toto.
Hello.
Stop!  I'm sick of your bullshit!
What are you gonna do about it, grasshopper?
It sounds impossible --
You want to figure out why they killed your Daddy, get on the plane.
Maybe.  But not like Asians.  We never panic.
He'll be back soon.
It's a long story.
No.  It's not right.
Snoopy?  I love Snoopy.
Pick it up!
Yes.  We have heaven.
I think we should stop talking.
How was the sex?
Are you serious?
That depends.  How do the Fu-Cang-Long usually kill their victims?
Vegas...
Lee, what the hell are you doing?
Lee!
Why didn't you tell me you had a bomb in your mouth?
I could use a little vacation.
I don't know if the Fu-Cang-Long paid you to get rid of Tan, or whether it was a pure vendetta killing -- but you're off this case.  I don't ever want to see you again, you got that?
What's going on?
The Secret Service almost busted Reign at his casino in Macao, but the place burned down before we could move in.
Lee, there was a bombing at the American Embassy.  Two American translators were killed.
All he wanted was some mu-shu.
... if your father were alive, I would be turning to him now.  I didn't blow up the American Embassy, but I believe some of my people did.  My enemies are trying to frame me.  There is a war going on within the Triads -- and I am going to lose.  My name has been written into the book of death.
Nobody can protect me.  I'll make a deal with you, Lee.  But only iff you'll get me out of Hong Kong.
Didn't I teach you to always arch your back?
Lee!  It's him!
You talk very fast.
You have one of these?
It's the same thing!
When a man steps in dung, it is obvious.  There is no need to rub it in his face.  The smell is the same.
Alright, listen, no bullshit just tell me straight: did you really know the guy you were chasin'?
What?
What?!
No, please, I don't --
No, wait.  I don't have it.  You have it.
I'm sorry, Lee.
Oh no.
How'd what go?
Oh baby, don't worry, I'll call you. You can count on it.
You OK?
Any demands yet?
... the director considers this top priority, considering he is a Chinese National and here under difficult circumstances.  His name is Lee.  And he is to be shown every courtesy. Within reason.
I'm talking about the girl.
What the hell am I supposed to do with him? Take him to the zoo?
Hey, man, you can use her. She's an expert!
Okay, look, we're gonna make a trade. You cross the street, leave her on the sidewalk.  I will leave him on this side.  Then we trade places.  You get him, I get her.  Get the picture, Lois?
Where do we find him?
My daughter.
I would like one of my people to help.
I am so sorry about your men.
And Mr. Lee?  Where is he?
I don't believe you.  My father was explaining to Mr. Griffin.  That is how I found out.
What is he up to now?
You don't understand this guy.
Right.
Really?
Yes, yes, I'm sure I only did you good, Maggie.
He wanted to know how you used to like your eggs.
-- It's for you, Ike.
See?  You want custody of my job? ... Why not just consider my wrist slapped and call me when you feel I've served my time?
Is that what I did to you?  Is that what happened?  Did I just not see you?
Well -- I'm sorry, I'm really sorry, Ellie.
Vindication.  How would you like to get some?  A chance to prove that, though your facts weren't entirely straight, your theory was correct.
Then you've got it.  If you leave tomorrow for the hinterlands, you'll have plenty of time before her next wedding trot.
Yes, well, my theory was that she may be running because she gets attention... Negative attention is attention. Like when women whack you on the street because of your column, that's negative attention.
No, I'm paying for the dress.  Do you think she's still gonna run?
You could have told me you were fiance number three.
Guess you'd know about that.  You're an entomologist, right?  How's business?
Sorry, no.  I just got one.
It's okay.  There's no microphone. You're no fun.
I am just such a reporter.  And you are?
Your two cinnamon rolls.
Gee, I hope they don't have a fight out there.  You don't think they'll call it off...?
Dad's fishing trip, Grandma's knee operation, Grandma's birthday...
That's fair.
It's a birthday present for my cousin. Put your finger in.
Maybe someday.
It was one of the most wonderful moments of my life.  Cal Ripken even applauded.
No.  I think I said something eloquent like, "So, uh -- maybe we should, ya know.  What do you think?"
No.
Tell me.  When you get to the altar, will you spike the bouquet?
Ike... Hi, Grandma.
Your filter's clogged.  This takes unleaded.
Where did you disappear to?
That was very interesting research George was doing!
I love you.  I love you.
Yes, you!
I'm okay with that.
You're a goddess!
Good morning to you, too.  You look good.
But you haven't lost your mystery! You're very mysterious!
Something that brings warmth to my heart.  Duckbill platypus.
Lighten up, wahine.
He's not coming.  Watch.  He's not coming.
You and your lucky geese.  You always see geese.
What are you talking about?
Thank you.  You still think that he was....
I'm really rooting for this one.
Maggie, it's just a joke...
A harmless joke.
No, no.  You're her best friend.
I hate boats.
Boats.  You go out in them. You come back in them.  I hate them.
Boats.  All anyone talks about is the wind.  Is it up, is it down.  I can't live with a man who only talks about the wind.
And your brother Tom is a psychology professor and is married to...Betsy --
Is that all right with you?
You sure you don't want to drive with me?
I'll wait.
We'll stay at the Plaza --
Who is it?
I do.
It's not true, but it feels true.
You are.  You're losing your mind.  What about Walter?
Right.
Can too.
Yes.
I thought I would look into doing a story about those radio shows.
Okay.  Good.  Goodbye.
Becky?
So he can't write.  Big deal. I mean, verbal ability is a highly overrated thing in a guy, and our pathetic need for it is what gets us into so much trouble.
What are your plans in New York?
She has a pattern of getting involved with losers... Once she almost ran away with a human cannonball from the circus.
No, I know that part --
He wasn't even wrong for you, like <u>cosmically</u> wrong, so don't beat up on yourself for wasting...however long it was.
Maybe you should see a shrink.
Go home for the weekend.
Perfect.  Sandbag the father.
This is a complete disaster.  I wanted him to find a wife, but he's got the wrong one --
Howard.
Are his folks nice?
It's silly, really.  I mean, I'd seen him at the office, obviously I'd seen him, he's the associate publisher, and then one day we both ordered sandwiches from the same place, and he got my lettuce and tomato sandwich on whole wheat, which of course he was allergic to, and I got his lettuce and tomato on white.
It is, isn't it? You make millions of decisions that mean nothing and then one day you decide to order takeout and it changes your life.
You know.
It's you.
Which means --
Grace the dispatcher.  Great.
Sam, if you're not doing anything New Year's -- obviously you're not doing anything New Year's -- we're having some people over, all of them married, not one even remotely interested in playing around.  Does that sound great or what?  I can't think of the last time I was at a party when anything actually happened.
I'm probably not interested in whatever you're selling.
I'm not mad at you.  Okay, I'm not mad at you.
We've been talking to -- well, let's just call him Sleepless in Seattle, and we'll be right back after this break with listener response, <u>your</u> response, to the things we've been discussing.  The number to call is...
Got me there.  What's your Christmas wish, Jonah?
You don't like the one he was now?
No.
It's very hard for him to talk about this stuff.  It's like it makes him sadder.
Is he home right now?
Hey, my plate is full.
Well.  Things are different. First, you have to be friends. You have to like each other. Then you neck.  This can go on for years.  Then you have tests.  Then you get to do it with a condom.  The good news is, split the check.
You'll find out.
You'll see.
Do you want a fruit plate?
Dad, I don't know about this one --
Sure.  Looking good.
Just out of curiosity, how did they get our address?
This is no good.  She's looking for someone French.  Or Greek.  "Dear Sleepless in Seattle: I live in Tulsa." Where is that? --
I figure we could go to New York, catch the Knicks, and since we'd be there anyway, obviously we'd go to the Empire State Building --
Why is she bringing that bag?
Jonah!
Did you call that radio station again?
God, she's beautiful.
What if I couldn't get to you?
You look good.
I thought you were never going to call me.
The men would like to know who this gentleman is.
Mornin'.
Not so sure about that. Letter of the Law, you know. All the injunction says is no picketing by miners.
Well?
You haven't tried locking them up!
Three hours! Just to heat enough water to wash this stuff!  I tell you something. If this strike is ever settled -- which I doubt -- I don't go back to work unless the company installs hot running water for us.  It should've been a union demand from the beginning.
Who? A scab?
We're only one payment behind. I argued with her. It isn't right.
But you had to have it, didn't you? It was so nice to listen
Was it expensive, the beer?
Did you have to sign a pledge? Not to go back to the line?
A meeting?
Tell me.
It's a lot to them. They'd do anything to open that mine.
Yes. I talk of dignity. The Anglo bosses look down on you, and you hate them for it. "Stay in your place, you dirty Mexican" -- that's what they tell you. But why must you say to me, "Stay in your place." Do you feel better having someone lower than you?
Whose neck shall I stand on, to make me feel superior? And what will I get out of it? I don't want anything lower than I am. I'm low enough already. I want to rise. And push everything up with me as I go ...
Don't horse me. Price of zinc's never been higher. They don't want no strike -- not with their war boom on.
Forgot what?
Where's your mama?
Boy! Did you see the way Mama whopped that deputy with her shoe? Knocked the gun right out ...
Ram?n ... listen for the love of God ...
Are you Australian?
You got a bathroom I can use before we hit the road?
Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy. Rhymes with Simmy.
All I saw was the headlights. The high beams were on.
They were wearing ski masks. I told you all of this.
Who wouldn't?
Because I don't know him and I don't really know you, partner.
Oh, he's a keeper all right.
That's long enough to get out of town.
: What are you up to?
It gets me through the day.
You've got a comeback for everything, don't you, Danny? You use 'em like some sort of shield.
There you go again. You're nothing but false notes.
I'm kind of busy.
I need my paycheck.
Really, I don't want to.
What is it?
Will you do that?  Then I want you to get out of the room.
Colette, go.
Is that what you want me to do?  Put it all on Jesus?  Let him sort it out in the afterlife?
Nice day
Fuuuuuck
Hey, why do you need a gun and a vest anyway?
You want a hit?
Why?
You don't trust me?
Wait  If you don't trust me, why did you tell me that stuff about not using drugs?
You don't understand.
Can we talk price?
You're serious?
Pooh-Bear. come on, man.  What is this?  It's me, Danny. I thought we had a deal.
I ought to just call this whole thing off right now.
What the hell is this?
Cool it. We got business.
You got a name?
No last name?
Yeah. Pretty sure.  Oh yeah ... he had a spear gun, too.
You think I'm a Judas?
Thanks for not judging me.
Tell that to Bobby ... and his wife and kid.
I was getting to it.
What the hell are you doing here?
Guy scores dope and dollar from ripping off other drug dealers.  As least that's what the word is.
Took a pig-slicker to the heart.
This the guy?
Dude is bugging.  Transparent spiders, plastic men - the whole nine yards.
Turns out he's connected.
We know what's going on.
Jimmy?
What'd you do, piss your pants?
When is the deal going down?
And he has a really hot ass with hardly any hair on it.
We're in business.
Where's Bubba?
Danny, listen up.  Here's the deal ... my wife's pimp knows a guy who works at Cedars Sinai medical lab.  They're getting a very special delivery a week from this Friday.
I just want to be straight on the details.  Can I taste it?
Pinned down, a mile east of here, waiting for some help from the navy guns.
Good luck, John.
So, where are you from?
Y'all come back.
Well, I'll be goddamned, I knew it.
No kiddin'?
Watching.
Sir, I understand what you're doin', but I respectfully request permission to grieve in my own manner.
I'm in my backyard, lying in my hammock, with my arm around my wife, listening for the sound of breaking glass.
A paratrooper named Ryan.  He's going home, if he's alive.
I've been humming it.
Good luck, Captain.
The men said, nine.
That only leaves three.
I wonder where they're going.
What about our grenades?
Upham, you've got to learn the difference between whining and griping.  You can't just rely on natural ability, you've got to study and practice.
Worked, didn't it?
Now we've got a straight shot, due north, to Ramelle, twenty-six miles, two villages between here and there, St. Mere, then Bernay.  We'll take the jeep as far as we can, then go on on foot.
A fucking mess, two maybe three Kraut divisions, no fronts, no lines, the drops were completely fouled up, we've got little pockets of paratroopers all over the place, trying to hang on.  Command says we hold St. Mere, but north of that, it's all Krauts.  Even if Ryan's where he's supposed to be, he's more than likely dead.
He's right, Captain, it might be kind of dangerous for those flyboys.
Pulls Wade's hands from the wound. Pours sulfa powder.
What was the name of that kid at Anzio, the one who got his face burned off?
Oh, yeah?
Except this time, the mission IS a man.
John, I've got to tell you, I think you're about used up.
What do you think?
What are we going to do?
So, you ever heard of employee discounts?  My uncle sells shoes, gets twenty-five percent off everything in the line, got a closet filled with the best looking shoes you ever seen.
Well, maybe not the Captain, but the rest of us have mothers.
I've given this a lot of thought, sir.  The best thing that could happen is, we find Ryan and he's dead.
Well, sir, consider the possibilities. A:  Ryan is alive.  We have to take him back to the beach.  Knowing you, you don't let him carry my gear, even though he really should, and we all get killed, trying to keep him alive.
Maybe.  But what if he dies on the way back?  you see what I'm saying, sir?  The best possible situation is, he's dead, we find his body, more or less intact, we grab one of his dog-tags and high-tail it back to the beach, or better yet, we head over to Caen and catch up with division.
Goddamn it!
FIRES THE EIGHTY-EIGHT.
So what?  I've got three satchel charges, six gammon grenades, a dozen- and-a-half pineapples, and all my regular gear.  You don't hear me complaining.
Shit, sir.
Damn fool.  Sir.
But everybody's heard of him, he won the Congressional Medal of Honor, he saved a dozen men.
Demolition, right?
How fast?
Jesus.  What, I live in a palace, right?  I have guests here.
Just come down to my place of business, for god's sake.  I have people here.
The, uh, Cynthia Branson estate was worth how much?  Because her family...
It's no problem.  I called Mom and Dad in Germany; it's like they were there.
Why can't you be his uncle and not his playmate?
You're tough, J-man.
No, no, don't go in there.
Yes.
Did you sleep with her?
So, what's your point?
I draw the line at seven un-returned phone calls.
Trapped in the body of a gameshow hostess.
Lloyd is doomed.
Wait a minute.
"Dear Diane, I'll always be there for you, all the love in my heart, Lloyd."  I've never gotten a letter like this, have you?
What are you doing?
Are you kidding?  You're not kidding?  You're not kidding!
Which they did.  Let me finish.
You've always called before, always.  Now I'm not asking what you did, I just want to know that you're alright.
Dad, you and I have talked about this.  Lloyd and I have talked about this.  Believe me, this is well-covered territory.
Sweetheart, no.  Don't be ridiculous.
Honey!
I swear to god.
Honey, about what?
That's right, work it out.
Take it easy how mad you make me, I'm the only dad you've got.
You will?
No noise, no sound, no movement, nothing!  Hello, Diane?
Whoah, what a day, huh?
Quick question - do you know who I am?
Okay, um, so it's Lloyd and... uh... uh... let's go out.  Do you wanna go out?
Well...
I'll go.
Alright.  This is really great.  Alright, we're going out. It's a date.  It's a scam.  Whatever, whatever, alright, I'll pick you up at what, eight O' clock?
Whoa.
So it's an honor?
So what's your job this summer?
No, I'm serious.
Yeah, just keep going first, keep going around.  Get the feel of it, feel the clutch, when you put it in a little?
You know how it'll come out and feel... y'know... little more, little more... Yeah, yeah, that's right.  Go round just at first, keep it in first, just feel it.
Now, go into second.  Little more gas... Yeah!  You can get  this whole problem.  Now, maybe you downshift to first?
I don't think so.
Why didn't you tell me?
Yeah.
You told your dad?
What, I'm sorry I said that.  Forget I said it, it's what I thought I meant, but forget it.
Hurt me again?  Not a chance, don't worry about it.
PAIN!
Jim Court?
The truck?
Why don't I just get your phone number, that's usually how it works.
Hi, Lloyd.  This is my eighth and final call...
Am I going?  Am I going to England?  I've thought about this quite a bit, and I've realised what I probably should do is just carve out a goal for my future and find out what I wanna do with my life, do all the stuff that I've been avoiding in a big way. I mean, Diane and I can wait for each other, right?  What's she gonna... she's gonna run off with some English guy?  There's no way.
I know.  But then I reconsidered.  'Cause I figured out what I really wanna do with my life, what I want to do for a living is I wanna be with your daughter.  I'm good at it.
I'm the distraction that's going to England with her sir.  Are you alright sir?  Are you okay?
"You can't know the horrible disappointment I feel..."
Joe.  Joe.  She's written sixty-five songs.  They're all about you.  They're all about pain.
Stop freaking with her head man.  Just stop playing with her mind, you know?  She's a human being.  She's a person.  She's very talented, you know.
Diane Court.
Lloyd.  Lloyd Dobler, I've got you.
Lloyd.
Yeah, but how come it worked?  I mean like, what are you?
We finally graduated, big dude guy!
I love you man.
The gentleman thinks a mistake's been made.
What?
He looks great, though, doesn't he? I have to know - where do you get a suit like that?  what is that, silk?  It's great.
I go to work the other day, there's nobody there.  Nobody tells me about this, I have to find out, I have to go in, everybody's gone -
That you know the meaning of the word gratitude.  That it's not some vague thing with you like with some guys.
It's true.  Never happen in Cracow, though, we all love you too much.
You want these people.
You're not telling me something.
Where are the guards?
This is not my problem.
Like this?
How many?
I mean where have you been? Nobody's seen you around for a while.
That'd be fine.
The place produces nothing.  I shouldn't say that - nothing it produces reaches the Army.  That's not all right.
I was just the accountant.
What?
Don't ever do that to me again.
This, I don't know, maybe you can trade it for something.
I got to go, I'll see you.
You think I don't know what you're doing? You're so quiet all the time?  I know.
I'll admit it's a weakness.  I don't think he enjoys it.  All right, he does enjoy it, so what? What do you expect me to do about it?
I'll talk to you later.
I didn't do enough.
A one-armed machinist, Oskar?
I would say we are now officially baffled.
Don't do that. Hang up...call...
"Drink with your brain." That's our motto. Who are you calling for?
What do you want from me, Cotton?
I did that.
You know the story, Gale. Man falsely accused, sent to prison, proved innocent, released back into the real world and never trusted again. Want the exclusive?
And are the police sure about that?
I couldn't believe you didn't recognize me. You even interviewed me for your book.
But you'll never get away with it.
How do you put up with this Greek shit?
What about your film? Isn't it due next week? Have you even started it?
I had the four o'clock shift. You weren't there. You had us worried. Is everything okay?
I don't really know what happened in Woodsboro, Sid. But I know you don't trust me.
Why?
Where's Sid?
Ever see NATURAL BORN KILLERS? Well, Derek and I have this whole Mickey/Mallory-Woody Harrelson/Juliette Lewis thing going on.
He sent me the cutest e-mail.
We have a surprise guest star waiting in the wings.
Oh yeah.  We figure the one of us that actually kills you will get a little more press. It's been an ongoing discussion.  Heads or tails?
We had to have financing.
Yes, Miss Weathers, your name is embedded clearly between my ears.
You broke my heart.
And it's sexier in the dark.
The sorority girl was gutted with autopsy precision.
Three hundred people watched? Nobody did anything?
Oh my God. How could it happen?
You go, it's all stairs, I can take it from here.
Hey, I got stuff to do. But I'll find you later, okay.
I don't play games.
Oh--a God complex
You're getting obvious.
It's good to see you involved.
What?
"If I should stay. I would only be in your way. So I'll go. And yet, I know, I'll think of you each step of the way...
You're going to get it. You know what happens.
Knock yourself out.
No, girletta, I don't leave your side.
Can I come with her?
The Ghost advances on the young girl, grabbing her, pulling her to him, raising high a long, hunting knife. The young girl is helpless...
Randy Meeks.  He was with Sid that night in Woodsboro.
Sid, I'll seeya tonight.
Take it off.
Why doesn't she just hang up and call the police? Stupid..
Sid? Jesus, where's Hallie? I've been here all night.
I'll be right back.
What do you want?
There's always someone out there stalking actors. Look at that woman from the Commish.
I did. Hon, although I got a total of six minutes screen time, they're the best six minutes of the movie.
Who is this?
I've tried to get in touch with Sidney Prescott, but she's keeping herself very well hidden. You're my one and only hope in finding her. Her life may be in grave danger.
Alright Kincaid, no where to?
Four? There are five.
Jesus Gale what happened?
The killer leaves a newspaper clipping at each murder, Sidney. Recently he's also left a photo of your mother.
What do you know about trilogies?
That's fine Mr. Rielly, but if anyone else should die, I'm going to have to get a warrant.
Sidney, do you have any idea how he could've gotten your number?
Listen Dewey I have to go to the bathroom.
You mean OUR past as in Me and Sid. This has nothing to do with you Gale.
Do you really mean it this time Gale?
What's wrong with just being Gale Weathers? I liked her!
I already removed it.  I think someone on the film was trying to find Sid, and that's the only reason I came here. To make do a little private investigating of my own and make sure no one here was planning anything.
You're not a detective.
Don't worry. I'm prepared for anything.
Sidney, what happened?
What the hell are you guys getting at?  I make horror films, that's what I do.  The Studio came to me with 'Stab'.  They came to me, check it out.
You! How can I ever get any fame playing you!
Shit! Where the hell are Tom and Angelina?
Who's phone?
No really?
Nobody said she was an actor.
I think Milton's the killer. I think he just went out to kill another cast member.
Excuse me Detective, I think we have some business to attend to.
Just because you knew her?
I don't think so!  Just what happened to Maureen when she was in Hollywood?
Well how would you like his rotten carcass dug up and drug all over National TV? Why don't you start talking.
Hey I really liked that piece you did on me last month. The one where you said my car accident was caused by me drinking and drugs, and how I faked the tire blow-out just so my insurance wouldn't sky rocket.
What'd he say?
We did some researching in the archives. Sid, something dawned on me when I wrote the book on your mother's murder. For two years of her life, 1969 up until 1971 she basically disappeared off the face of the Earth.
Hello.
It's Sarah.
It is in my script.
Goddamnit I am getting so fed up with these re-writes. It's like every five minutes there's a new script. God, and you just know this all because of STAB 2's script winding up on the internet two months after it wrapped shooting.
What are you talking about? The murders were a completely isolated incident.
No.
Where?
Alright, I'm here. Now what?
Laura I think I just killed somebody.
I didn't kill anybody.
Because I'm trying to build your self-esteem. You're far too sensitive.
You ready to party hard tonight?
Ready?
She can't get both of us.
I don't know Billy but I'm hurtin'.
Billy? What the...
Close call.
Yeah, it was edited for TV. All the good stuff was cut out and I started thinking about us and how two years ago, we started off kinda hot and heavy, a nice solid "R" rating on our way to an NC17. And how things have changed and, lately, we're just sot of... edited for television.
You know what my dad will do to you?
Would you settle for a PG-13 relationship?
No... I don't... it's just... Oh God, Billy, someone was there, someone tried to kill me.
No...
No, Billy. I'm the one who's been selfish and self-absorbed with all of my post traumatic stress.
Sshh... it's okay.
Yes.
What number are you trying to reach?
Hello.
I don't think so.
Popcorn.
I'm getting ready to watch a video.
The first one was, but the rest sucked.
I have to go now.
Nah, I don't think so...
Is this some kind of a joke?
So you better leave.
I wanna play a game.
Don't do this. I can't...
No...
Afraid not.
Hi! Gale Weathers. Field Correspondent, INSIDE STORY.
I just turned 25. I was 24 for a whole year.
Ma'am, I am the Deputy of this town.
I like it. It's... sexy.
People treat me like the Antichrist of television journalism.
Shit. It's Neil Prescott's car.
Billy was released. His cellular bill was clean. He didn't make those calls.
God, look at this place, it's THE TOWN THAT DREADED SUNDOWN.
I was first to respond.
That ghost mask is sold at both Kroger's and WalMart. Neither of which keep purchase records.
Dewey! Where the hell you been, boy?
Listen up, Dewey, because it's bad. Real bad. Aircomp just faxed us. The calls were listed to Neil Prescott -- Sidney's father. He made the calls with his cellular phone. It's confirmed.
That fish smelled strong.
Casey! Casey!
What? What?
No, not so fast. We have nothing concrete.
How's the book?
I'll look for it.
I want to talk to you.
Please. You owe me.
Many times.
Looks like you fingered the wrong guy... again.
...so call if you need me.
Have a good trip.
THE FOG, TERROR TRAIN, PROM NIGHT -- How come Jamie Lee Curtis is in all these movies?
You coming tonight?
Why would he want to kill his own girlfriend?
So what's his reason?
She's saving herself for you.
Which is you...
There goes my chance with Sid.
There are certain rules that one must abide by in order to successfully survive a horror movie. For instance: 1. You can never have sex. The minute you get a little nookie -- you're as good as gone. Sex always equals death. 2. Never drink or do drugs. The sin factor. It's an extension of number one. And 3. Never, ever, ever, under any circumstances, say "I'll be right back."
Why are they doing this?
And to celebrate this impromptu fall break, I propose we have a party. Tonight, my house.
Remember, there's safety in numbers.
If Tatum sees you -- she'll draw blood.
Fucking clueless -- they're interrogating the entire school. Teachers, students, staff, janitors...
Uh-huh, it's just... you know, the police and reporters... it brings it all back.
It's okay. She was supposed to pick me up.
This is a mistake. I shouldn't be here.
I didn't say that, Sid. But you know there were rumors. Your dad was always out of town on business. Maybe your mom was a very unhappy woman.
It goes further back, Sid. There's been talk about other men.
If I was wrong Cotton, then he's still out there.
You're right. I'm cracking up. Ignore me.
TATUM!
There's that sense of humor. I knew it still existed. Ohh, Sid, let's have some fun tonight.
That's not necessary.  You're in.
He cuts off the skin if his fingertips. That's why we can't find a single usable print in the apartment.  He's been doing it for quite a while.  Keeps cutting before the papillary line can grow back.
He's pissing in our faces again and we're just taking it.
What do you think?
There are seven deadly sins.  Gluttony, wrath, greed...
You've left unfinished business before.
Come on.  What are you going to do with yourself out there?
Can't you feel it yet?  Can't you feel that feeling... ?  You're not going to be a cop anymore.
Well, there he sits.  It's not supposed to make sense.
Thank you.  Tell them, thank you.
What the hell's going on?
I don't believe it.
What time is it?
I hate to burst your bubble, but other than the fact that you're especially sadistic, there's nothing unusual about these precious murders of yours.
Innocent?  Is that supposed to be funny? Look at the people I killed.  An obese man, a disgusting man who could barely stand up... who if you saw him on the street, you'd point so your friends could mock him along with you.  Who if you saw him while you were eating, you wouldn't be able to finish  your meal.  After him I picked the lawyer.  And, you both must have been secretly thanking me for that one.  This was a man who dedicated his life to making money by lying with every breath he could muster... to keeping rapists and murderers on the streets.
Just keep leading the way.
You've made a good life for yourself...
You think it was poison?
Same color and texture.
The leather chair was soaked through with sweat.
Attrition.  When you regret your sins, but not because you love God.
I wish I still thought like you.
We put it in a nice neat pile and file it away, on the slim chance it's ever needed in a courtroom.  It's like collecting diamonds on a desert island.  You keep them just in case you ever get rescued, but it's a pretty big ocean out there.
The way this has gone till now, I wouldn't have thought it was possible, but we may have underestimated this guy.
Victor's landlord says an envelope of cash was in the office mailbox each month.  He says, quote, "I never heard a single complaint from the tenant in apartment three-o-one, and nobody ever complained about him.  He's the best tenant I've ever had.
Oh, blah, blah, blah.  The guy's insane.
Hey, Freud, what brand of bullshit are you shoveling, huh?  Right now he's probably dancing around his room in a pair of his mommy's panties, singing show tunes and rubbing himself with peanut butter...
It's probably nothing, but even if it is, it's no skin off our teeth.  The man at Hot Dog World is a friend, in the Bureau.
For a long time, the F.B.I.'s been hooked into the library system, keeping accurate records.
The Writings of Saint Thomas Aqu... Aquin...
Wait... just wait.
Think about it...
We could use about fifty more men here.
Don't try to focus on things as black and white, because you'll go blind.  There's no winning and losing here.
You're talking about people who are mentally ill.  You're...
As soon as this is over, I'm gone.
You know he's fucking us.
What is it?
Stay with him.
Throw your gun down now!
I'm sorry about this, Mrs. Gould.  I really am.
It smells good.
I don't know why I asked you to come.
Well, I got up one morning and went to work... just like any other day, except it was my first since hearing about the baby. And, I... I felt this fear and anxiety washing over me.  I looked around, and I thought, how can we raise a child surrounded by all this?  How can a child grow up here?  So, that night, I told her I didn't want us to have it, and over the next few weeks, I convinced her it was wrong.  I mean... I wore her down, slowly.
Passed the Todd place comin' in... What happened to 'em?
It's all right, ma...I been watchin'... Only I wish...
It's all right...Charlie, let's move outside.
Another one, eh?
They're camped by the river -- 'bout twenty miles from here. Soon's it gets dark we'll circle out so's to jump 'em before day- break.
What do you know about it?...What's a quarter-breed Cherokee know about the Comanche trick of sleeping with his best pony tied right beside him...You got as much chance of stampedin' their herd as...
Now son, it's a bitter thing to say, but there's more than your sister at stake here.
Never mind...Your pa know you're out here?
You help me find her, you got your rockin' chair...
What you want me to call you?
Well, come on!
Nothing for you to see.
Easy on that!
Jorgensen's been runnin' his cattle with my own...
Martin...I want you to know some- thin'...
Hey! What's the idea...?
Let's go...I think I stumbled onto somethin'...
What I heard back there was that a band o' hostile Nawyeckas came through this way less'n two weeks ago...
Beats me how she could get that pony out o' camp without neither of us hearin' a thing...
I'd be obliged if you'd get to the point, ma'am.
She's not a little girl any more.
I...I wrote you a letter...Reckon you didn't get it...
Fetch <U>what</U> home?...The leavin's of Comanche bucks -- sold time an' again to the highest bidder?...With savage brats of her own, most like?...
But couldn't you...?
Why else?
So, how does it feel to be kissed by two women?
Oh, the muse... we're still having our differences.  You know how it is with women.
Hey... the fuse.
Do you know where fuse box is?
Hey, flower child, the sixties are over.  And this stuff is hazardous to your health.
Where are you going?
Maybe I should talk to Dr. Roth about it.
I have a funny feeling.  Do you think we'll get over all that's happened?
Who was that?
Well, apparently it was a big mistake to try talking to you. Don't you remember what we promised to each other?  Honesty - trust!
Who's that?
She was old.
You know, Tommi wants me to become the man I used to be.
I really hate to bother him, but...
What?
You didn't tell her!
You did not like the speech?
Ned?I know?I know
Oh
Ah
I know your face. Are you an actor?
What do you want, Kit?
What is money to me like us? Besides, if I need a play, I have another waiting, a comedy by Shakespeare.
Never!
There is no dog in the first scene, Will Kempe, thank you. How goes it Will?
Are you writing?
Black Sue, Fat Phoebe, Rosaline, Burbage's seamstress; Aphrodite, who does it behind the Dog and
And your relations?
Will it restore my gift?
When?
A new comedy. By Will Shakespeare!
This time we take your boots off!
How?
Where is the play?
No Juliet?!
Who is she this time?!
Burbage offers me a partnership in the Chamberlain's Men. For fifty pounds my hired player days are over.
Where are you going?
Will! Have you finished?
How will it?
The show must ? you know
Romeo is?Italian. Always in and out of love.
"Good morrow, cousin."
But at the playhouse. Nurse?
He looks well enough for a mountebank.
What do you love so much?
And--?
But playwrights teach nothing about love, they make it pretty, they make it comical, or they make it lust. They cannot make it true.
"?All my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay, And follow thee my lord throughout the world."
Will!
It is not my fault, Master Shakespeare. I could do it yesterday.
I would not for the world!
What does Burbage care of that? He is readying the Curtain for Kit Marlowe.
Wait! You are still a maid and perhaps as mistook in me as I was mistook in Thomas Kent.
I am.
"Good night, good night. As sweet repose and rest Come to thy heart as that within my breast. O wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?"
He was not dead before. I would exchange all my plays to come for all of his that will never come.
Will you read it for me?
"?thou need'st not to be gone."
A hired player no longer. Fifty pounds, Will, for the poet of true love.
At sea, then--a voyage to a new world??she lands upon a vast and empty shore. She is brought to the duke?Orsino.
You will never age for me, nor fade, nor die.
My lady VIOLA.
How your mind hops about! Your father was a shopkeeper, your children will bear arms, and I will recover my fortune. That is the only matter under discussion today. You will like Virginia.
Will you defy your father and your Queen?
I mean?Your Majesty, they do not, they have not, but I believe there is one who can
Take off your hat.
Wait there.
Yes, sir.
Oh!--it's--it's--oh, it's a house of ill- repute!
All right, just a few questions.
I was trying to educate you.
I don't want to devalue your victory, but I just want you to know: I wasn't trying to win.
About this guy, this Hugo person.
Only on expenses.
It's asick idea, Alex. It's sick.
You think so?
So who's going to do it?
You know what. Who's going to do it.
I can't do it.
I won't be able to.
Finished.
That was good.
Yeah, but you were good, you were really good. Fucking bin-bag', I liked that. You were good. You explored your maleness to the full there.
How much did you pay?
What's all this for, more security?
Who?
No, really, I am sorry, sorry to be ducking out on you like this. I hope you won't take it personally.
I mean, we've had ups and downs, right -- good times, bad times?
It's very kind of you to offer, but --
Animals involved? I know, but you need a change. And besides, we're short.
Don't know what?
Is this being recorded?
No. Why should it?
That's it, then.
Well, Cameron, are you comfortable?
Yes. It is, isn't it? We alllike it. And the room's nice too, don't you think?
Yes.
When you slaughter a goat and wrench its heart out with your bare hands, do you then summon hellfire?
So we'll meet him, then?
Aroused and inflamed.
-- instead of what he is --
The man we know and love.
I think you're lying.
Maybe he didn't like us.
Now?
What are you doing?
Thats not a story, Alex. It's a corpse.
No, Alex. It's, it's --
Sshh.
David, I promise we will. Keep him happy.
Cameron. You remember Cameron.
What's he doing here?
Hello. Hello.
No.
Will you calm down.
You know, you should spend some of that money instead of worrying about it. That's my advice.
I don't see the point in that.
Leave him alone.
Later. But first -- him.
Exactly. Now I've been thinking --
No, definitely not. And that's that. I refuse to discuss it further.
And if it sounds like I'm being killed, you'll phone the police, you'll tell them everything?
Everything. Except maybe that it was his idea and not mine in the first place. OK? That's important to me. I need to die misunderstood.
I don't know. I thought maybe I was --
Don't you ever stop?
Stop him, Alex. You've got to stop him.
So, uh...
It's OK. There's no problem.
Good evening. I'm Detective Inspector McCall and this is DC Mitchell. I wonder if we could ask you some questions.
No, they were asleep. They didn't even wake up.
It's just that you strike me as a man trapped in a crisis of emotional direction, afflicted by a realization that the partner of your dreams is, quite simply, just that.
Would you like to talk about it?
Two hundred pounds.
In this firm.
There's a whole wide world out there, and it all needs to be accounted for, doesn't it?
But they sneer, don't they?
What guy that died?
Here?.
Do you think you could answer that?
Yes, the telephone, but if it's for me, I'm not in. HUGO You're not in.
For what?
It's up to you. Air Patagonia. New outfit: via Caracas and Bogot . No catering. Four hundred and eleven pounds. Four one one. Good value, but refueling at Bogot  is variable.
Take all the time you like, doctor.
Both, sir.
Then what's the problem?
Do you think George is a fairy?
Maybe he's just a kooky guy who likes doing something kooky like that.
Maybe he's too flighty and irresponsible. That's why I asked if he was a fairy.
That's George.
That girl's making an awful spectacle of herself.
-- I hope you like Miss Shawn --
We cannot go into this later.
-- is that what this is all about?
I don't care about that girl, I don't care if she's dead.
I'm perfectly calm, George, I'm simply saying you have no respect for me, that you're incapable of distinguishing between me and one of your average Hollywood... mummers...
I've never been treated that way, and I'm not going to start now.
I don't know. I'm beginning to feel guilty.
Your husband?
No, I know.
Why didn't you come alone? Lester invited you. Did you have to bring her?
She what?
Sweetheart, it's a bore out there... let's lock the door.
Want me to?
Shit.
No kidding.
That you're just like your mother.
You do know what money's like these days.
George!
Yes, Buffums.
What!
So how's Norman?
Jesus...
-- Listen, I'm supposed to take Jill to El Cholo tonight. She's really going to be pissed if I don't.
You don't seem very sure.
... I don't get it done often.
Don't do it.
-- don't you want to --
No, I blew it, I blew it with Lester.
You don't think so? I do.
Where do you want to go?
Am I entertaining you?
What's wrong?
-- It's Malone's.
Do you know what that Lillian Bercovici just did?
-- Right after I sprayed her?
I'm busy, man.
-- you shouldn't talk to me like that no matter what, George... you know better...
-- you know better...
Jackie Shawn.
There were some shots.
I've had these dumb dreams lately.
They want me to go to Egypt for three weeks.
Go where?
When is that?
When is that, George?
A friend dropped me off.
Never mind. Where've you been?
What business meeting?
I know, honey.
Now, Jackie --
Yes.
-- and take this with you.
Obviously.
What do you wanna know for?
Baby, please don't... I love you.
Baby, don't do this --
I wish you'd go now.
Stop it.
George...
What're you here for?
You need a cut.
Oh, well, I went to beauty school... you know you go to beauty school... and you get your operator's license... and you graduate... and you're a hairdresser.
But what?
It's good you want to do something, George.
-- maybe you could, on your way, you know, pick up Jackie here.
Sorry, honey, I...
... she's very upset...
You look like you've had quite a work-out.
George, I know you have to deal with Felicia and you're caught in the middle, and if you can just bear with me tonight, well, I appreciate the way you've handled the situation.
It's a difficult situation, and I want you to know I appreciate it. Tonight's going to be real tough for me --
-- do me a favor, kind of keep your eye on Jackie, she's a little high strung tonight --
This really ought to be layered...
What do they look like?...
Sit down.
... You can lose it all; you can lose it all no matter who you are... I don't know, what's the point of having it all. Look at me. I don't have a goddam thing... the market's terrible right now, went down ten points last week, goddam Lyndon Johnson!
What about Jackie?
I mean, how did that happen?
Steve Slutes, and he's not a boy.  Steve couldn't get arrested as an actor. He couldn't get arrested as a boy.
Of course not.
George, glad you could make it, son. Hi, doll.
Poster-Kleiser.
Fine.
Face it, you can go around with cute guys and get hung up on their sexy bodies and things like that but sooner or later you've got to find somebody. Face it, time isn't on your side.
You're really a love -- you sure?
After four years? No I don't... and I don't know too many girls who do.
I would say so, yes.
-- See, I just know that if I go to Egypt, well, things happen, I just don't know what'll happen to us, he just never seems to think ahead, does he?
-- He came up behind me and I was wiping a dish and he just... lifted up my skirt, and, you know, right there...
-- He reached up and tore them.
Egypt?
-- oh, sure. A hairdresser. How... how do you a... meet a hairdresser?
George? Was he alone?
-- Jackie really shouldn't drink --
-- why?
You're kidding.
Johnny!  Why didn't you tell me before?
You seem disappointed.
I can't.  I have too much to do.
Did your mother ever say that to you - that I would hurt you?
Why don't you want to talk about it?
Yes.
Yeah.
We're just going to go into one of the other rooms for a few minutes and talk - then I'll come back and check on you, okay?
Danny?
Mommy... Mommy...!
But eh what was the matter with him?
haven't I seen you somewhere before?
Yes, sir.  I have a wife and eh two daughters, sir.
No.
Who?
How?
No need to rub it in, Mr. Grady. I'll deal with that situation as soon as I get out of here.
Just give me one more chance to prove it, Mr. Grady.  That's all I ask.
I fear that you will have to deal with this matter in the harshest possible way, Mr. Torrance.  I fear that is the only thing to do.
Good evening, Mr. Halloran.  What can I do for you?
Dick, if you're ready to do it now, I think it would be a good idea if you could show Mrs. Torrance the kitchen, while I continue on with Jack.
Glad to meet you, Winifred.
Mrs. Torrance, your husband introduced you as Winifred.  Now are you a Winnie or a Freddie?
Don't let it get you down Mrs. Torrance - it's big but it still ain't nothing but a kitchen... a lot of the stuff you'll never have to touch.
Bill, how do you do?
It's good to see you.
I'm the kind of man likes to know who's buying their drinks, Lloyd.
Sure is.
Eleven thirty - Jesus!
It's really nice up here, isn't it?
I'm not being grouchy.  I just want to finish my work.
You went into the room Danny said - to 237?
Shovellings out driveways, work in a car wash - any of that appeal to you?
Jack!
Stay away...!
I'll bring back a doctor.
Physically, it's not a very demanding job.  The only thing that can get a bit trying up here during the winter is eh... the tremendous sense of isolation.
I don't believe they did.
This is our Colorado Lounge.
This is the staff wing of the hotel. None of the other bedrooms are heated during the winter.
Thanks.
By five o'clock tonight, you'll never know anybody was ever here.
What time does the plane leave?
You always take his side because he's a cripple! Well, it's not my fault that he's a cripple!
Jane... you don't have to do that.
Are you all right, Marty?
Yeah, okay, the fireworks. Jane thinks that's all I'm mad about, but it's not. Them doing that is just a... a...
Yeah, Winesburg, Ohio, was never like that... but I got something that just might cheer you up.
You got a pilot's license, Marty?
Stay near the house, for Christ's sake- someone's killing people. I have to be out of my mind to be doing this, you know.
Was it a prescription?
I think he's going to come for me. Not just because I know who he is, but because I hurt him. Only I don't think he'll try again as Lowe.
Yeah? Really?
And don't open the door for any trick or treaters even if they come!
I can't wait until next Sunday, when the choir performs again.  Did you see the people walk right in from the street? That music, that heavenly music -- it called to them.
I must tell the Cardinal.  I.11 send him a personal letter, describing your efforts, your bold new fight to keep your little convent alive.
Yeah.  We all got caught.  Shoplifting. Cuttin' school.  Cuttin' up some bitch with a blade.  So we gotta come here.  So we'll be good, in the future.  So we'll learn valuable lessons.  And I learned mine.  I will be incredibly good, I will never rip out nobody's nose-ring by accident ever again.  Can I go now?
LET THY SPIRIT
But I'm fearful!
What you do?
Yeah, right to the cops.  No way.
Come on -- stay.  Just a little.  We can talk, I'll get a pizza.  Pizza in bed, we'll have fun.  And you still haven't told me what happened.  What did she say?
You are so damn sexy.
Babe, it's not me!  I love you!  It's God!
Sure.
Oh my! 
He's so dreamy.  He's like... a Greek god.  He's the cutest guy here.    He's boss.  He's fab.  He's...
HE'S SO FINE.
Hurry, Sister!
SING AND THE DEVIL WILL FLEE!
Which convent?  It was, um, the Little Sisters... of the Moonlight.  In Vegas. Everybody used to come to Mass.  Frank. Dean.  Sammy.  Right at ringside.
What?
Soprano or alto?
Very nice.  Sisters, have we learned our lesson?  I won't hold this little episode against anyone.  I'll try not to.
Yeah, for one second.  That was the blend -- you've got to listen to each other.  Be a group.
It'll be hell.
Don't look at your feet, and I don't want to see anybody counting.  Make it look easy.  Again!
She's a pro.
Is there any syrup?
JUST SING!
Thanks.  So which one are you? Sister Bruce?  Sister Doug?
Three years.  A rookie.
You have to help me
I have to do this.  So I can become a nun.
Wait, this isn't the way.  Who are you?
Mary Clarence!
BUT THE LORD CAME TO ME
A convent?  They put me in a convent? What's the problem?  Wasn't there any more room in Hell?
I joined this convent some thirty years ago.  At that time, the world knew some measure of peace.  And hope.  Our order was a beacon of hospitality, to families, to children, to a neighborhood filled with promise.  And, as the years have passed, I have watched that promise destroyed.  Drugs.  Gangs.  Spandex.  And. so I have made this convent an oasis, a retreat from horror. And now that horror has invaded these sacred walls.
Cool.  Is there a menu?  Or buffet?
This shall be your cell, Mary Clarence.
Right, sure thing.  But what about, like, appliances?  Like a little color portable?  Boom box?
What's wrong with my life?
I got it.
This is a convent, not a clinic.  We offer moral guidance, not hardware.
Hold on.  That's not fair.  I worked hard with them.  They gave up their free time, and they loved it.  Those women are happy.  And we can get even better.  We can wake this place up.
But -- there's so much more to do right here.  And look, if it's about me, I mean, I'm gone.
But everything that's happening is good! You can be a part of it!
Really?  And maybe shorter habits, and women priests, and sleeping late?
I used to buy.you,..stuff.  On your birthday .  When we were seeing each other.
All right!  I get the picture!  I'll do it!  I'll testify!
No nothing.
I just need a few more weeks,
What'd she say?
Does she know people are trying to kill me out there?
Eddie!  You scared the hell out of me!
It wasn't my fault!  They just showed up.  It's helping the convent.
Really?  Lieutenant?
You're not... seeing anybody?
People throw stones.  They call me names.  I mean, really.
Where's who?
And if she runs?
She's gettin' away!
What's she doing?
Are you going to shoot us all, tough guy?
We sound terrible   We need Mary Clarence.
Look what she did with the choir.  She made us sing beautifully.
We've got to save her!
Yes, Mary Patrick?
Bless her!  There are so many problems in this neighborhood that we could help solve.  That's why many of us became nuns.  It's marvelous, Reverend Mother.
Mary Clarence has a background in music. That's what Reverend Mother said.
Mary Clarence!  Sister!
It's so beautiful...
Absolutely not.  I am very sorry, but no.
We're a small convent, Bishop.  Surely there are... more appropriate shelters.
Excuse me, gentlemen, but... who has seen this Horseman?
It is sacrilege!
Oh?  Far as I can tell, a rumor does not travel alone for long here.
Wallowing quite literally in blood.
May I see them, Master Hardenbrook?
Just a moment... if I may.  It is possible this man was murdered.
He will be burned pursuant to statutes of health.
The Widow Windsor.
The Van Garretts died first; a man and his son, survived by a wife and two infants.  And the Widow Windsor was next...
It's spectacular.
What is it?
We should not go much further in this murk.
What does it mean... climb down to the Horseman's soulless place?
Then, who murdered the Old Crone?  And why?
Must be some sort of gateway.  But, why this place... ?
Someone left last night.  Looked like they headed to the square, but I lost them in the forest.
If someone has the Horseman's skull... if they control the Horseman, then why haven't they sent him for your head yet?
What good is this?
Often in such cases, property which has gone intestate legally passes to whomever the deceased was indebted to. And, who in this town is owed a great many debts?
Did your father take a loan?
What was she doing?
What books?
Did they tell?  It is something in the air so that dreams come to everyone.  According to the elders, an Indian prophet held powwows here before the land was taken, and spells cast then still linger to this day.
He only appears to be inside the cage.  The point being...
Oh, you are hopeless.  May I keep it at least?
Thank you.  No.  Here...
Very well.  But, it will only sit gathering dust.
And this gives worth to butchery?
It is only me.
I apologize if I worried you.
I have been reading your journal. I'm sorry.  I found it too fascinating to resist.  I rode to catch up with you at the Notary, out of curiosity.  Before I found you though, I overheard what you were said.
I have not been able to face him yet.
Yes, I have seen that, and I told you why I hid them.
Katrina...
The church.
Quickly, close it.
You said yourself.  What mere man could have downed the Belltower?
Can you help?
You... you are alive.
Imagine my surprise, finding him on a liason with a common servant.  A girl who had apparently become his secret love.
She has confessed.
I don't reckon.
Don't look much like he could. You say he can fix a small engine like nobody's bidness.
He won't steal. I'm tellin' you he's a pretty good ol' boy. Keeps to himself.
How 'bout you, Jerry.
Well, he's pretty quiet. Except for them rackets and breathin' things he does. Ain't threatened me with a killin' or anything.  But boy you couldn't of been more right about him fixin' things. That son of a bitch is a regular Eli Whitney on a lawnmower. Loves french fries. Eats four larges and don't even so much as belch. I'm proud to have him.
French fries. I like to eat them pretty good.
My name is Frank Wheatley. What's your name?
Well, it's not too big in here, is it?  I feel very generous today. I feel like listening. I'm sure you have plenty to tell me. And please bore me with the details.  ) Come on Karl, who did you kill? Was it the boy?
He'll be here in a little while, he's takin' me to get an ice cream.
You know what we ought to do tonight?
Well, it's on! We're gonna rock. Linda, call Vaughan. Tell him to get over here. I'd like him to be here. I owe him a good time.
Okay ladies and gentlemen  or both. It's come to the time in our show when we like to introduce the band. Over here on lead guitar Mr. Randy Horsefeathers. Come on hit a hot lick, Randy.  Well, come on, y'all are supposed to clap now. Come on! 
Leave.
Leave.
How'd your baptizin' go?
I want to watch T.V.
Come on, Karl, let's go out to the garage.
Now here's the deal. Now that I'm gonna throw my entire life away doin' what I want to come live here with y'all, we have to get a few things straight. See, Frank, me and you mama wouldn't have any problems if it wadn't for you. We'd never have a bad word between us. But since you do exist, if I'm gonna be here as the head of the household, we'll have to live by my rules. And my rules are you don't speak unless you're spoken to. Stay out of my way and do what a regular kid does. You're a weird little shit. I don't get you. So wake up. Face what they call reality. We're gonna be a family now. And it's my family. I'll be payin' the bills so you got me. But I ain't your daddy. You just treat me like I am. I'm the boss, okay. And the other thing is your friend Karl has to go. We can't have a normal family with him livin' in the garage and comin' in the bedroom at four in the mornin' with hammers and shit. See?
Hey, Vaughan, you know what I heard? I heard you been puttin' it to Albert Sellers that works over at the funeral home.
I'd better go on home now, it's late. I have to work tomorrow.
Are you sure you can drive? You've really had a lot of alcohol.
Can you go there with us now? Me and Karl. We could just hang out. Karl has some cool books.
Hey there. I thought I heard somebody on the porch. Wasn't your name Karl?
Yeah. What you doin' by here?
Maybe they needed it.
I'd like to kill that son of a bitch. I hate him.
I like the way you talk.
Hey Karl, you off work?
Boy, folks sure had it rough back a long time ago, didn't they?
Yeah, me too.  That was nice of that woman to give you them flowers.
I ain't got no money to get 'em with but I bet Vaughan will let me have some of them flowers at the store.
Just 'cause I'm not rich don't mean I don't love her.
What do you mean?
You don't seem like a daddy. You seem like a brother.  Wonder what makes you like somebody right off when you don't even know 'em like what happened with me and you.
'Cause it's fun. It don't matter if you ain't no good. It takes your mind off of everything else while you're doin' it. When you run real fast tryin' to make a touchdown you don't think about anything else. I ain't no good, but my daddy always said he was proud of me when I threw a ball or ran with it. Did you have any brothers and sisters growin' up to play with?
You threw it in a trash barrel?
I'll play ball with ye. I reckon if neither one of us is no count it won't make no difference.
Just diggin'.  I ain't ever gonna be happy now. Not with that son of a bitch movin' in for good. I wish me and you and Mama could just run away. But she said he would find us wherever we went. He's crazy. Sometimes I think it would of been better if I wadn't ever born.
Karl, I ain't tryin' to say nothin' bad about you, but why don't you stop Doyle when he gets that away? You're older than him. You're strong, too. My daddy wouldn't let him do that to me and Mama.
Yeah, I guess so. I'm real tired, you know that. A kid my age shouldn't be tired of things.
Yes sir.
Reckon what kind of a feelin'?
Karl, now listen, there's gonna be a party tonight here at the house. Doyle's invited his music-playin' buddies over to make a bunch of racket out on the patio.
You all right, Mama?
Yes ma'am, I reckon.
You walk fast, don't you?
That grass out in the yard's all growed up. I figured I might cut it fer ye.
Well, you can't do that. You're a free man. You've been let out to do as you please.
I know, I've seen it myself. Would you give that a try?
She's talkin' about me, Karl. That's my first name.
Hey, Vaughan. How are you, Karl?
Two fellers was on a bridge a takin' a leak and one feller says the water was cold and the other said it was deep water. One of 'em came from Arkansas, I believe.
Hit ain't right for me to keep from tellin' you how come me to be put in the state hospital.
You're a hell of a boy, Frank. Someday you're gonna get all the good things you deserve. And Karl here's gonna get some more biscuits tonight. What do you think about that?
Where are you goin', Karl? Didn't you want some chicken and things?
Where'd he go? What's goin' on?
Well thank you, hun. That's real good of you to say. I wouldn't know what to do without him either.
What brings you back?
Why are you here now?
Is that right?  Are you going to be staying here long?
Do you have family here?
Yes sir.
I done et just a little bit ago.
What about you, Karl? Do you want to stay here?
Are you sure it's safe to let him around that guy?
Let's just go, Marsha.
I think there must have been a little mix up. I told your sponsor or teacher or whatever he is, there couldn't be any pictures. It's s'posed to be just a little story or article or something, isn't that right?
He's free. His time's up. That's the rules. He's been treated and reevaluated. He doesn't show any signs any more.
Where will he go?
Ah-hah, I see. A cozy dinner. But aren't threesomes a little awkward? How does the phrase go--
I thought I recognized you. You're Paul Benjamin the writer, aren't you?
And your father? Is he from New York?
Your dissertation? What subject do you study?
What else. Of course, what else? And what are you writing about for your thesis?
Do me a favor, will you?
It's simpler, that's what. It makes things go faster.
Seven eighty-five out of twenty.  Take care of yourself now, and don't do anything I wouldn't do.
Do you think I could buy some before you leave?
Looks like someone forgot a camera.
It's yours?
A photographer ...
But they're all the same.
No. The ... uh ... the Bobbsey Twins lit out when they heard the sirens. But at least they stopped playing that marimba duet on my skull.  Assaultus interruptus.
So what did he say when he called?
Hey, man, how's it going?
Two, right?
Yeah, great. The problem is, I have four days to come up with something, and I don't have a single idea.  You know anything about Christmas stories?
So. Are we ready?
It was a good deed, Auggie. It was a nice thing you did for her.
At least I've stayed true to myself. Which is more than I can say about some people.
Stop it, already. Just stop all this crap right now.  Was that your idea to call her Felicity?
You've suckered me before, darling, remember? Why should I believe you now?
Yeah, well, I lost my pen. By the time I got a new one, I was clean out of paper.
You're conning me, sweetheart. I ain't responsible for no baby.
I told her she was going to meet her father.
Relax, okay? You don't have to do anything. Just go in there and pretend. It won't kill you to do a little favor like that. Besides, you might even learn something.
Wait till you see her, Auggie.
She looks just like you.
Jesus Christ. This is all I need.
Not if you got her into one of those rehab programs.
No thanks. I don't care what you do, but just make sure you don't get caught, okay? The last I heard, it was still illegal to sell Cuban cigars in this country.
What do you care where it comes from? It's yours.
It'll never be finished.
Seventy-eight dollars. The girl who rolled these was probably wearing panties.
A good choice. You wouldn't want to celebrate the birth of your firstborn with a box of stinkers, would you? Remember to keep them in the refrigerator until you hand them out.
It'll keep them fresh. If they get too dry, they'll break. And you don't want that to happen, do you?  Tobacco is a plant, and it needs the same loving care you'd give an orchid.
I just want to know what your game is, mister, that's all.
He goes to John Jay High School in Brooklyn.
He's in trouble, all right. But I don't have any idea what it is.
You going to sit here all day?
It's rundown, all right. But drawing a picture won't improve the way it looks.  Let's see what you did, Rembrandt.
I'll tell you what. You want to work. I'll give you a job. Nothing permanent, mind you, but that upstairs room over there  -- the one above the office -- is a hell of a mess. It looks like they've been throwing junk in there for twenty years, and it's time it got cleaned up.
Benefits?
And have you mended them?
You named the kid after yourself, huh?
It's only temporary. On a freelance basis.
Well?
You can do whatever you want with your own life. We're thinking of the baby, that's all. We want you to get yourself cleaned up for the baby. Before it's too late.
Your baby. The baby you're carrying around inside you.
What are you talking about?
I'll tell you why they're not going anywhere.
Watch out, man. You'll get yourself killed like that.
I just happened to be there.  The right place at the right time.
Are you sure you don't want some food to go along with it? It might help to absorb some of that liquid. You don't want to slosh around too much when you stand up.
Mostly what.
The what.  I've kind of run away from home, you see.  It has nothing to do with my parents or money. I saw something I wasn't supposed to see, and for the time being it's best that I keep myself out of sight.
I can take care of myself. Don't worry.
I didn't expect to see you again.
No, he was a schoolteacher. But he liked to dabble.
Twelve, thirteen years ago.  Actually, he died with his sketch pad open on his lap. Up in the Berkshires one weekend, drawing a picture of Mount Greylock.
Is that what you do? Draw pictures?
Jesus, do you make a lot of noise. Can't you see I'm trying to work?
Not a penny, not a stitch. I'm cool, man. 
Hey, it's you.
Cut it out, will you? Just cut it out and come back here.
Thanks. 
If I tell you, I might not be able to finish it.
Celebrate? What for?
Hey, hey. Happy birthday. Why didn't you tell me?
So you're saying it wasn't like that at all.
You'll do it, all right. You fuck up, you've got to undo the damage. That's how it works, buster. If you don't do it, I'm going to throw you out of here. Do you understand me? If you don't pay Auggie what you owe him. I'm finished with you.
Hi, kid.
Like it or not, Cyrus, that's my name. Cole. Just like yours.
Do you have real iced coffee, or do you just pour hot coffee over some ice cubes?
Seven acres.  I'm wonderin' what you'd pay for 'em.  Just curious, is all.
None.
Him and his folks and two brothers and two sisters worked our land. Lived in a picker's cabin at first.
Just three questions.  The Miyamoto family bought your seven acres for $4500?
Compressed air horn, most likely. Hope to God some man hears you in that fog.
You mean Miyamoto followed him out there, and sucker-punched him?
We discussed that.  And decided not to.
My mom.  Would be the problem.
I can just feel my spirits soar.
It's just Pearl Harbor.  People are a little crazy, right n...
We all expect the world to be fair. As if we have some right t...
They only arrested that poor soul because he's Japanese.
Greedy.
I asked you a question, you're writing a tract, h...
<u>Were</u> you, sir?  Can you <u>prove</u> one word of all your fancy story?
Mr. Jurgensen.  Did he offer to <u>buy</u> the seven acres from you?
Sheriff said right off, I was under suspicion.  I didn't have a lawyer...
My apologies.  Do you regret not telling the truth?
They got transferred that day. Out to Cape Flattery.
You said three minutes.
It's on the twine, too.  But it's not r...
It's the way it happened, I know it is.
This tastes horrible, hmmn?
Miyamoto gave him the battery, and left.  Carl's boat was running, he goes back to fishing.  But at some point, he thinks of the lantern...
He figures a perfectly good lantern could get banged around up there.  So he climbs up.  To cut it down.
Coincidences happen.  You run a yellow light <u>just</u> as a car comes out of nowhere.  Split-second tragedy happens every day.  Or maybe...
Maybe Carl picks up something about the freighter on his radio, which is now working.  Same report Milholland heard.  And <u>that</u> makes him get the lantern fast.  Before the freighter's wake can bang it around.
You think so?
Cigarette?
If I whistle.  Those boys'll see you, and come runnin'.  <u>You're</u> the story today.
Sheriff, I can't afford not to fish toni...
What makes you think I play?
I'm more a hot-blooded killer, huh? Like a soldier.  Like a samurai.
Does it now?
You found three batteries, you say.  A D-6 and D-8 in the well. And a spare D-8 on the cabin floor. Correct?
I believe so.
So if his head struck something narrow and flat, the gunnel of a boat, a net roller, a fairlead, could that have...
Is it fair to say that you do not know for <u>certain</u> which it was.
I guess you'd have to guess. Not having been there with them. Having to guess whether your husband's report was word for word accurate.
Carl ever say <u>he</u> got one?
Sorry about that, Mrs. Heine. Shall I repeat the ques...
Okay, doll.
Because I'm working the night shift - and I got a bottle of gin stashed away - and as soon as there's a lull -
Which of you dolls is Daphne?
It's from Satchel Mouth at Table Seven.  This is from me to you, doll.
Pardon me, Mr. Bienstock - can I have my flask back?
Say, boss - I been talking to some of the other delegates - and the word is that Little Bonaparte is real sore about what happened to Toothpick Charlie.  Him and Charlie, they used to be choir boys together.
He even got Charlie's last toothpick - the one from the garage - and had it gold-plated.
Say, Joe - tonight's the night, isn't it?
I mean, we get paid tonight, don't we?
But suppose he loses?
Of course, the landlady is going to lock us out - Moe said no more knackwurst on credit - and we can't borrow any more from the girls, because they're on their way to jail -
Sam the Bookie?  Nothing doing!  You're not putting my overcoat on that dog!
But we'll freeze - it's below zero - we'll catch pneumonia.
You mean it's a girls' band?
Who are we kidding?  Look at that - look how she moves - it's like jello on springs - they must have some sort of a built-in motor. I tell you it's a whole different sex.
Not there - that's the emergency brake.
You'd better go fix it.
This way, Daphne.
I changed it.  It used to be Sugar Kowalczyk.
Forget it.  One false move, and they'll toss us off the train - there'll be the police, and the papers, and the mob in Chicago...
But suppose I got to go - like for a drink of water?
Male and female - the moth and the flame - I ought to slug you!
So you got pinched in the elevator. So what?  Would you rather be picking lead out of your navel?
Me?  After Sugar?
I heard a very sad story about a girl who went to Bryn Mawr.  She squealed on her roommate, and they found her strangled with her own brassiere.
He's not only got a yacht, he's got a bicycle.
And where's he going to be?
With ME?
Because we're pals - buddies - the two musketeers.
Hi, Jerry.  Everything under control?
WHAT?
I'll say there is!
Jerry, listen to me - there are laws - conventions - it's just not being done!
That's some nerve!
Joe, if we get out of this hotel alive, you know what we're going to do? We're going to sell the bracelet, and grab a boat to South America and hide out in one of those banana republics -  The way I figure is, if we eat nothing but bananas, we can live there for fifty years - maybe a hundred years - that is, if we get out of the hotel alive.  Did we forget anything?
Sugar?
OH!
When I was a little girl, on cold nights like this, I used to crawl into bed with my sister.  We'd cuddle up under the covers, and pretend we were lost in a dark cave, and were trying to find out way out.
Why you poor thing - you're trembling all over.
And you've got cold feet.
Look, Sugar, if you feel you're coming down with something, the best thing is a shot of whiskey.
How's the bottle?
So spill it.  Spills, thrills, laughs, games - this may even turn out to be a surprise party.
Yeah - Josephine.
What do you mean, maybe?  I saw the way he looked at you.  He'll be there for sure.
Did he get fresh?
Thirty-four.
Brand new.
Where did you girls play before?
What's wrong with us?
We could dye our hair.
Yes, I'm holding on.
Let me carry one of the instruments.
It certainly is delightful to have some young blood around here.
Oh, of course.  which of these instruments do you play?
Fascinating.  Do you use a bow or do you just pluck it?
My last wife was an acrobatic dancer - you know, sort of a contortionist - she could smoke a cigarette while holding it between her toes - Zowie! - but Mama broke it up.
I don't care.
I don't like no witnesses.
Anything today?
What are you - a couple of comedians? Get out of here!  Long distance?  Get me the William Morris Agency in New York.
The wrong shape?  You looking for hunchbacks or something?
Well, here we are.
On the Baltimore and Ohio.
Me?
Yeah.
You don't say?
I want mine to wear glasses.
Why not?
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
I'm not interested at all.
How's the stock market?
No - the ukulele.  And I sing.
Yeah.  Real hot.
They do indeed.  Daddy threatened to cut me off without a cent, but I don't care. It was such a bore - coming-out parties, cotillions -
- opening of the Opera -
Well, I guess I'd better go -
Well, he's young and handsome and a bachelor - and he's a real gentleman - not one of these grabbers.
I guess he's not going to show up - it's give minutes to one - you suppose he forgot?
You heard her - yes.
Been waiting long?
It looked so small from the beach - but when you're on it, it's more like a cruiser - or a destroyer.
Look at all that silverware.
Where's your shell collection?
What thing?
Yes - all the money in the world - but what good is it?  Mint sauce or cranberries?
How much do I owe the Milk Fund so far?
That's wonderful.  Poor Josephine.
I'll meet you on the pier again - right after the show.
Oh - that kind of a merger.  Is she young? Pretty?
I only wish there were something I could do for you.
Quit kidding.  You did that vulcanizing job on Toothpick Charlie - and we know it.
That's very refreshing. Now what's the password?
Look, Chief - I better blow now, because if Spats Colombo sees me, it's Goodbye Charlie.
Yeah.  You never know who's going to be next.  Okay, Spats.  Report to the Sergeant- at-Arms.
Just dropped in to pay my respects.
You know what I love about all this?
Why don't you get my half sister her seventh hole?
I don't think I can go through with this.
You know what? I'm not having this conversation right now.
Wow. You look beautiful.
Where's Nick sleeping?
Mom's refining her strategy for DDay.
Anyway, when that boy came over, it was the first time you ever did anything without her.  And Amy wasn't just jealous...she was sad and lonely. She missed you.
I think I love you, mate.  How do you know so much about so much?
What's his problem?
And Kat was fully clothed.
Crikey.
Nothing, nothing.
Hey, you!
So, tell me, how's unmarried life?
You were so good to me. I swear I never meant to hurt you. We were together what, five years?
It's the past. It's nothing but ghosts. So just get it off your chest, then let's go back upstairs and eat some tiramisu.
Hi. Hey.
No, count it, anyway.
That won't be an issue, believe me. I find the idea of sex for money morally repugnant.  No offense.
Not the way you're thinking. The women wanted me there for support. You can understand that.
Would you grab my shampoo?
You shit!
And you thought I'd respond to the hippie stripper with no boundaries?
There's a guy on 81st and Madison. You get your results in 24 hours.  Do you make your lovers get tested before you sleep with them?
I love that you're asking questions, but do you really want to get into all of this?
Come on.
Don't they have a limit at those machines?
So you're telling me. If something had happened last night...it would have cost me fourteen hundred dollars? That's a down payment on a Ford Focus!
You have had girlfriends?
Yeah. You?
You're right. I was so desperate to make everyone believe I was happy that I spent six grand on a lie. And after all that? The only one who ended up falling for it was me.
You want I nut him in the boat?
So why'd you let him go?
I just wanta wash my hand. It's got blood where I hurt it.
That does it...
You got a pretty house, Miss Johnson!
Here it is, right here.
Clarence, would you tell us a story that was not true, after telling us it was?
:--THE STRANGE ENDINGS OF NATURE THEY HAVE SEEN, MAY GIVE THE WORLD NEW POINTS OF VIEW AND MAKE THEIR LOVING, LIVING, AND DOING PRECIOUS TO ALL HUMAN...
:...HEARTS. AND TO THEMSELVES IN THESE DAYS THAT TRY THEIR SOULS...
I can't do it, Rita -- that's the policy here on colored prisoners, and I ain't about to change it, not even for a friend like you.
I see you found what you was lookin' for.
No buts, Rita!
If anybody's to blame, it's me -- I oughta nailed him when I took that shot.
When the fall comes in these parts, the Night moon runs away like a rabbit -- you could stay out here lookin' all night, and not see a thing out yonder.
Yep. I guess you must wonder why though, what with the luck we havin', but like I always say--
Mama is outside with Josie Mae and Earl.
And me too, son! You shore done got to be such a big little man!
You bet we is!
Goodnight, Daddy...
I love you, son! Don't ever think I don't love you!  We gon' get to be friends?
What's your daddy's name?
Mister, can you visit anybody here?
Do you know my daddy, Nathan Lee Morgan?
Miss Boatwright --
See you tomorrow, Miss Boatwright.
He eats all right -- his throat ain't scarred.
He will... Come on, git down and act like a possum.
Who's winning, Mama?
Can I go when the holiday comes?
So did I. I figured when the time got right, we could all take a day or two and walk up there, but it's not the kind of long trip for a child to take alone.
So when I left, she gave me these books.
It's about the Three Musketeers.
But I saw you -- you looked in there, and you found out, Miss Boatwright.
Hi ya doin' there, Ike?
Whatcha wanta order?
Night, son!
How's the weather out there?
The most important thing is that you're home!  We was gonna have cold eatin' tonight, 'cause of the heat, but now, I'm goin' to cook!
Where you goin'!?
Howya do, Rebecca. I sorta been expectin' you this mornin'.
That's the way they do things here in Landsdown. I just follow orders.
What...
YOU JUST DON'T CARE!
BECAUSE IT'S EVIL!!
Patient 453 here has been fitted with the new v-chip...
Don't worry about that. Now, I want you to say 'Doggy.'
Notice that nothing happens.  Now say 'Montana.'
Eric! Did you just say the "F" word?
Why the fuck not?
What is this?
How come Terrance and Phillip are so weird looking?
Dude, that movie was fucking sweet!
Suck my balls.
I bet him he couldn't do it... I bet him a hundred dollars!
Did you bring the pie and punch?
Cartman?!
Goodnight, honey.
Eric?! Eric, what is it?!
Ugh... You guys, seriously... I'm having Cheesy Poof withdrawal...
You've got a stupid accent too.
The N word?
Oh yeah.
You bastards.
We can't, we're on a hunger strike.
Look at that!
What's the secret to making a woman happy?
Oops, I guess you haven't got that far in your anatomy class, huh?
Chef, what does it mean that we're at war?
What do you mean?! I could leave him if I wanted to!
Mph mph.
Mrph?
Kyle, you take your little brother out to play with you!
YOU GOTTA BE FUCKING KIDDING ME!!
So... We must free more Canadian prizoners?
Do you see them?  Do you see Terrance and Phillip?
That's gonna take a long time!
Dude, we don't have watches.
What's a butfor?
Be careful, dude.
<b>Thank my lucky stars Here before me now Is everything I'd ever hoped for Knew it in a word Saw it in a glance The only thing I think I'd die for...</b>
Nowhere.
That British dickhole is what's taking Wendy away from me!
Wow, dude. Wendy could really give a rats ass about you.
"Found Eight Million Pages With the Word Clitoris"!
Dude, do you know what you're doing?
I thought you had something planned.
Mom, I'm a man. Just a man. And I'm going to have fun with profanity just like you and dad did when you were little.
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?! We need to stop the not pretty things from letting our children be born in hospitals!
Shiteater-
I'm needing lunch.
Terrance and Phillip are two VERY untalented, unfunny actors from Canada. Their TV show is filled with toilet humor and bad language and is just complete garbage.  Now it appears they have a movie and I'm positive it's not suitable for children!
We must take action on this immediately.
How is the children's progress?
You'd fuck your uncle!
Good one, Phillip!  Cheers.
Did you hear that, Terrance? I farted!
Oh, a new recruit, huh? Welcome to hell, kid! Relax! Take a load off!!
You know I do.
What did you do today Satan?
No, Saddam. You made a deal. You can't just renege on a deal. That's lying.
Now do what I say and keep your fucking mouth shut!
We saw the Terrance and Phillip movie!
My friend the clitoris told me.
No, dude. Fuck him. Fuck him in the ear.
Check.
Will you two please stop it!  I don't want to spend my final hours listening to you bitch!
Anna...
Uh, yes I am.  And you are?
Oh, thank you.
Well I appreciate that.
And what are they doing now, Mac?
Mac, you really earned your wings this flight.
There is a high level...of passenger 					dissatisfaction.
I think I can handle it.
No.  I'm all set.  Thanks.
If anyone can hear me please respond!
Barnes, can you hear me, are you all right?
Break it down to me, what's going on?
So, what are we waiting for?
Now I got enough air and supplies to make another complete orbit in the pod!  You're just gonna have to pick me up later.
Is that clear?
Ryan Taylor, first mate.  Welcome aboard.  First time in space?
Well I don't think there's a chance of that happening.  It's usually the moon walks.  Sometimes you feel like a kindergarten teacher.
I don't think you know what you're talking about.  Besides, what could we use for tools?  A steak knife?  A corkscrew?
And suppose you couldn't hold out?
We could send Mac.  If he can retrieve one suit, we could go back for the other.
He certainly is polite.
It must be oxygenated if we can hear him.
If I could get to the bridge I could send the distress signal.
You're ready for the real thing?
Well, Dawn, I'm an optimist by nature.
Don't worry about what will happen, just concentrate on what is happening.  You'll live longer.
So close...
What is it?!
Thank you.
So I've been told.
I haven't quite made up my mind yet.
Officer Taylor, how are you this evening?
I need you to actually do something for me.  I need to access your CPU, directly.
Now Mac, can you tell me the status of this deck?
Mac, what about the suit compartments on this level?  Can they be accessed?
Is it safe for human transport?
Did you hear about that bowler who got smeared? I saw them pull a body bag out of the alley. I heard he was kacked but good. They had to take apart the pin machine to get him out.
You have orange whips?
Haven't seen a ball like that since '69.
Your pop said to put these on his tab. Sid gets up and jerks his thumb towards the door.
Hello Mr. Kastle.  Junior, long time. I thought they locked you up and threw away the warden!
Did you know you were parked in the handicap space?
Think he bought it?
It's a beautiful thing.
Ten thousand to one, but you pegged it. The toughest shot on the last frame.
Orange whip, nectar of the bowling gods. Thanks sweetie. Millie turns the tray so that Buzz takes the untainted whip.  Theo takes the other glass.
Watch out for that one. She's got a great average, but she's looking for a prince. And, believe me, she's 
It's gonna be bigger than big. Think Europe. Think Asia. They don't have room for real golf courses in Japan.
What the fuck is this?
I'm more of a bowler than you'll ever be. I deal with my own shit. I ain't asking anyone to bail me out.
He'll be a barnacle on your ass the rest of your life.
Not for somebody who hit a man with his ball on national television.
You never even took the shot. You couldn't do it. Theo moves towards Buzz in a threatening manner.
It could just as easily have been me in that box.
I looked in his car. He's got pictures of you, clippings, maps.
Son?
It depends.
No, Junior, you shouldn't touch her.
Junior.
Come on, Junior. Everyone's waiting for you, son. The beam of light catches Junior's face. He is crouched inside the machine at lane six. Jr. His face is cut and bleeding and his straitjacket torn and filthy.
I have someone for you to play with Junior.
Someone gonna get kacked, boss?
So you're Buzz's boy. I've been expecting you. You hurt my feelings when you didn't come and see me sooner.
Nobody sticks a finger into a bowling ball in this town without Miles Kastle knowing about it. You don't mind if I have a word with Theo, do you bunny? Kastle takes Theo by the elbow and pulls him away.
What's with the bad air between you two, Mr. Kastle?
There's a lot of competition for amusement out there. You gotta adapt to survive.
You already have a partner Mr. Kastle. Sheila walks over as the sleazeballs' car pulls out of the driveway.
Hello, Mr.Kastle.
132, 154.
Is Mr. Fazeli in please?
I'm a bowler.
Buzz Fazeli never helps anybody but himself.
What's your specialty?
Do those two work for your dad or mine?
Business.
Mind if I cut in?
You and your sideburns are the talk of the party, Theo.
Do you have a girlfriend?
So this brother of yours is hazardous to the health of your dates?
Unfortunately what he wants is you.
So you're hoping Buzz can get you re- instated?
What's plan B?
What are you going to do about your brother?
Yeah, what did Buzz Fazeli ever do for you?
I can't - I can't do it.  He's my brother.
Oh great! He tried to kill me! You knew he would go off if he thought I fooled around with you.
You wanted me to kill him, didn't you?
He's dead Sheila.
If Junior finds us, he'll kill us both.
Now he's the one who's locked up and I'm the one who's free. If I gotta do this alone, I might as well start now. She revs up and peals out.
You guys got something going on downstairs?
They're warm.  I can feel the heat on my legs.
The surface ships will be back. After the storm clears.
Back at the door -- I asked you to back away.
There are procedures, Beth, that I want followed.  My procedures.  And considering what's going on, I want you to follow them very closely.
A squid?  The size of a whale?  I don't think so.  Target acquired.  Sixty yards.
Where is it?
Increase positive pressure!
Thank you, Colonel.
Good.  Security's been our biggest worry.  Now that you're here we can shut this thing down tight.
We're moving fast considering the storm.
Extraordinary, isn't it?
Maybe we shouldn't.
You mean, what's in that thing is immortal?
She put a razor to her wrists a day later.
-- I didn't know it would come to this --
He translated it wrong.  "My name is Jerry"?  It's like "See Spot run."
You don't think weapons are important?
Bullshit.  What's out there isn't alien.  It's an animal.
I see it.
It's not sucking, sir.
Get him out of there.  I thought I told you people --
Subs are still at surface, sir.
How much damage?
We know how this craft got here. Where it's been.
Or it could contain some great benefit to us, some astonishing new idea or technology to help mankind.
... spiralling out of the center, you see: "G" is one, "B" is two, "H" is three, and so on... when I got the message.
Are you enjoying yourself, Harry, because I don't know what the hell you're doing.
With an "o".  Harold with an "o".
Ted, get her away from the door.
Some sort of lead or something.
What's wrong?
Can I stay, sir?  I'm willing to risk it.  I am.  After what we just witnessed.
She says jellyfish are a delicacy. You know, I never knew that.
To the spacecraft.  To investigate.
What do you expect?  For them to bring it up here?
Isn't there a psychological term for that, Dr. Johnson?
We have a library?
... when I was six, my younger brother and I -- we went swimming in the Pacific.  At my mother's beach house.  We both felt stinging, and when we came out of the water, he was wearing jellyfish head to toe. Killed him.
You knew about the squid not being normal.  Before Fletcher went out there?
I mean, I'm not... I wasn't absolutely sure if... they --
I didn't do anything wrong.  I didn't mean...
... He lied to us.  He left us down here.
He's not just a Navy captain -- he works for the fucking Pentagon.
You said something to him, didn't you?
Forget the sub.
The sub's a 100 feet in front of you.  You see it?
What's the matter?
Getting food.  We were out of food. what's wrong?  You sound mad.
Fixing it?  But I fixed --  Where'd you get all that?
You don't believe me.
He must not realize he is.  Like the Navy crewman -- Harry was sleeping then.  He must've manifested his dream.
"20 cc's of parasolutrine in combination with 6 cc's of paracin given IV produces deep sleep suitable for emergency surgical procedures... no cardiac side effects ... REM activity is surpressed... "
To be on the safe side.  I mean --
You ever given an injection before.
Not believing you.
What is it, Norman?
How do you feel about snakes?
Why did you go in the sphere, Beth?
Someone did.
That's when you went in the sphere.
Don't, Beth.  Please.
Would it work?
I don't get it.
What are you looking for?
Yes you did.  Norman, I wouldn't leave you out there.  You know that.
What?
They're going to want answers and they're going to keep asking until they get them.
Don't be defensive.
Don't be so optomistic, Harry.
So, <u>we know</u>.  We know it went through a black hole.  We saw it.  Norman -- when we'd get to the surface, we'd tell someone about the black hole, wouldn't we?  It'd go in some report like some big discovery.  So in fifty years when they build that ship, they'd make precautions for a black hole.  <u>But they didn't</u>.  The called it an Unknown Entry Event.
It's what's in that sphere, isn't it, Harry?  Whatever you think is in that thing -- you think it's going to kill you.
What is that?  That noise?
Three fifty-six, three fifty-five, three --
C'mon, Norman!
Gimme a second --
What does Norman already know?
You don't think it does?  I think it's rather obvious.
If it is a message, it's probably a substitution code.  I'll work on it.
What'd you say?
Beth and Harry?
By the way sir, I've read your report.  I think it's brilliant.
Must be another Johnson then.  Been flying so many scientists out here -- can't keep everyone straight.
Strange, isn't it?  In the middle of the ocean no less.
Strange, isn't it?  You know -- how it would have a button.
Well, how about we wait and see what Harry comes up with?
Frankly, Ted, I'd be much happier if Jerry was just a cold, emotionless intellect.
You think Jerry has something to do with what killed Edmunds?  With what's out there?
What kind of a crash was it?
Well, I can't imagine five years of unemployment --
Well, we'll see...
I think there are some things we should talk about.
Don't look at me.  I'm just a pilot. I got you here... You've got to do the rest.
That's straight through the central core... up toward the top of the city... Once you've got her, avoid the main transports, they'll shut down immediately.  Your only chance is through the service shafts. There are no sensors there... All right now, get going, you don't have time.  I hope you can remember everything.
Good morning!
Sorry, but that was the only way to get you down.
I assure you my intentions weren't bad.
I'm afraid I've gotten too old for this sort of thing.
I had one, but it was taken at the battle of Condawn...
We don't have that kind of money. How much do you think I can get for the speeder?
What's wrong?  What's happening?
What is it?
See, once you let yourself go you can do it.  You'll get it.
Blue Five, does that glare bother you?
I'm right behind you, Blue Leader.
All the data banks in Artoo are still secure.
Maybe you should just drop us off. I'm sure we can find someone willing to take the risk.
No, it's impossible... No one, and I mean no one would venture anywhere near the Alderaan system... I'm a free booter, not revolutionary.  You're aboard the wrong ship, son!
It's only light that doesn't affect it.  Solid things, like rocks, can hurt it!  Fire above him!
Get to the ship!
I don't pick up any life form concentration down there.  She'd better be right.
Are there medical facilities on Yavin?
I said we'd see.  And as it is, I was forced to borrow your academy savings to buy the new 'droids.'  When you've saved it up again, I'll let you go.
Not unless you could get me into the military academy at Anchorhead.
Tell me where you've been.  I am going to become a startrooper and fight in the wars.  My father was a Jedi!  Were you in many battles?
According to my father's tapes, this is the spot where General Kenobi lives, but the instruments just don't match up with the landscape... There is no doubt about it, we're lost...
I think we're going to need them. Blast it!
You got some guts for a rich kid. I guess you and me could be buddies.
Are you rated to repair a Marauder power suit, Rico ?
Then why did you order your man to remove his helmet during a live fire exercise ?
Did you read her mind ?
I've been thinking about applying for Federal Service, too. Fleet, maybe.
Eight point... no, uh, seven...
Please continue, Sergeant.
So what are you doing later ?
Assistant insructor... You must be some kind of a hot stick. Should I call you "sir" ?
Well, whad'ya know...
Carmen...?
I'm sorry, Carmen.
That girl who died on the way up ...his girl ?
I thought you were going to help Carl.
Zander is going for pilot, too.
Are you the boy for me ?
Everyone's looking... we shouldn't...
Hey, Carl, what's wrong ?
I'm gonna miss you.
What happened to your hair ?
...I'm sorry.
Almost got knocked out of the sky over Big K.
Take care, wilya Johnny ?
Steady as she goes, number one. Prepare for warp. Number two, design for Jupiter orbit.
A lot can happen in three minutes.
What ?
Cover me.
Johnny, people get hurt... people get killed in the Federal Service. If something happened to you I don't know what I would do...
Oh, my, what's that ?
No, Mr. Rasczak doesn't do that at all. He sorta discourages you really.
A trip to the Outer Rings. Whad'ya think of that ?
I'm telling you, you will ! You're not going back. You're going to go on vacation !
Wait you two. Dad and I have a surprise for you that will settle this. Can you guess what it is ?
Well, yeah, sure...
On whose authority, Corporal ?
What do you think you're doing ?
Don't be a hero...
What is your position ?
You. Tell me the moral difference, if any, between the citizen and the civilian ?
What's that look like to you, Rico ?
Who is...'V'ger'...?
Where is Lt. Ilia?
Why does V'ger travel to the third planet of the solar system directly ahead?
The examination is a normal function.
<U>Why</U>...?!
The carbon-units are not responsible for that.
Yes.
That's why you're staying aboard. I'm sorry, Will.
We'll have to replace Commander Sonak. I'd still like a Vulcan there, if possible...
Recommend defensive posture, Captain: Screens and shields.
    , if we do not provide     V'ger with certain information, we won't have twenty-two <U>seconds</U>; the plan must be implemented upon arrival.
Exactly.  And you did have a 'relationship' with Lieutenant Ilia, Commander.
That transmitter is a vital link between V'ger and the Creator. 
Jim... he <U>wants</U> it.
Hello, Ilia.
Negative control from inertial lag will continue 22 point five seconds before forward velocity slows to sub-light speed.
Was he difficult?
That you left? or that you didn't say 'goodbye'?
Lieutenant Ilia reporting for duty, sir.
Time to impact...?
Five minutes to Cloud boundary!
Mr. Spock?
Thirty seconds to Cloud boundary...
I appreciate the welcome; I wish the circumstances were less critical.  Epsilon Nine is monitoring the intruder; keep a channel open to them.  Where is Captain Decker?
Hold station.
Maneuvering thrusters, Mr. Sulu; ahead one third.  Full sensor scan, Mr. Spock; they can't expect us <U>not</U> to look them over now!
Clear the bridge, Captain...?
We're hoping it's only a temporary problem, Admiral...
I still contain fragments of my human half.
We are obviously confronted by a highly advanced mentality... yet they cannot understand who we are, or what we want.
Recommend we proceede, Captain.
That vessel is generating a forcefield measurably greater than the radiation of the Earth's sun.
Captain, we have been seized by a tractor beam...!
Klingons... our Epsilon 9 station ... and Ilia!! They seem to be more than just images...
What should you have known?
These read as identical composition...  ... however, Captain, they measure several hundred times more powerful!
V'ger plans to literally <U>meld</U> to reduce both itself and the Creator to patterns...
Spock, we <U>were</U> its answer!
... and the 'foolish' emotions which drive us?
You've received your appointment as Enterprise Science Officer?
Why aren't you on board?
Here at Starfleet...? The Enterprise is in final preparation to leave dock...
Twelve! I'm on my way to a meeting with Admiral Nogura which will not last more than three minutes. Report to me on the Enterprise in one hour.
Dock control reports ready, sir.
Negative helm control, Captain! Going reverse on impulse power...!
Cal...
Other one has history, too.  I wrote my play on it.
I quit.
I quit the movie.
Why?
Of <u>mercy</u>...off...
...that...he <u>sees</u> that...
Goodbye.
...that's what the swing is <u>there</u> for...thats its <u>purpose</u>, <u>isn't</u> it...
...who...?
...the, the, the symbol of the fire...
<u>How</u>...?
What happened?
...lost the screw...
Fix my glasses.
It's for your finger.
Later on.
Would you like to <u>see</u> it?  I've got the key back at my store...
I've been thinking: look at this: we live up here...
...and we could get up every morning...
Lookit that, up already.
What am I gonna do?
I...I <u>think</u> that's right...
And I might have something important to tell you...
What, what what are you doing here?
"The mill grinds the grain, but the grain is not destroyed.  <u>Although</u> it is altered..."
We did...?
I have to tell you something...
I wasn't doing business.
Yes, Maude, it is.  It is a <u>very</u> good play.
He had a hard day.  Ann's deserted him for some guy on the movie.
What courthouse?
<u>Wonderful</u> scr...
Rewrites that Bob Barrenger requested... the "dead horse scene," the...
Marty, it's Howie Gold on the coast, he needs your confirmation on a request for money...?
Because, because...we don't <u>have</u> to build an Old Mill -- they <u>have</u> an Old Mill -- <u>yeah</u>.  It's on a stream -- that's where you <u>put</u> a mill.
Whyn't you learn your lines?
I saw Desert Sun, I wanna tell you...
Isn't he...
What do you drink?
...wouldn't that be dangerous?
Her...
Tell it with...
So you see what I'm <u>saying</u>...the movie is about <u>purity</u>...
We're going to discuss the scr...you wanna come along...?
...I have to give you this <u>ticket</u> for damage to city property.  I'm really sorry, Sir, it's a formality, I hope you'll excuse...
What's his name?
And I have Mr. Barrenger's Tuna B...
I, well, you know, I tried to take him, in his room.
It's a mistake.  It's all over.  I'm sorry that we've inconvenienced you.
I want to tell you something, Wally, he's a pussycat.  <u>My</u> thing is to see everybody does what they said they would and I have to do that.  Now:  what is this you want <u>Eight Hundred Thousand Dollars</u> to do what you're being paid to, you already <u>signed</u> you'd do...?  What is that?
I want you to hear this.
Matzoh!  Are you Jewish?
Look.
Look, look, I like you <u>very much</u>...
...we had a script conference...
Claire, when did you...
You can't do what?
Fuck flowers, we aren't talking about flowers, we're talking about a human being.
...I...
And you know what...?
An artist of your caliber...
...I know, I'm so...because I said: yes, a woman who...the...the community <u>respects</u> her.  Please don't go.  Please don't go.  What can I do but beseech you...?  Trauma, <u>toil</u>...when are we free of them...?  When...?
I'm so comfortable with that, Walt, I can't <u>tell</u> you...
No, are you kidding me, Bob, not at all.
"Bring it in on time and there's more where these came from.  Marty.  P.S. I want to talk to you about a product tie- in..."
Somebody make a note.  I want Li..., for the broad...what does she like?  Lilacs. Okay.  A truck of lilacs when the broad comes.  And get something for Bob Barrenger, get him, what does he like...?
Did she throw up?
Why not?
-- she's got 'religion.'
Why?
...little woman has gone crazy about our dinner party...City Council...?  What's the trouble...?
Doug, the traffic light...
...he's the producer of the movie.
Doug...
She was in the car with Bob Barrenger last night.  And she was injured coming home from a love tryst, so...
Well you guess what.  The Mayor sent me. I have your Mr. Barrenger with a history of...
Hi.
I...
What's in the case?
I'm looking for the writer.
Half a buck I'd close it down...it's per...you know, it's perfidy, you got your Barrenger, molesting little girls...
I had a witness I would.
You know, the rape, to...even to the accident...
Who's White...?
We can't shoot in the Old Mill.
I...
It's about a man who gets a second chance.
Why?
I've got a date.
Let's speak English.  You've got to help the side.
Then you're finished in show business.
Hi!
<u>Siddown</u>!
You can't write it?
How do they know that, you told them?
I was walking down the street...I remember, I was writing a...
It's lovely.
My oh my.
I don't got the money.
I got a company...give us a million dollars, put their product in the film.
IT'S A COMPUTER COMANY...IT'S A COMPUTER COMPANY, <u>BAZOOMER</u>-<u>COM</u>?
NO NO NO NO NO, PAY HER OFF.  DID YOU HEAR ME?
Do something.
The chairs go, the Lazyboy goes...
...we don't have thirteen at table...
You hear that?
Drive a man to drink.  Took me near half an hour, get across the street yesterday.
He's going to <u>get</u> that calf.
You see where Tom Miller's playin' the Old Farmer?
But I couldn't r'member all the words. Ast them would they gimme a second chance.
Annabelle sucked her thumb last night.
I'm gonna call him.
Probably you -- your brother -- school -- The solar system...The usual...
Look she's upset --
Wow.  Who's that for?
...I mean, she knows all the music, and pop stars, and clothes and stuff. She's like still a kid, herself.
I know how scared <u>I</u> get when <u>you're</u> sick.  So I waited to tell you.  Until it was getting smaller. I thought that was best, maybe I was wr...
We make mistakes.  And we forgive each other.  Because we love each other, very m...
I said...
He wouldn't know.  <u>I</u> saw her in the shower!
Actually.  I could only help him.
You don't like his friends.
He's not even there.  You don't see him, you don't hear him, you're just too much of a woman to bother with little boys.
I'm gonna beep daddy at work.
This is my house too!
Lunch time Sleeping Beauty.  Where's Ben?  Is he in the bathroom?
C'mon, these are the Bomb, I prom...
Annabelle, I know you miss your mother.  So why don't you say hello.
Annabelle pick up the phone.
That doesn't bother me.
No.  I think it's ugly.
Now is that little prick still here, because if he is, I'm gonna rip his fucking <u>heart</u> out!
And you<u>don't</u> tell her.  What you're going to say.
Great.  Big ears, too?
In high school.
You know, this horse smells really bad.
No!  Cocoa Puffs on Top -- Fruit Loops on the bottom.
But you told us to starve.
...EGGzactly.  I'm putting on my coat --  We are late.  We are seriously late.  Which means Mister Ben we've got to get you dressed --
I made you some cocoa.  See?
&quot;In the great green room there was a telephone and a red balloon...&quot;
&quot;In the great green room there was a telephone and a red balloon...&quot;
...for Christmas, okay?  Every magician needs a white dove, a <u>real</u> one, they <u>do</u>!
Ben!  Oh my Ben!  Are you alright?
Does Rachel make a lot of money?
Rache says I have to eat <u>lamb</u>.  I told her <u>you're</u> making me <u>spaghetti</u>!
Of course, you do.  Being magic. Then you know I've got a flu bug, and I turn green and barf profusely when I even think about food.  So, all the more meatballs for you.  But you know what.
No.
Mommy's sick, guys.
Grammy had a different kind. There are lots of kinds.  Hers was very bad.
Ben.  God doesn't like visitors.
I've got a lot of medicine in me, sweetie.  And I'm a little wobbly for driving or running ar...
Right here.  Right here.  <u>Inside</u> the magician.  Shhhh.
Cooper, back the fill off I don't have enough shadow...
May I remind you that Duncan has the <u>client</u> arriving at exac...
So we'll...radiate some more?
I've got it.  It's in the can, Cooper can wrap th...
I'll call from work.  We can have a conference call.
Fine.  But I wanted to take the kids to work with me on Wednesday so I'll take Wednesday, and you can pick up that Thursday, Friday after soccer, and Saturday before riding.
At the Big Apple Circus, it's the only big top I know.  I <u>said</u> I'd get 'em back tonight...
Our children.
But he hasn't.  He wandered off.  I know it's terrifying.  I can imagine how you felt when that call came -- But it happens.
You know the kids aren't really in danger.  This is about Rachel, and you're right, I'm disappointed in her learning curve, and...
It's going to be hard for the kids when I tell them...I'd like you to be there.
You're still going to have to be dealing with me -- with us.  We should tell them together.
The great thing about life is that things keep changing.
How do you hold down a job?  It's 8:10. You were supposed to be here at 7:00. She's missed her sunrise Groom'n Ride.
Jackie, if I thought for one moment...
You bet you are.
They came out of my <u>body</u>!
She hasn't mentioned this.
She's devastated.
So.  Hopeful.
Eat your heart out.  Is Annabelle there?
It was just a job, there'll be plenty of others.
It's the same choice you made.
My advice to you?  Don't die.
You put filth in my child's mouth.
See, in that crisis, I saw an opportunity.  For some <u>real</u> growth.
You've turned her into you.  And I may not get another chance.  To turn her back.
I never wanted to be a mom.  Then, sharing it with you was one thing. Carrying it alone, the rest of my life...
Well, it's the Jack Kennedy Syndrome, huh?  You die young, you always look golden.  Perfect.  The memory kind of burnishes the image, and...
You're lying.
You are lying, you never lost that kid for 4 <u>seconds</u>, you could find him from a <u>coma</u>, there is no WAY!
Everything.  You're...the Earth Mother incarnate...
Now Edna says you short-changed your last meds.  You can do presents and be comfortable at the same time, y'know.
You'd rather spoil our walk home.
You don't need to.  I don't expect you to handle them yourself.
Why are you taking this out on <u>him</u>?
It's forever you know.
What a great surpri...
Why in the world would she t...
Can we go sit somewhere?
I told her I loved her.
No.  I'm doing it behind her back.
Don't ever say that.
You heard me: leave the table!
We're studying the Holocaust in Social Studies.
Well, I'm supposed to watch Schindler's List for homework. The movie's like almost four hours. And then I'm supposed to write a report on survivors.  You know any survivors, Dad?
Marty, ignore him.
Well, no. But he had to escape the Nazis.
Wow.  Why did your parents have so many children? I mean, if they were poor, wouldn't it be better to have just one or two?
But do you really believe in God? And heaven, hell and angels and all kind of stuff?
But like, what do you like to do when you're not working?
Consuelo. Are you crying?
Gee, I didn't even know you had any children. But why are you so upset about Jesus?
Maybe he was and you just didn't know it.
But really, you never know.
You've got a family tragedy on your hands. Will you tell me what's funny about that? About a kid in a coma?
We're not ready.
Don't even joke about that!
Marty...
We did the same thing last year also.
Well...yes. If it hadn't been for Hitler, he wouldn't have had to leave Europe. We would have been...European.
Ready for tomorrow?
I can read it to you.
Marcus...You'll write something better next time!
That's not fair! I was honest! Just because I wasn't sucking up like 	that bitch Catherine.
Which is it? You gotta keep your focus straight.
But what kind of pull did you have?
I think Scooby's like a lot of kids. He just hit a?a speed bump. Now he's gonna find his way, his path is gonna be cleared, and I think he's gonna continue his education at a good college. And everybody else is gonna be happy.
The same. Same as what?
OK.
I don't think there's any hope, either. I was just trying to make you feel better.
You're welcome.  Dad??Would you let me try hypnotizing you now?
Hey, Mikey. You wanna get some ice cream?
Come here, give me a hug!
Yeah, uh, listen. Why don't you go upstairs and keep your Mom and Brady company for a bit? I need to speak alone with Consuelo for a moment.
You're not.
Oh.  Do you think I have a potential as a writer?
I dunno...
Who is this?
Great!
So what's going on?
Anything I might know about?
That's good. So then what do you do now?
Oh? Anything I might have seen?
Uh, well, anyway, so I'm looking for subjects for this documentary on teenage life in suburbia. Kind of an exploration of the mental psyche of its mythology. I wrote to Derrida to see if he'd like to do the narration. But everything's still kind of in development at this point.
Great. How old are they?
Listen, Toby, I can't really talk right now. Do you mind if I call you back?
How'd you get it?
Is it loaded?
Scooby, don't! Be careful!
Oh. You mean, like, Blair Witch Project?
Whoopee.
Can I see what you have so far?
Twenty-five-million!  And what will they do if the money isn't delivered?
We got trouble.  That bodyguard son- of-a-bitch has them running all over the field--just took out three on the north end!
I said I'll lead.
Anything else?  Maybe a sandwich?
What's that supposed to mean?
What about rule one:  never let the person you are protecting out of your sight!
I have a lighter!
Are the labs in operation?
How's the arm?
Good.
Why the hell didn't you tell us this was at stake!
What about Cooper--where is he?
Is there anything in there that can blow?  We have to be ready for any contingency--
He wouldn't take it on the helicopters. He'd transport it through pipelines that connect Chemco to the waterfront...
Have you broken it yet?  We've got six more heads and that means six more hours.
KZ...7-0...7-0...nine.  It checks out.
Our traveler's insurance, you know what I mean?
Good.
Get your men to do it!
Where are you trying to reach him?
This dreadful accident could never have happened if your government hadn't cynically and hypocritic- ally blocked every proposal we made for disarmament or arms control!!
Do you mean to say you'd set it off in your own country?
My seven body orifices????
Major?...Major?  I'm Colonel "Bat" Guano, 701 Battalion.
What are you talking about, Major?
Do you have any witnesses, Major?
They told me, Major.  And I didn't hear anything about any atomic attack.
Ceida Pietraszkiewicz...P...I...E... T...R...A...S...Z...K...I...E...W... I...C...Z.
Go back to sleep, baby.
I didn't say anything.  What's the meaning of disturbing me at this hour, Colonel?
Just a second, sir.  He's got films of the War Room in that thing!
I didn't speak to him, sir.  But Colonel "Bat" Guano was in command of the Special Service battalion, so I would imagine he did.
No calls at all.  With or without my say-so. My voice can be imitated too, Major.
Who do you think you're talking to?
I hope not.  Now, as soon as you do what I told you, have Plan-R radioed to the Wing.
Are you questioning my orders, Major?
I see you're playing your radio, Major. Isn't that contrary to my instructions for the personnel of this base?
Certainly, Major Mandrake.  You're a good officer, and you can ask me a question any time you want to.
You know the regulations well, Major.
Well, General -- I was wondering, why are you doing this?  I mean why do you want to start the war?
Well, I think I remember reading the report on that.  Wasn't it something like a hundred and sixty million?
I suppose we might catch them off their guard.
But even then, we wouldn't get everything.  I mean some missiles would abort, or they'd miss their targets, or maybe the enemy have some secret bases we don't know about.
Well, I know they've been going on for years, and they haven't gotten any place.
Go on, Major.  You fascinate me.
General, now that you've done that, I beg you to recall the Wing.
General Schmuck, are you positive of your figures?
Yeah, to see if we're on our toes.
We should be crossing the coast in about six minutes.
You know what that'll do to our fuel consumption.
He's right.  We wouldn't have started it.
He's right.  They must have clobbered some of our cities already.
Maximum ECM.
Check.
They can't touch us at this height.
Sorry, King.  My leg's stiff as a board.
Well, listen, King.  Could you take her up to about eight hundred?  That'll help you come in at a nice down-angle, and it'll give us a chance for our chutes to open.
Okay.  Check these points.  Complete radio silence.  To ensure that the enemy can't plant false transmissions and fake orders, the CRM-114 is to be switched into all receiver circuits.  The three code letters of the period are to be set on the alphabet dials of the CRM-114, which will in turn block any transmissions other than those preceded by the code letters. You got it?
So am I.
Where'd they get you?
Are you saying our order don't make sense?
Check target approach.
Primary bomb is live.
Let's have a rundown on the damage, Lothar?
Yes, Major.
Have you tried the emergency system?
King, would you mind if I keep me hands on the wheel when you take her in?
In a matter of weeks, sufficient improvements for a dwelling space could be provided.
We are?
Did you ever hear that saying, "This too shall pass"?
Well, you shouldn't drink. Are you gonna drink?
We were all riding around and it suddenly hit me what we were doing. We were getting off on the fact that we're in a car teen feet longer than all the rest. And I got out and I just started walking.
Well, what it was... I, I don't want to admit it, but, you know, I was jealous of Pony.
That was really great.
Responsibility, progress.
Typical male.
Yup.
Your a nurse?
Any gunshot victims?
Your ability to fantasize is only exceeded by your ability to lie.
Hey, it's me. No, that's, that's the ultimate liar of liars.
Pony's coming here to the corner?!
No, I seriously doubt that Pony's gonna be in a limo.
No, no.
That sounds so great, man. Yes. Yes. Hey, what would you do in the afternoon?
I feel really bad about that, but I was busy, you know, I mean...
No, I know what you're going to say. I don't know anything about making a video. But that's a plus.
Oh, and guess who showed up.
Wait. Hey, man.
Bullshit.
Great.
They are old, we are young, they are fast, we are fun.
Hey, man.
Yeah, he's told me. Burnfield. We all hear about Burnfield.
What do you mean? His girlfriend?
Am I fucking him?
So, then, you're, like, available?
Yes! Free concert!
Oh, my God, you found it. Thank you so much.  Did you get your tape?
You better! Yes!
It's safe, come on.
You stand someplace else, man. You stand someplace else. This is our corner. You don't fucking own it!
It's okay.
So tell us, man. Party time, trashin' hotel rooms, babes around the clock?
Yeah!
I mean, do you have something I could show my manager? I mean, do you have a reel?
So you came by to see how the other half lives, huh? Well, here we are, What do you think? Pretty fucking pathetic huh? Kind of like one of those documentaries on educational TV?
So you, like, come from a town like this or...?
"It's not a job, it's an adventure." Right? I hated it. I had to get out. So I was working in the kitchen, chopping lettuce, you know, real heroic stuff, and I, uh, I had this big fucking knife and I chopped off the tip of my little finger and three days later I was a free man.
We could still talk, you know? It's nice to talk.
Oh, you were excellent tonight, Pony.
It's coming along.
Actually, the only thing I gotta give that guy is a one-way ticket back to Greaseball-land.
You don't need to sit next to me right now.
Tim, what are you talking about?
Well, it ain't no pup tent in the garage, you know what I mean? Fuck. So they'll talk and talk. They'll probably talk all night. And, oh, they'll decide that they're gonna spend the night together, right? But, you know, they're gonna keep their underwear on and they're not gonna do anything. By six a.m. he's parking the pink Cadillac. Fuck. There's really only one answer.
Anarchy, my friend. Fuck 'em. You know what I mean?
You hit her? Oh, wait, wait a minute. Why'd you hit her?
No, no. That's not the way it is at all. No, I stayed up all night trying to figure out how to protect my best friend. Wait, yeah, no, I was trying to come up with some lie so that you wouldn't have to go to jail for the rest of your life.
The sun hasn't even come up yet and you're drinking.
I don't know.
What about my feelings? What about my fucking feelings? These assholes, they come over here, they know all the answers, right? Well, they don't know shit.
Your sure as hell right about that.
I stand for honesty! I stand for some level of truth!
Um, because you didn't want to go.
It was a racial incident.
What?
No one does nothing, Jeff.
Taking one community college course on the history of Nicaragua, while barely holding a job packing boxes?
My goal is to make art.
No, I don't.
FUCK! Pony, if we wanted to hear you sing, we would've gone to your concert!
Wait, Sooze, I, I have to talk to you, 'cause I, there's something I figured out.
No, no, I have to talk to you.
Yeah.
Aw, come on. Rock star. Fame. Fortune. Sex.
Yeah.
You know, I've thought about that, actually.
So you think I should?
Yeah, they could be songs.
Great.
No, you know what? It's not you, man. It's not anybody. It's me. Whoo! Hey.
Fuck 'em. Fucking assholes.
Look Pakeesa...
Look, get down now, you fucking drunk! You bum!
Pony, oh my god!
You did? I love him. Yeah, you know, I'm thinking of moving to New York.
Yeah. To go to school and, you know, paint, performances, paint.
You do not!
Yeah?
Yeah, come on, play it.
Alright, alright already.
You know, that is my worst fear. Making a sound and no one hears it.
No, I'm going.
Soon.
What's that supposed to mean?
I hate it here. It's so ugly, it's like being dead. You got out of here, you know? I'm ready to go.
Yeah, you know, when you called I thought, there's a name from the past.
You know, my mom has this saying.
What the fuck are you talking about?!
Tim?
Well, I mean, she always answers her beeper.
Yeah? Well, what'd she say?
Okay. You know what? Watch your fucking language, alright? Or I might have to.
You know, man, it's none of your business what I do, okay?
Hey, great game Friday. Kicked Holbrook's ass, huh?
Hey, your gonna regret this.
Leave him alone, Tim.
Forget about New York, Jeff. I don't want to talk about New York anymore.
Who are you - the goddamn Bionic Woman?!
Hey!  Rule number one - never take off the mask!  Y'hear me!  No matter what happens, NEVER TAKE OFF THE MASK!
NO-GAH-BUH- NO!  Rule number two - NO NAMES!  NO GODDAMN NAMES, you retard!
Holy shit.
I'm in, too.
And you know real cops aren't half as smart as Keanu.
...He slices off the guy's ear, and I mean you see everything - the bloody pink hole where the --
C'mon, Luce, people do it in the movies all the time.
But, we have to make a smart plan!
Okay, even with all our savings, it's still only six hundred fifty-four.
-- We practice!  Sorry, Cleo.
Di, it's Luce.  Kansas just called and said she's going to "fuck me up!"  Then I heard coughing, a thud and Kansas had to go.  I think her Grandma had another heart attack.  Anyway, why does she want to "fuck me up?"
... so when your dad said, "I never want to see your "f-'in' faces again!" do you think he meant forever or just until your mom wakes up?
I see a flower.  And y'know, even the most beautiful flowers still grow from dirt.
So, while we're knee deep in right now - and things seem pretty "stinky" - in the long run, we're going to grow strong from this.
I sure do.
Like Cocoa Puffs.  Good.  Captain Crunch.  Bad.  Shreds the roof of your mouth.  I mean you hear, "Tricks are for kids!"  And you think, "I'm a kid, I guess they're for me."  But your baby brain's got no idea that Fruit Loops are, like, a million times better.  I'm going to save our kid all that pain.
If you could be Count Chocula, Frankenberry or Trix the Rabbit, who'd you be?
I never knew you dreamed of working in a grocery store bank branch.  Baby, we are living the great American Dream!
Madonna.
It was Lucy!  Lucy went to the cops!
Yeah, hold on.
Hello?
Hello?
...my Sunday School teacher says that in prison, women shove broom sticks up your...
Is that you down there?
Then I'll throw a few more treats on the plate.  Where's my smokes?
Oh please, we've all got bright futures ahead of us - we're not going to tell anyone.  Promise!
I'm only allowed "G" movies.
All of you!
They could kill you.
My best friend got pregnant.
Kansas, I want you to meet someone special.
What the hell do you want?
I hate to think where that puts me.  I could be her father.
It must be about that appalling script of hers.  What can I say to her? What can I say?
Roll 'em.
Well, what do you know ! Joe Gillis !
Sure, this'll go on all night.
Walking out on the mob.  What's the big idea?
The accent! I've got it: this guy is in the pay of a foreign government. Get those studs.  Get those cuff-links.
This is Miss Kramer.
Name dropper.
Well....
How about capturing the kitchen and barricading the door?
You won't.  I'll get us a refill of this awful stuff.
Hello, Artie.  Good evening, Miss Schaefer.
I was afraid of that.
It's not your career -- it's mine. I kind of hoped to get in on this deal.  I don't want to be a reader all my life.  I want to write.
Just so you don't think I'm a complete swine -- if there's anything in Dark Windows you can use, take it.  It's all yours.
What about all those ideas you had?
Psychopaths sell like hotcakes.
Sorry.  It's your baby now.
Look, Betty, It can't be done. It's out.
So do I.
Good.
Who's Norma?
Not at all.  It taught me a little sense.  I got me a job in the mail room, worked up to the Stenographic. Now I'm a reader...
Hey, what's the matter... Betty, wake up!  Why are you staring at me like that?
You bet.
Hers.
Did you see them? Did you see how they came?
We've missed you too, dear.
Nothing would thrill me more -- if it were possible.
I wouldn't know.
How long is a movie script these days?  I mean, how many pages?
Who else ?
Salome -- what a woman! What a part! The Princess in love with a Holy man.  She dances the Dance of the Seven Veils.  He rejects her, so she demands his head on a golden tray, kissing his cold, dead lips.
Well?
I wrote that with my heart.
I will not have it butchered.
Maybe I'd better take the rest of the script home and read it -
The name is Gillis.  I'm single.
There sure is.
That's a dreadful shirt you're wearing.
Of course you do.  A tuxedo and tails.
Now, I'm not going to wear ear- rings, I can tell you that.
Not on the same floor with Valentino!
It's a quarter past ten.  What time are they supposed to get here?
You think this is all very funny.
What are the notes?
What right? Do you want me to tell you?
Who? Some car hop, or a dress extra?
I hope you realize, Norma, that scripts don't sell on astrologers' charts.
Have one of mine.
Pull up at the drugstore, will you, Max.  I'll get you some.
I can still see myself in the line: Bebe Daniels, Marie Prevost, Mabel Normand ... Mabel was always stepping on my feet ...What's the matter with you, darling?  Why are you so glum?
How do you like that? We've made twelve pictures together. His greatest successes.
Don't you want to come along, darling?
I just came to say good night. I don't want you to see me -- I'm not very attractive.
I was a little worried about the line of my throat.  This woman has done wonders with it.
I just happen to know it.  I had a nightmare and I screamed for you.  You weren't here.  Where were you?
Norma, you'd be throwing it away. I don't qualify for the job, not any more.
That's a lie!  They still want me!
I'm the greatest star of them all.
This room has not been used for a long time.
I'm talking to you.  My clothes and things are up in the room.
Hey, what's this with the door? There isn't any lock.
How about my going up the kitchen stairs and undressing in the dark. Will that do it?
So they tell the kid to throw the World Series, or else, huh?
Of course, we're always looking for a Betty Hutton.  Do you see it as a Betty Hutton?
There's nothing, Gillis.  Not even if you were a relative.
So you need three hundred dollars? Of course, I could give you three hundred dollars.  Only I'm not going to.
Wait a minute.  I want you to get out the car.  You're going to take the script over to Paramount and deliver it to Mr. De Mille in person.
I'm an artist, Alura. My work comes first. Other people come second.
I said stop, I didn't say run into a brick wall.
What does it mean?
Oh, fiddlesticks. What could be dangerous about a baseball game?
When can I see, you again ?
I used to work here summers when I was a kid.
You're not afraid are you?
Is this how?
Great! I'II build a house-- right over there, with a veranda looking out to sea. And I'll plant a garden! Papayas, pineapples, bananas, mangoes--- anything'll grow here. And I'II fish in the lagoon, and we can go sailing in a dugout canoe, and---
Hey, listen, when all this blows over, maybe we could get together every now and then and see each other. And maybe something might. happen again. What do you think?
That's the Power Source that was lost from Argo City! That's what I came: to find! Where does she live?
Before you go...
You've had your fun, Selena, the game is over.
Hey! Ethan!
I bet they do.
What is it?
To us. And to the seeds we'll plant together.
Oh no, not you again.
Why should I believe you?
Yes, yes I saw the whole thing. How could you be interested in that puny little girl?
Nurse! Nurse!
Nurse!
This is your problem, right here. This girl's driving you insane, Ethan. Let me help you.
You're a regular Einstein, aren't you?
Can I give you a lift?
Why didn't you tell me?
It was my fault we lost the Power Source.
Superman will return it.
You see, a tree is a living thing.
I can do that.
I have money to buy more, but I haven't had a chance since...
Your hair looks the same.
No thanks. You go on.
What can I do for you?
No plans for the weekend, Linda?
Cheer up, Nigel. It's not the end of the world.
Nigel, get lost.
Which of you is willing to make that sacrifice?
That ought to keep you out of my hair for a while.
Where is inner space?
They'll be grateful. If you hadn't found it, it would still be lost. Look, up ahead.
...mid pleasures and palaces though I may roam..."
It's lovely. . .
You look at them? How?
Yes, mustn't stop.
Goodbye...
Brad is not a good name for a cocktail.
Man, you don't never pass out, do ya?
And three years after the Royal Wedding, the King abdicated.  Isn't that terrible?
That's easy to say. But how? And what about Ricky?
That song. I remember one day I came into the music room and you were fooling around at the piano. And I thought -- what am I going to do with all this potato salad?
Well, it's true you have to be careful things don't spoil, especially with mayonnaise or cream.
And even nicer when there's a man around, Which isn't all that often.
Gee, I haven't laughed like that since -- since --  I really can't remember when.
That's the biggest change in Smallville, you know. They've taken over this town. Everybody who isn't actually working for Wheat King -- like I do -- is out there --  on a Wheat King thresher.  Do you think I could do it? Do you?
Gee, I always loved porch swings.
No, well in this case I think I can speak for him.  I mean, I'm pretty close to him, you know.  Superman will be there on Wednesday.
Do you really know Superman?
Mr. Kent, could I ask you something?
Name?
Mr. Gorman, according to our records you have been unemployed for 36 weeks.
Not counting this week.  You secured employment last June as a messenger and were discharged after one day for. . .
A television set?
You are, I was about to say, no longer eligible.
Workin' overtime? What are you doin', buddy, looking for a raise?
You've been a naughty boy haven't you?  C'mon now, admit it, you were kinda naughty.
Now me, I was born rich. I've never worn the same pair of socks twice.
I believe they're laundered and sent to some charitable institution. I don't know what the heck they do with 'em. Maybe they use them for dust rags, or pen wipers...
Under different company names. I control the price of coffee beans in Brazil. The price in Venezuela. Java, South Korea, North Korea, the Aleutian Islands, Guam, Bolivia, and the Republic of Gabon!
But y'see, chum, the problem I got is that one country just won't play ball with me.  You know how that can just bug a guy, don't you?
How do you do that?
It ain't. It's nowhere. It blew up. That's how come they shipped the dude to Earth when he was a baby.  well. I know some stuff too, y'all.
Every oil tanker and super- tanker and super-duper-tanker in the ocean is controlled. totally, by computers. Computers to tell them where to go, how much oil to take on, where to deliver it.
Now...when do I get a taste?
Is this whitemail?
A computer.
I invented it, man. In my head. It's a stone killer-diller get-down get-it-on and twice-on-Sunday super mutha computer.
Yeah? How's it look?
Can you do that?
Who is she?
Who's the other woman?
He was asleep before his head hit the pillow.  Well, this was only the biggest day of his life. I really don't know how to thank you.
It's hard to believe... a great looking girl like you all alone like this. As she glances up at him, she is first flustered, then flattered, then...finally...just realistic:
The picture looks blurry.
Never.  I get air-sick. You wouldn't like that.
How would you know?
Come on, will you?  We've got to get ready before he gets here.
You! Activate circuits 29 through W7 and start Full Power Coordinates on Exterior Defensive Systems:
53.
Now, Vera...uh, Simpson, you know my Staff Dietician?
Well, chum? What now? Kiss the 85 thou goodbye? Pay some thief's salary while he thinks up new ways to shake the money tree?
It could make weather!
You mean...you mean...Vera! Vera! The magnitude of this!!!
Nice try, Butch,  but it wouldn't be effective against Superman.  You'll see! Now that he's pulled this stunt, he'll stick his nose in my oil scheme and ruin that one, too! I've got to get rid of him! I've got to!
I just remembered the rest. There isn't any more. The only chunk that ever landed on Earth disappeared a couple of years ago. It was in this story in the Daily Planet.
Yes! This time we got it right!
Anybody been hurt?
Lois, I usually do.
Uh. . .
One thousand?? That's an awful lot of oranges. You know there are pill, Lois. I've seen them.
I do?
'Magic Fingers.' Fifty cents.
Yeah, thanks. . . . I mean, really! Posing as newlyweds to uncover the honeymoon racket in Niagara Falls.  I mean,. imagine wasting a great reporter -  -- uh, reporters -- on this.  Perry White and his Sunday Magazine exposes.
I was right. you are Superman.
Maybe we ought to hire a bodyguard from now on.
You do?
Does Lois know about this yet?
What??
Gee. But --
Lex...Lex, how could you do that to Otis?
You'll have to pack quickly.
Artemis? Do you read me?
And she -- the one you have chosen -- she feels as much for you?
-- as the keeper of the archives of Krypton, it falls to me to tell you of the darkest episode in our planets history.
For many eons the peoples of our world have lived together in harmony. Then there appeared among us three anti-social elements - what on Earth are classified as "criminals."
Where?
Wait, wait, wait just a moment. Wait till you've got to know better will you please.  Wait, -- look, I can give you anything you want. I can give you the brass ring, the - er -- unlimited freedom to maim, cure, destroy, chew - plus Lex Luthor's savvy. Lex Luthor's career guidance... Lex Luthor's School of...
Oh my Fullness, as I explained to you before, I am about the best there is. Second best there is.
He flies as well, then . . .
Superman! The --
You must be freezing.
I knew you'd double-cross me, Luthor. A lying weasel like you couldn't resist the chance . . .
Why do you say this to me when you know I will kill you for it?
No drinks . No movie. This is the last time I take a charter flight.
Who is this . . . Superman?
Yes, but will you honor it?
He...  cares. He actually cares about these . . . . . .these People. These earth People .
They make my eyes itch.
Don't tell me. You learned to dance at church socials.
Oh . . . no, there's no one back home.
Hello, Lacy. Can anybody break a twenty? The cabbie didn't have any change.
I missed you. It wasn't any fun up there with just Lois and Superman. They're so boring. Let's go do something wild!
Daddy's offered me jobs at some of his other companies. But, I've been thinking maybe I'll take some time off.  I'm going to find a place like Smallville, in the country. Maybe a  farm . . .  see what the slow lane is like.
You don't have to be polite, Clark. I've got a pretty good idea of how you feel about me.
No Paris?
Superman? Has something happened to him?
Well . . . I see the ocean currents. . . and the rain . . . and mountains and rivers. . . but . . .
But you can't tell where one country begins and another ends. You can't see any borders. It's just . . . one world.
Yes, darling?
Tone down our headlines? Lacy, that's all the common man reads!
No, Daddy. Our business is journalism. We can't continue to be so irresponsible . . . or else we'll just lead everyone into a disaster.
Gee, Uncle Lex, I don't think this guy's much of a dancer.
Hey! He looks . . . normal.
Guess who? It's your old friend, Lex.
Your time in prison has twisted you into a delusionary state, Luthor.
Ahhhh, my favorite part of the day. Who else could have thought of this aquarium?
It's very simple, Otis.  Very simple, the XK101 rocket. It's nothing, forty years ago we in the Fatherland were working on this. Five more years, we would've had it. But then  --  --  that silly war...Why, my cousin Werner had already  --
Do you know where you're headed?
Keep warm now.
I'll bet you have some good ideas.
Some people aren't the athletic type.
See? Didn't I tell you this was a tough town?
Hey!
It isn't worth getting a heart attack over, Lois.
He grabbed me! He held me! He set me down gently! How could that be done with mirrors?
You're just jealous.
Super...man. Hmmm...
The bald man! The one who tried to kill me?
Couldn't we forget the plane? You could lift me in your big strong arms?
It isn't a Park Avenue address. really.
Your father was a sick weirdo.
This??
Streets, Sunlight. When was the last time I saw sunlight.
Speaking of feeding things, what about dinner?
Again???
I needed this, Y'know? I really needed this. just when I'm nearing the fruition of my project, Big Bird flies into town.  Go ahead! Kill me by inches! Put me on the agony rack!
Some people can read 'War and Peace' and come away thinking it was a simple adventure story. Other people can read the ingredients on a chewing gum wrapper and come away with the secret of the universe.  Y'know.
No news is not good news. Y'know
I don't understand.
Danger??  Somebody??? Lex  -- where are you going?
I was thinkin' what to call him. I was thinkin' I had an uncle who was a fine man, you recall him? The Church Sexton
Got all A's this year. Teacher said he's the best 5th grader in the -
Lara, please...
Their atmosphere will sustain him. He will look like one of them.
Yes, true. But on other worlds there would be other problems - heat, cold, no life, no life support systems...No, Lara, believe me; Earth is the least of evils. On Earth, his lighter gravity will render him almost weightless - that can't be helped. But with his denser molecular structure, he will also be strong.  He will be fast, He will be virtually invulnerable.
Or twenty-four as it is in Earth time. Furthermore, if you will reveal yourself, your enemies will have a way of getting at you where you are vulnerable: by hurting the people you care for.  Ah, this Earth...this world you live in, Kal-El...  Resist its temptations, its rewards, especially its political system.
Do as I say. Let go!
With my luck, now it'll rain.
Superman???
I didn't mean that in any pejorative way.
How much do you weigh?
What about this X-Ray vision of yours?
Can you really see through anything?
Do bullets really bounce off you?
There.
And now he lies to me. He has been stealing ladies' purses again.  Haven't you? Haven't you, you miserable petty crook?
Cleaning a rock, Otis?  Jot it down. As soon as we're back, he feeds the pets.
Well, that's their problem, T.S. But  --  but the XK 101 also works on a radio wave control system. The problem was to find out the frequency. Problems, problems, I've had so many...
Now who's the dreamer, Superman? Even you can't fly that fast!
Yes, we do know each other.  I'm Alison Jones.
And what does he do again?
We're...not together.
I'm glad to hear that Zoe's okay.
I don't remember the name.  It was near a beach.
I...don't think so.
I hope she gets better.
Mr. Mitchell Stephens, Esquire, would you be likely to sue me if I was to beat you right now?  Beat you so bad that you pissed blood and couldn't walk for a month.  Because that's what I'm about to do.
That's my daughter.  Or it may be the police to tell me that they've found her dead.  She's a drug addict.
It just seems...kind of weird.
What do you mean 'outgrown it'?
So what brings you out tonight?
I don't see how that concerns you, Billy.
Well, I don't know why it should. There's a whole lot of people in town involved with lawsuits.  We're hardly unique here, Billy.  I mean, I can understand how you feel.
No, Billy.  We can't drop the lawsuit.  You know how much we need the money.
It's not enough.  For hospital bills.  For Nicole.
They can look forward to that.
...or that the guardrail wasn't strong enough.
Is it true that you gave Nicole one of Lydia's dresses?  That she was wearing it when the bus crashed?
Why did you do that, Billy?
Dolores.  No one calls me 'Mrs. Driscoll'.
Those are all from the fair last year.  Abbott and me were judges at the pet show.
That's the way I thought of them sometimes.
Abbott and I used to do a lot of that in the spring.
I told you that I was doing fifty miles an hour when the accident happened.  That's how I remembered it.  But the truth is, I might have been doing sixty.  Or sixty five. And if that's true, that I was over the limit when the bus went over, what would happen then?
Anything you didn't understand?
Away from your crazy Mom.
And winter?
That was Billy Ansel on the phone. He wants to come over to talk to us.
No.
Can I sit beside you on the bus tomorrow?
That's right.
Should I keep reading?
It would be strange if you didn't feel that way.
There's no such thing as an accident, Nicole.  Not in a situation like this.
I object to the form of that question.  Note that.
Note that she said 'pretty clearly'. Not 'clearly'.
That's the local bar?
What do you mean?
That's great, Wendell.  That's the sort of thing I need to know.  So it doesn't come back to haunt our case later on.
Tell me about the Ottos.
Yes.
I'm in a car wash.
News?
Yes.  Give me your news, Zoe.
What do you want me to do, Zoe? I'll do whatever you want.
I'm sorry about that, Mr. Stephens. Would you like to try the fish?
You think someone else caused the accident?
So you're just the thing we need.
What time in the morning was this?
I was scared.
Why were you scared?
How fast would you say Mrs. Driscoll was going?  To the best of your recollection?
You saw the speedometer?
Did you say anything to Mrs. Driscoll?
There wasn't time?
That was great.
What's so funny?
What took so long?
What's that?
They say I'm lucky because I can't remember the accident.
How do you like it, Nicole?
Pretty slick, eh?
That's too high.  I'll never reach it.
Yes.
She'll move away.
Don't even think of the Bilodeaus or the Atwaters.  They're all inbred.
Will you mind your own business!
Joe, give my nephew a drink.
That's a lollipop that, boy.  The kid is only great.
You told him that?
That's a nice tour.  All booked?  When was Susie around here last?
You don't know that lunatic yet? Whims - egotistic whims!  Like the gag - when you got him for a friend, you don't need an enemy!  That's what the fight with Bartha was about. "Leo", I says, "Hunsecker froze me out.  So I'm eating humble pie this month - please print me an item."
I hate J.J. -- but not that much at this moment...
Blessings on thee, the both...well... Gotta run now.  See you two kids later!
Sidney is a liar!
And I believe that's precisely where I read it, too.  You see, J.J., where I get my reputation for being the best-informed man in Washington.
Say hello to Sidney Falco.  Tickle him - he's been a bad boy tonight. He called you my fat friend.
Say, that's good - it's nice - in fact, it's APT, Harry!
I'm a schoolboy - teach me, teach me.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think so...
I know Steve.  No.
He means that much to you...?
I'm not sure I can reach him in time.
Well he's got her in a tizzy, I'll tell you that!
Full of beans, ain't you?  But you know that you'll stand or fall by what you're doing now...
Why do something that would drive them right back into each other's arms?  Not to mention that this time Susie would know who shot the arrow...
J.J., it's one thing to wear your dog collar...but when it gets to be a noose...I'd rather have my freedom.
Sidney, I told you -
Listen with care - this will cost me everything, so you know I'm telling you the truth!
I don't think so.
Is Frank D'Angelo around?
And where was his wife?
We're old friends, Chickie - quit it!  A big columnist comes in this room, without his ball-and-chain and you make like a delicatessen counter!  What did you think would happen in his house?
Do you think you could do something, Sidney?
Don't you think I have any feelings? What am I?  A bowl of fruit?  A tangerine that peels in a minute?
A girl needs a little romancing before she -
That's the third time he's called today.
That makes five days in a row that Mr. Hunsecker's cut you out of his column.
I put a lotta trust in you, Chickie...
I swear, Sidney, I can't help it - sometimes I wonder what I see in you...
Where's those glossy prints you promised?  Tonight's the latest I can place them -
It's a habit with me.  So now I'm briefed.  So what?
Give him credit---the boy's gall is gorgeous!
Where do you come off to make a remark like that?
I hope that J.J. really likes Steve, that it isn't an act.
Susie, whatever problems you have with J.J. - I didn't invent them! What're you blaming me for?  If you learned to let out your hatred you would be better off!
I know that bit - you're a girl; you need a man to give you strength! So what do you pick such weak sisters for?  Don't you know yet that you fight fire with fire, not with tear drops?
You haven't told him yet...
I have a message for you; I love you.  May I dedicate the next number to you?...And the next, and the next. Every Sunday I'll buy you a new bonnet -
Steve, I feel exhausted...what do you want me to do?
... but the output went to shit after three seconds.  I'm thinking now it's the way I'm matrixing the command hierarchies...
Do you know about the chip?
We should abort.
Do you have bandages?
Holy shit... you're really real!  I mean... whoah!  You're, uh... like a machine underneath, right... but sort of alive outside?
Radical.
Where we going?
You sure?
You have to do what I say?!
Listen to me, very carefully, okay?  You're not a terminator any more.  Alright?  You got that? You can't just go around killing people!
Now remember, you're not gonna kill anyone, right?
That's great!  See, you're getting it.
We're not gonna make it, are we?  People, I mean.
Excellent.
"No fate."  No fate but what we make.  My father told her this... I mean I made him memorize it, up in the future, as a message to her -- Never mind.  Okay, the whole thing goes "The future is not set.  There is no fate but what we make for ourselves."
Killing Dyson might actually prevent the war.
We don't have much time.
Is it dead?
They took him from me.
I know, but I'm not as strong as I'm supposed to be.  I can't do it.  I'm screwing up the mission.
Kyle, don't go!
I'll bet. Makes you a more efficient killer, right?
My CPU is a neural-net processor... a learning computer.  But Skynet presets the switch to "read-only" when we are sent out alone.
In a few months he creates a revolutionary type of mircoprocessor.
In three years Cyberdyne will become the largest supplier of military computer systems.  All stealth bombers are upgraded with Cyberdyne computers, becoming fully unmanned,  Afterward, the fly with a perfect operational record.
I must be destroyed.
Are you afraid?
Where do you stand on all this?
That's because you had a proper upbringing.
What does he mean, too correct?
I guess so, sir.
Where you from, David?
So what is it?
Jeez. And you think the British'll share it with their Allies?
You see, Wilhelm, I'm talking about ordinary, everyday reasons. Which is why I want to discuss your private life.  How many illegitimate children do you have?
A great artist will have great privileges in a Russian zone.
You live here, in Berlin?
You do shorthand and typing?
Major, Major... he's here ...
But he had no idea, a lot of people had no idea. I only realised what was really going on when I got arrested.
What they do in Austria doesn't interest me one little bit. Okay? I have your questionnaire here,  Gustav Heinrich Ernst Martin Wilhelm Furtw?ngler, born Berlin, January 1886. Orchestral conductor. And you say here you were never a member of the Nazi Party.
How come?
Or maybe you called Goebbels or Goering? You were so close you were in the same shithouse as them.
Why were they going to arrest you?
You sure knew a lot of people in high places.
I have a list of names here, people in your profession, who got out in '33. Bruno Walter, Otto Klemperer, Arnold Schoenberg, Max Reinhardt...
I've got to hand it to the British, David. You know what those guys are?  Decent.  Tell me, Herr Dr. Furtw?ngler, do you know Hans Hinkel?
Yup, that's him, that's the guy. You know what else the little creep did? He kept files, close on 250,000 files. And you know what's in those files?
What did Goering say?
Maintain liberty, humanity and justice.
No, because I had only one intention. My only intention whatever I did was to show that music means more than politics.
Von der Null?
That's an outrageous lie!
Well. Once he said he'd read what this man wrote about me.
He said, 'Don't mind him. His job is to criticise, your job is to conduct.'
Helmuth Alfred Rode. Second violinist since 1935. What's it mean, second violinist?
Major.
Yes, you remember.
Show me.
Was a member of...?  Speak up?
Oh, I see, he made you co-operate. And now are you a communist again?
One of your people told me.
Goebbels, yes, Josef Goebbels said, 'There's not a single filthy Jew left in Germany on whose behalf Dr. Furtw?ngler has not intervened.' No, no one could have been less of a Nazi than Dr. Furtw?ngler.
You ever seen Adolf Hitler's eyes when he was making a speech? I've seen 'em on films.
Was looking at Furtw?ngler like that?
He's as big as Toscanini, maybe even bigger. In this neck of the woods, he's probably Bob Hope and Betty Grable rolled into one.
Dr. Furtw?ngler is a great musician. He actively opposed the Nazis and later on he helped many Jews to escape.
Aren't I worth waiting for?
The Uzi 9 millimeter.
I had him hooked.  He was just about to ask me out. I could tell.
What do you think?
That bum.  So what if he has a Porsche, he can't treat you like that...it's Friday night for crissakes.
But outside, it's living human tissue.  Flesh, skin, hair...blood.  Grown for the cyborgs.
So, it's from the future, is that right?
You cold?
Reese...you got a first name?
This is gonna make me puke. Talk about something.
You volunteered?
Is this enough?
Make sure there's none on the threads, like this.  Now screw the end-cap on...very gently.
Hot dogs?
Don't say that.
I bet you're ticklish.
What are you doing?
You go naked.  Something about the field generated by a living organism.  Nothing dead will go.
I didn't build the fucking thing.
Give me the short version.
That stuff's two hours cold.
Did you reach the next girl yet?
Send a unit.
Go!  Go!  He's got her.
Clean out your locker.
I'm so sorry.
Don't help me, just get more napkins. And soda water.
What's with him?
Oh, God... !
Alright... okay...
You've got to be kidding.
The lights went out, one hundred people all ran away...
Where'd you all go?  Motherfucking frat boys.  You better hide.  Is your life so pathetic that this is something you're willing to pay for?
Read what it says: "Warning, do <u>not</u> attempt to open.  If elevator stops, use emergency... "
"... wait for help."  Wait for help. I'm not opening a door that specifically warns me not to.
Please...
This is C.R.S.
We hang down here and drop.  The garbage'll break our fall.
Nice.
Where'd you get this?
Want anything to drink?
Why else would they be willing to put you under... ?
My name's not Christine.  It's not my real...
It's just money.  You should be glad you're alive.
How deluded can you be?  There's no <u>why</u>...
It could have been any asshole with a couple hundred million in the bank.
What the fuck are you... ?
Listen very carefully, I'm telling the truth... this is the game.  This was all the game.
Okay... okay...  I put it down.  Now open that door. Mister Fisher's right on the other side of that door.  He's an actor...
There's another gig starting in Saudi Arabia.  I'm just a walk-on this time though.  Bit-part.
Julliard, yeah.
Yes.
You look good.
Will you?
I thought you'd like this.  Best thing I ever did.  If you don't want to do it, DON'T...
What are you doing?
Yeah, almost...
How do you mean, exactly?
What have they been doing to you?
We'll help with the police, if you want to bother.  As far as money goes... can I make a suggestion?  You say you were mugged?
How much is it?  A few thousand, at least.  A Rolex like that... lucky for you they missed it.
I need your car, Elizabeth.
The last few days, um... I've been thinking... had a lot of spare time.  I want to tell you... I'm starting to understand why you left me.  I've been resenting you for it, maybe, but ... I want to apologize, for all of it.  For shutting you out, for not being there.  I...  Anyway, I hope you can forgive me.
It's just a t.v.  He's just an actor.
We have to head out... just wanted to say goodbye.
Oh... it's a game.
How long will these take?
Physical?
One guarantee.  Payment's entirely at your brother's discretion and, as a gift, dependent on your satisfaction.
Tell them the cops are after you... tell them you've got to talk to someone, I'm threatening to blow the whistle.
Drive in.
Where'd you pick up your checks?
Hm?
Didn't I give you two?
Thank you.
All the time I've known you, you've never once asked about him.
Goodnight.  See you home.
Pleasure to meet you, I'd like to see my brother, thank you.
Invitations: the Museum Gala.
I'll send your regrets.  Honestly, why must I even bother?
I don't like her.
What the fuck... ?!
Hey... !
Attractive...
What's happened...
How concerned should I be?
Christ... I can't believe it... invisible ink?
Very well.  If you tell me not to worry, I shan't.
And what kind of sleeper?
The children.  The children Hugh Crain built the house for.  The children he never had.
Couldn't get the last ones.  You?
Because... well, I know I can trust you.
Are you working with her?
All the carvings.
What is that tune?
Nell... please, Nell... take a deep breath...
I hadn't done a study of how group fear affects individual performance.  Mass hysteria is like a story, Nell.  A communal story.  Someone starts it.  Then we all add a little more to it. And then for some reason -- no one knows how -- we start believing it.  This story shapes what we see and hear.  We interpret everything through it, make it fit the story. I started our story when I gave you the history of Hill House. You've added to it.  That's what this experiment has all been about.  That's what it was about, the experiment's over.  I'm pulling the plug.  This is my fault.
No.
Come on.
You hear the vibrations in the wire.  There's a magnetic pulse in the wires, you feel it.  I could test it.
What's this?  What's this... this picture?
This is where we're going?
When do we take the tests?
She needs help.
Me?  No.  What are you doing here?
Why do you need a chain like that?
They're so beautiful.  Aren't they?
That'd be seventy in New York. You stole it!
Good night, Theo.
Yes.  I feel realy rested, too. Theo?
Is it over?
Well, it wasn't me.  Mister Dudley had to clean it and he knows that he's in charge of all the messes so why would he make more work for himself and...  You said the Good Doctor was with you.
I'm sorry I was mad at you, Theo.
I'll take that as a compliment.  In the city, what kind of place do you live in?
Are you sure?
Nell, what happened?
What'd you come back for, babe?
Oh, Theo.  You know I don't have an apartment.
It's not a compliment.
I don't like do-it-yourself cuisine. Buffets.  Salad bars.
Not who, food.  Should we get Italian.
I've lived in L.A. all my life, I've never done this drive.
Our black friends?
You think I'm staying?
You came to the right place, sir.  My wife's second cousin is English.  Well, Scotch-Irish.  Can I interest you in a holster?
I mean, what has it been -- six months?
What, tryin' to catch him with another bird?
Bad place, man.  Bad people.  Some guys loading some trucks.  Some kinda deal goin' down.  I don't know and I don't care.  Maybe they're shipping fava beans to Eskimos.
You hadda show up on a weekend.  This weekend.  Wouldn't've even been a gun show ... for another month.
Now what.  You gonna take your new arsenal, go visit Terry Valentine, just like that?  Boom bam boom.
Useless gits.  I was gonna do the Post Office once.
I thought maybe you just came for the ride.
Had a feeling it was you.
Why did you come here?
Sort a few things out.
And not with all that buried loot you had waiting for you when you got out.  From the Wembley Staduim job, wasn't it?  Pink Floyd concert receipts.  Jenny would've been ... fourteen at the time?
Oh, it just ended, then.
When you've lost as many years as I have, love, puts things in perspective, know what I mean.
When did you get in?
You haven't been lurking outside my building all day.
Do you even know who Terry Valentine is?
Lives high off the hog and waits for the next big thing.  Like me -- but on a grander scale of failure.
-- Your employer?
What line is he in.
I see.
So what's the deal.  You and Terry Valentine at twenty paces.  Is that what this is about.
How did you come to have my address? Found it, did you.  Among her things.
You don't seem bothered.
What did you do?  To make them take the early 70's away from you.
You mean if they'd nabbed you before you actually broke and entered you would only have been charged with making a mess.
From pursuing your chosen profession.
I was inside once.  I punched a cop at a demo.
You <u>have</u> been away.  Or is all this just new to you?
I don't believe it.
I guess you're just habitual.
Won't he be looking for you about now?
Minor officials bother you, don't they?
Fancy it?
So what's your beef, pal?
It was you.  Downtown.
Of the deal, man.
You sure?
Turned that place completely around.  180 degrees.
Yeah.  I really admire the guy.  Well. Good to meet you.
I had to, didn't I.  Nothing else for it. Then just when I'd finished my nine years -- my contract -- wallop, I had to bugger off to the States.
Hey.
I dunno.  I just said she's nice lookin'.
How'd you get in here.
Surely you can think of somewhere else to take one of your chippies for a quick getaway.
Go to him.  Go to his studio, or writers workshop or artists colony, Esselin retreat, nudist camp --
Pleasure.
...Yes?
Oh, in there? I messed up a little bit in the scherzo. I guess, if nobody noticed, it's OK. Mr Crane, this is Tony, a friend of mine. Tony, Mr Crane.
...or maybe I just haven't played 'em right, I don't know. But you're--
Sure... Sure, it's his house.
Anyway, uh... my point is you're young. A kid really, your whole life ahead of you. But it's not too soon to start thinking... to start making opportunities for yourself. Before it all washes away.
...I stank, didn't I?
...I wanted to make you happy.
...You are ze fahzer?
...she can go up there.
...Ed Crane. Remember? Today?
No problem!
...Usually we do this kind of thing with a bank draft. But cash--that's fine--it's all the same in the end-- dough's dough, huh?
Pretty straightforward, but I don't know if you wanna show this stuff to a lawyer--
...Were you in the service, Ed?
...That's quite a wife you got there.
That's my capitalization on the Annex! *My* operation, Ed! Christ almighty. That's what I was just talking to Doris about, a way of getting the money from the store that we could hide from Ann.
Where you going?
...Money problems. He's thinking about canceling the Annex.
Life is so goddamn wonderful, you almost won't believe it.
Should I... should I tell you why?
Look, I don't wanna waste your time so I'll eat while we talk. Ya mind? *You* don't mind. So while I'm in town I'll be staying at the Hotel Metropole, the Turandot Suite. Yeah, it's goofy, the suites're named after operas; room's OK though, I poked around. I'm having 'em hold it for me on account of I'll be back and forth. In addition to my retainer, you're paying hotel, living expenses, secretarial, private eye if we need to make inquiries, headshrinker should we go that way. We'll talk about appeals if, as and when. For right now, has she confessed?
OK, how did you know?
...I don't get it.
...how I was too ordinary to be the criminal mastermind the D.A. made me out to be, how there was some greater scheme at work that the state had yet to unravel, and he threw in some of the old truth stuff he hadn't had a chance to trot out for Doris...
Thanks. Thanks for seeing me, at home.
I'm fine.
'Scuse me, just finished dinner. Um. Frankly, Doris'd be better off with the county defender.
Bert's OK, sure, he's a good man. I won't kid you though, Ed, nobody around here has any experience with this kind of, er... And I hear they're bringing a prosecutor up from Sacramento. Capital offense. Taking it seriously... Hmm...
Coffee, Ed?
...So, uh, who should I--
Birdy's in the parlor--I'm on long distance here.
...Did you make that up?
That was quite something.
Jesus...
...I'm gonna take his hair and throw it out in the dirt.
I don't care what it costs! This is when ya come together!
Just people. They gotta put up the big front so that people will trust them with their money. This is why the big lobby, Ed. But they put their pants on one leg at a time. Just like you and me.
Second chair.
No, he's family, he's my brother-in- law.
As soon as the doctor lets us, we gotta move you. Does he understand that? We're supposed to tell him. Are you conscious?
What'd he say? Does he understand?
There are a couple of kids who were lost yesterday near the site of the murder.  Claimed they saw a monster. They're pretty determined to tell you their story.  You want to see them?
There's some kind of animal loose in the museum.  Pendergast's alone.  He needs help.  I want volunteers to go with me.
Don't know if it'll do any good, Mr. Cuthbert.
I'll go down and speak to him.
Sweet Jesus!
Behind you.
I made it outside.  I'll co-ordinate the rescue efforts from here.  Help is on the way.  Just sit tight.
Vince D'Agosta.  Am I out?
We need light in here, stat.
An original Roger Tory Peterson of a Red-Breasted Merganser.  Amazing.  I have a copy of this in my office at home.
Not at all.  I enjoy the smell of a good cigar.
If you don't mind, this could be important.
I've got to admit, that was a damn sight better than "the dog ate my homework".
I smell it.  It's here.
Dr. Green has to see you!
What happened?!
Come on, Margo.  We're on the verge of something huge.  Let's consider the possibility, just the three of us, alone in this room.  What if John was right.  I mean, what if?  And he sent back an egg of his monster in the crates.  When it got to the museum, it hatched.
Look at this.  An ambyloid reovirus protein.  That explains why the computer's confused.  The plant's infected with a virus.
With the intelligence of a human being, the speed of a greyhound, and the strength of a grizzly bear.
How many storage areas are there?
What's that?
Nothing.  I'm in third grade.  What's a revolutionary what ch'a ma' callit?
Not that big.
Argo!  Hobbes!
That's impossible.
For once I'm glad you're rumor central.  What in the world is going on?
Mbwun.
These plant fibers are loaded with hormones!
This is it.  This is what he, or it... is after!  The plant has high concentrations of the same hormones found in minute quantities in the human brain!
Got to finish this thesis sometime.
Somehow, when all this happened... I knew it would come back to John.  Is he really dead?
If he were alive he'd have contacted me.
John couldn't have anything to do with a horrible thing like that.  He was a fine man despite his problems --
I don't know.  He sent back a statue that's supposed to be an exact representation.  But I've never seen it.  It's in the exhibit.
Genetic damage?
Pendergast?  Are you all right?
You're not.  Where is it?
Is there another way around?
What happened?
Help someone!
I don't believe it.
Where exactly?
<i>Where</i> in Fiji?  What island?
Viti Levu.  For how many?
I do have a fabulous rate on a cruise ship departing for Fiji tomorrow.  But you wouldn't want to do that.
I thought you were in a hurry.
You want to book the flight?
Why is he in the basement?
We've declared a curfew.  Everyone else is at first positions.
Cue music...
Welcome.
How <i>do</i> you intend to explain his twenty- two year absence?
Not only does he give us a glimpse of the truth, he gives us a glimpse of ourselves.
Yes, everything you see on the show is for sale - from the actors' wardrobe, food products, to the very homes they live in--
There's nothing on the show I don't use myself.
Why do you feel that Truman's never come close to discovering the true nature of his world?
You've never actually met Truman, yourself.  Never thought about doing a cameo--playing a veterinarian, or a priest, something like that?
Why not?
I'm Truman, Truman Burbank--
No.
I'm thinking of getting out, Marlon.
I figured, what's the point?  I knew I'd just be taking my problems with me.  Once the kids came along, it made me look at Seahaven with new eyes.  I realized, what the hell could be better than this?  I'm telling you.  What you really need is someone to carry on the "Burbank" name.
I'm onto something, Marlon - something big.
There's no point in trying to explain it, but a lot of strange things have been happening - elevators that don't go anywhere, people talking about me on the radio, you know what I mean?
What exactly?
That's the "Big Guy".  Quite a paintbrush he's got.
Hi, honey.  Look at this.  It's a "Chef's-Mate."  Dicer, slicer and peeler in one.  Never needs sharpening. Dishwasher safe.
I was hoping we could have a special evening.
This'll pass.  Everybody thinks like this now and then.  Come to bed.
Where shall we go?  Where shall we go? Spontaneity is what it's all about. Forget Fiji.  We can't very well drive to Fiji, can we?  What about Atlantic City?
Truman, what about that sign?
Stop this now.  I'll do it.  I swear.
No.  You said, "Do something."  Who were you talking to?  Tell me!
You know surprises aren't good for me. You should really call before you come over, dear.
About time they started cleaning up the trash Downtown.  We don't want to end up like the rest of the country.
It looks so small.
Sure.  Okay.  Fine.  Can you pass on a message?
You got it.
Poopy day?
And you have conclusive evidence of this? Something to tie this claim of yours to the crime --
Feds are looking for him, too.  Real nice business he's got, huh?
You want a call if we turn up Kurtzweil?
How'd you find me?
You a reporter?
He just let it explode.
See this bullshit...? Somebody knows I'm talking to you.
What is it? Kiddie porn again? Sexual battery of a patient? I've had my license taken away in three states.
For what? Because I'm a dangerous man. Because I know too much about the truth.
I was right about Dallas. Wasn't I, Agent Mulder?
You told me you had answers.
You've been using me --
Mulder -- it's me --
I've just climbed twelve floors. I'm hot and thirsty and I'm wondering, to be honest, what I'm doing here.
Alright... what'll it be: Coke, Pepsi? A saline IV?
Where are you, Mulder?
Mulder? Tell me this is a joke.
...thirteen fifty six...
They were the ones that put us together.
This isn't about you, Scully. They're doing this to me.
What are you implying, Scully?
This is one of the firemen who died in Dallas?
It's like jelly.
Mulder, this is going to take some time, and somebody's going to figure out soon enough we're not even supposed to be here.  I'm in serious violation of medical ethics.
You said you weren't coming?
This looks like new grass to you?
Why was I assigned to you? To debunk your work. To reign you in. To shut you down.
We're going to the morgue.
Well, call General McAddie.
I know.  Agent Scully reported your suspicions to OPR. On the basis of her report, I sent techs over to S.A.C. Michaud's apartment. They picked up PSTN residues on his personal effects consistent with the construction of the vending machine device in Dallas.
Is she alive?
What is it?
Aids, the ebola virus -- on the evolutionary scale they are newborns. This virus walked the planet long before the dinosaurs.
More concerns than that?
My god...
We're going to tell them what we've found. What we've learned. Turn over a body infected with the gestating organism.
Let me remind you who is the new race. And who is the old.  What could be gained by withholding anything from them; By pretending to ignorance? Our knowledge may forestall their plans to step up the timetable. To start Colonization early.
Our vaccine may have no effect!
Did we go sailing?
He hates me.
We've been over this a dozen times.  No.
Don't bring it home in this.
Like a New Year's Day hangover.
I'll come by tomorrow after work.  With dinner.
What if he wasn't like this?  What if he was "normal?"  Conscious.  How far would you go?
Sometimes... Once they've been caught they feel a need for disclosure.  They have so much they want to tell. But they've never had a sympathetic ear. They need someone to understand why.  Stargher used to hide the bodies very carefully.  It was part of the ritual. Some weren't found for weeks and any physical evidence had been meticulously wiped clean.  But these last three... They were still in water - always in water - but  Listen, he wasn't just careless.  It went beyond that...
I read about a woman in TExas who was in a coma for seven years.  Every time her husband came to visit, her heart would beat faster.  Isn't that something?  I don't know what name scientists have for something like that...
Agent Novak?
Absolutely.  I suppose everyone does.
With Stargher I saw things...
Why'd you bring him here?
What happened?
Remember, Julia Hickson is priority number one.  Nothing else matters.  Find out where she is.
I heard Julia and John got married.
Well look at that.
He's mine?
They're hungry.
Thank you.
Oh no... No you don't.
She the one from Santa Cruz?
Already there.
Yep.  And guess who they hired to seal up the place?
That's why we monitor the use of the drugs so closely.  We don't want her getting to that degree of perceptual disorientation.
What about the legalities of this...?
Here he is.
After three years she remembers what the guy drove?
Why jeopardize what we've already done? We caught the sonofabitch.  Carl Stargher.  That's going to be like Bundy, Gacy, Dahmer.  A case that makes careers.  But if we push our luck.  If this is all bullshit and we come out smelling like it.
Ich weiss nicht.
Thank you.
You shouldn't get mixed up in this.
Drink?
Harry?
Who are you looking for now?
Might as well I suppose. Are you busy?
Can I hear you?
I can try. Is it comedy, or tragedy?
...to steal my girl.
That's Harry's place, isn't it?
He's better dead. I know he was mixed up - but not like that.
Are you going, too?
Harry.
...anyway?
Cigarette, Miss Schmidt?
...parents.
Must you take those letters? CALLOWAY Yes, I'm afraid so.
That's the reason.
Joseph Harbin...
Now then, Miss Schmidt, I'm not interested in your forged papers - that's purely a Russian case. When did you last see Lime?
That's what we want to find out.
Thank you, you have been so kind. Anna moves down to stand CL of Paine.
...Austrian Police Headquarters.
Been here long?
Must have known I was broke. Even sent me an airplane ticket. It's a shame.
...to him.
Listen, Callaghan.
Tactful too, aren't we, Callaghan?
Miss Schmidt.
Get the next plane.
That is the racket Harry Lime organized.
So would I.
I followed his shadow until suddenly...
I was on that side, the shadow was on that side, and no turnings on either side.
I tell you I heard him running ahead of me.
It wouldn't work.
Win what?
Calloway, can't you do something about Anna?
Wait a minute - let me out.
Be sensible, Martins.
Very good, sir.
...excuse me.
...his number.
You do!
What's that?
Listen, Harry - I didn't believe that...
Hmm.
Did the police believe you?
You told them, didn't you?
We came out of his place like this, and were walking this way. A friend of his called to him from over there. Harry went across and from up there came the truck. It was just about here.
Not necessarily. She'd probably want to help.
Not yet.
Vinkel...You've got quite a collection of er-collection.
Speak English?
Happened...Yes happened right down there.
There was a third man - he didn't give evidence.
Fer von mir aus gehen sie zur gansalt aber mich lassen sie aus mit der politzei.
That's all you meant?
Lime.  Harry Lime.
Look, I'm sorry to bother you but I was wondering if you could help me out.
Ten dollars. I'll find a way to pay you back. How would you like to know About somewhere special? The perfect beach. Paradise. No one else knows about it. That's got to be worth something. What do you say?
What are you doing in Thailand? Tourist?
You go to Patpong? See smoke from pussy, ping pong ball from pussy, razor blade from pussy; bird from pussy.
It's arranged. Tomorrow morning. Eight hundred bath.
Yes, of course I can swim. How far do you think it is?
Oh. Great. Not far at all. I don't like to be negative, but do you think we should let someone know where we're going?
Richard - I saw a fin!
He tried to borrow money from us.
He said if we lent him money h would tell us about a secret beach.
Did you sleep well?
Have you told someone?
There are infinite worlds out there, where anything that can happen does happen.
Exactly.
We lost our key.
They only kill them when they love them?
Read the early Zionists on European Jewry; they sound like Goebbels.
Fucking Danny, man...
What, do you like it here?
Oh, please...
What do you care?
It's called the flame alphabet. It's supposed to be the word of God written in fire.
Fifty's an exaggeration. Anyway, that was a different moment. Things were possible that aren't now.
The point is, the modern world is a Jewish disease.
Where'd you get this?
Va-yomer... And he said.  It goes the other way.
I want to learn to read it.
With you there's a tragic dimension.
Fuck that.
The real Nazis. Hitler, Goebbels, they talked about Jews incessantly.... You ever read their diaries?...
I didn't notice his shoes.... Did your mother know he was there?
Who's Eichmann?
Why are you taking that?
An investment banking house.
They used to. Today it's not an issue.
But when it comes out, the public will be outraged. It will look like Germany all over again.
They left an hour ago.  You mind some personal advice? Forget Carla. That's not the side your bread's buttered on.  How soon can you get back to the city?
Let me give you an example.... Sexuality.
You ever fuck a Jewish girl?
Yes. It's very pleasurable. But the Jews are obsessed with it. You know why?
You're not listening. He isn't better. He gives pleasure, but that's actually a weakness.
Those aren't Jews.
Who? How would I know him?
Were you ever bar mitzvahed anywhere else?
Why would Nadelman lie?
Give me a reason not to.
Did you kill Ilio Manzetti?
Two days ago you addressed a Nazi rally. Last week you went to a Torah study group.
It's too late.... If I didn't, somebody else would.  Yom Kippur starts at sundown. Will you go to synagogue?
I work in the DA's office. You go to those meetings, half the people there are informants.
Which <i>Times</i> guy?
Think about your father. Your sister.
Balint?
Beth Shalom? What are you talking about? Who is this...?
You can have chicken with eggs but not with milk. Why is that?
He's going to die.  He won't take his medicine. He eats dairy. He probably still smokes when I'm not around.  I asked him to come live with us. Alex offered to share his room, unsolicited.... But he didn't want to be any trouble.
Who knows what that is?
That was unbelievable what you did to Lucas. The guy's an animal.
Get out of here....
What is it?
Shut up. Fuck you....
Open it up.
What about Drake, did he ever show up?
Didn't you get anything?
Oh, what is this shit?
The Manzetti thing must have scared her. She thinks she'll get implicated.
Take a right on 59th...  We'll put it someplace else.
It's not going to be fine. It's --
Where do you think you're going?
Who's this?
After your mother died, that's when you stopped going to shul. Doing your homework. Everything.
We tested the new bomb.
May He cause the light of His countenance to shine upon you and be gracious unto you....
The papers are going to report tomorrow that your colleague, Curtis Zampf, has been a federal informant for the past two years. Do you believe that?
I think, he's really nice... He's a funny guy... sometimes even very moving.
Maybe you should talk to him about it.
I was thinking of something kinda stupid last night.  You know those women in the greek mythology that made love with the Gods.  Take Leda for example, sleeping with Jupiter, who came to earth as a swan... Well, can you imagine Leda announcing to her swan "You're going to be a father, my little chick-a-dee"?
Johana, am I boring you?
Did the driver really freeze?
It can't be true!
Yes.  Of course.  Very wise.
Forever.  We used to live on the same island in Greece, when we were kids.
And just where are you from?
Okay, now we have a good five minutes to have a nice peaceful talk.
A little... You think it's the same for Jacques?
He can learn.  He is learning.
Dollars.
Roberto?  How long?
Santini will do that for 25 dollars!
Enzo, really.  What are you going to get?
What about the shoes?
The medics are looking all over for you.
Listen we're not supposed to piss either but that doesn't stop you from carrying "it" on board?!
Is that alcohol?  Are you out of your mind?  Alcohol is strictly forbidden.
It's okay, Enzo.  I'll go somewhere else.
It's okay.
Enzo?
Your mother?
Why?
The size of the lungs has nothing to do with it!
Tell me, why don't you go and get your medal?
What?
... Push me back in the water...
Don't you have a heater?
Would it be out of place to ask what he's doing?
But what brought you to Sicily?
Thanks for helping with the bag.  It looks great!
You look adorable.
Jacques, you set a world record.
I'm going back home.
Because one shouldn't fall in love with creatures from the sea.
Yes you do.  You know exactly what I'm talking about.  You're afraid I want to hold onto you, and I do, but you're not ready... at least not for me.
Hello?
I'm being a pain, huh?
Bonjour Monsieur... Louis. 
You'll try again tomorrow?
Why?
Mayol... Mayol... No reservation.
Liar!  Thief!  Torturer!  When you were an orphan I nursed you at my breast.
... Since eight o'clock last night...!  You're in love.
What is it honey... the frenchy?
What's that little air bottle on the machine?
Who... Who is that?
My dear, science is a cruel mistress.
It depends.  He should come up soon.  Unless he's decided to stay for the night.
Okay, listen, just get the custom's office to send me a copy as fast as possible.  We can't send you new equipment until our file is complete.  Okay?
A settlement completely demolished, ten smashed army jeeps, four dead Arabs. G dash D damn it, Hammer! You think you're above the Ten Commandments? Just find Santa Claus and bring him back to us. No heroics, got it?
Please. Will you help me?
Well, for starters, we're going to honeymoon in Boca for a week. And then, when we get back, Morty's been talking about taking a stable, good paying job as a consultant for the JDL.
Any sign of Santa?
So, now what?
What!?
I want for our children to go to private schools and take music lessons. Little Abraham will go to Stanford for college, Batya will go Ivy League, maybe Vassar.
Also, on a daily basis, I want you to tell me what to do, where to do it, and how I should live my life.
We do!
I love you too. I'm sorry about freaking out yesterday. I was wrong.
Esther!
Esther!
Shabat Shalom mama. I brought some Manischewitz. The black label.
Mordechai. Do you love your mother?
Mom, I have a real job. I do good things for this community. I help people.
Let's let your tuchus breathe.
Anything else?
Cool. What's it do?
Sorry folks, I don't do couples.
What are you doing?
Hey everybody. How's it hangin'?
I shlepped all the way to the North Pole for this? I come to fight you, and you don't even put out anything to nosh on? What kind of arch nemesis are you?
So, what's our first plan of attack Santa?
What should I charge?
Maybe I should just forget all about money - - forget about mamma and the kids and the rent, huh - marry some poor dope like -- oh, like Carlos Dominguez - - and get fat and --
Nobody. A boy who works in a grocery.
Well, Charlie, just why do you think your cat didn't kill the Contreras girl?
Can't make a buck without my leopard. I tell you, Mr. Manning, you gotta find that cat for me -- or pay up.
That cat ain't mean. I feed him out of my own hand for six years. Why don't he kill me? At night in the truck, I let him out of the cage. When I am falling asleep I hear him walking back and forth. I go to sleep. He don't hurt me.
Charlie wasn't drunk last night.
I want him to lock me up.
Well -- did he give you a lot of money?
Cut.
Something black -- something on its way to you --
Don't look at it!
Oh, dear -- I don't know what I'm going to do without you - honestly, I don't --
Oh, that's so interesting!
Yes. I want to go out and patrol the town - be everywhere at once - be sure nothing happens to anybody.
Doc -- something you said the other day --
It doesn't jibe with this -- you told me the leopard would go out into the country -- it wouldn't stay in the city --
He'd act normally when he was with other people. It would be a man who suffered remorse and even pity when it was all over.
What do you do now?
That was unfortunate.
Wait --
You can go now, Manning. There is no way we can hold you legally responsible.
I haven't done any posse work since last time I rode with Toni Mix at the old Bijou Theatre -- aged six, If you're interested,
Yes, there is something wrong. People who want publicity and don't mind how they get it --what risks they make other people run - - what agony and sorrow they bring to other people --
Chief, don't you understand what this means?
Makes no difference.  Get him out.
On his back, I suppose.
No -- not yet.
Suppose I slip them a few bucks - for the funeral expenses.
I suppose he was trying to make me feel bad.
It must be the altitude -- you, bucking around the countryside with a lot of boot-and-saddle boys --
Our first real break -- and we throw wild animals at the audience
I can use them.
Why do you want to stay around here? It'll only make you feel badly.
All right, I'm not ashamed of it! I split it two ways -
No. No, thanks.  Now we've got to do it ourselves.
Kiki?
I hated you that day -- you and your flip talk -- with that little girl lying dead.
For your information, Mr Lombard, trouble is possibly the one thing Leon is capable of getting into all by himself. Though I doubt he will not ultimately fail even at that.
Can it be that easy?
I found this at your brother's.
I will of course do my best to hang onto it.
I can't tell you that yet. But he's being well looked after.
How dare you...  You don't know this tape belongs to my brother, do you, Mr Lombard?
Get out of my house. You're fired, Mr Lombard.
The family hired you and I have just fired you, Mr Lombard.
Thank you for coming. Come in and close the door, will you?
Minimizes the risks. Children can be moved across borders using reliable businesses. These can also be used to move women and drugs... Anything that makes money really.
Are you all right?
Black suits you.
You know he'd have had him killed, don't you? Does a conscience still burn somewhere inside your sore mind, Deborah? Or is it just cold expediency? Could the boy perhaps come in useful when and if the day ever comes for you to face up to the man you married?
Is there anything to understand?
A fright?... Five years of cowardice led to your brother being murdered and you wanted to give his murderer a fright?
Something like that?
To get me killed...?
Do you think the boy you saved might identify your husband as his purchaser, Deborah? And then, your brother's not buried yet. As I said earlier, an autopsy will...
They found his body yesterday. In the pool at our house in Sao Paulo. He drowned. Drank too much, went for a swim and drowned.
The staff don't know yet...  I called my parents, told them everything...  I just couldn't take any more...
Why the hell couldn't you divorce the man?
Directory enquiries. Can I help you?
Good morning, sir. How can I help you?
I'm sorry, sir. Could you try that again?
The word for those things is croissants.
You're sure you won't sit down, Miss Stewart?
I can't believe this...  What's coming now, eh? If I don't pay all Hell's gonna break loose, is that it?
Have you never heard of collect calls, Mr...
You know where to look for your Austrian, right?
A recent acquisition. We've had four break- ins this year alone; files stolen, computers wrecked, faeces smeared on walls. The good guys dismiss us as alarmist do-gooders; the bad guys will risk prison to intimidate and rob us. An easy living indeed, Mr Lombard.  I got through to Moreau and Jane. I left your landlord out of it. Your flat's been broken into. Jane wants you to call her back.
Thank you for the guided tour, but would you mind telling me what we're doing here?
Right... Well, I'll get your money first thing in the morning, okay?  Okay. Goodnight then.
Route 395. Past Edwards Air Force base and about half a mile before a place called the Red Mountain Motel. There's a dirt track with a 'Closed to the public' sign. It leads to some kind of ranch in the middle of nowhere. If you haven't heard from me by morning send the cavalry, okay? But not before, you hear?
Look, you don't tell me about some Godforsaken place where stuff so bad even I couldn't imagine it goes down and expect me to go quietly to sleep! What happened? Who's the guy? The Austrian?
Shit! Fuck! What's fucking wrong with people!  I'm going to bed. And sweet dreams to you to! 
So, what are you looking for?
Fifteen for a straight delivery. Twenty with the provision of a safe place. Visitors tend to find the second option more convenient.
Where is the Austrian?
Who are you?
What about the staff?  They're in on what's going on, aren't they?  How many of them?
I'm sorry but Mr Gluck is not answering, sir.  Would you like to leave a message?
You sure you passed on my message?
I don't know. How many famous French film directors can there be?
I've got work tonight, Jane.
She's pretty... See you, huh?
Piss off!
What if it is?
Must I speak to you in French?
I take it your son is called Leon?
I presume you checked your son's apartment...
I take it your son is not married, Mrs Spitz?
?10,000 a year to the girl for as long as she looks after the boy?
What happens now?
Friedman lives with you at the Ambassador?
Is this Friedman?
The person who put us in touch seems to think so.
Will you be alone?  The merchandise. Is it just you or...
In my jacket. Left inside pocket.
A private investigator... You're not Austrian?
What's a French private investigator doing here?
No! What do you want here? How do you know me?
We didn't quite make it as lovers... Leon is a good man, though...
Who else knows about the boy?
Is she on the phone?
I've been away.  Did Leon speak to you about his sister?
Did he ever refer to the hostility between them?
You sure? What about before he turned up with the boy?
And you ain't neither one of those damned Mexicans who end up littering the landscape after getting ripped-off by their friendly cross- border guides, are you, mister?
Now, can you stand up?  Can you use your legs and stand up?
Los Angeles is 100 miles away.
Yeah. Why? You're going to look for her... Shit! You really think his pictures are that good?
Qu'est-ce que tu veux?
Mon bureau co?tait trop cher.
We are so alike, Xavier. Still, sometimes I wonder which one of us is the ugliest.
Okay, shitbag. I'm only going to ask you this once. Where is Friedman?
Three...
You're the lantern man, huh?  If you wanna see what's left of him...
Try again, and this time be polite.
Not even scum like Friedman would go to the trouble of killing a stranger on the strength of one anonymous call.
When they realise I'm missing...
Costliest!
Why not you -- Jean d'Aulon?  The only man who's poorer than I am, and so the only man I can trust. Dignified, honorable, wise... what more could we ask of a king?
My dear Aulon...  That's fine...
Jean, it's... it's not so easy...
Jean... me dear, loyal Jean... why do you want to oppose the will of God?  Jeanne wanted to go to Compiegne -- we let her -- she got caught.  Then, on my personal orders, Regnault proposed 30,000 crowns for her ransom, and once again the answer was no.  And now you say she tried to escape, and the answer is still no.  Jean, open your eyes -- can't you see the hand of God in all this?
Yes.  I didn't confess today.
I thought you were an archer?
Jeanne, stop it!
The king said you're his finest archer...?
Jeanne...!  Are you alright?
It's been weeks since they spoke to me.  Since the coronation... no signs... nothing...
It's a trap!  They're buying time till they can bring over more soldiers from England!
No, but...
To be killed in battle?
Will you at least let me stay with you?
We must sound the retreat!
My gentle Captain... I'm staying.
... and maybe the king will give you some money, and a little land, and a title even...  ... wouldn't that be a fine thing? You, a lady of title!
But that was her order!
I can't read.
Do you have a sword?
Didn't you also carry a banner?
No, of course not... I never killed anyone...
Yes, maybe... I don't remember...
But if this trial seems fixed, I fear you'll have the very opposite result to the one you want...
Calm down, my lord, I beg you!
Dead you're worthless, darling.
God defeated the English, not me.
Are you alright?  Did they hurt you?
Oh, thank you Lord!  I'm so glad to see you!  I need to confess... I haven't been confessed since Easter... or been to Mass... Will you hear me now?
Who are you?
The English??
How old are you?
Jeanne, you are not helping yourself.  If you don't answer our questions properly, your refusal will be taken into account.
What did it tell you?
Tell us, Jeanne... do you often hear this voice?
Let me clarify things for you, Jeanne.  On the one hand there is the Church Triumphant, that is to say God, his saints, and the souls that are saved.  And then there is the Church Militant, that is to say our Holy Father the Pope, the cardinals, the prelates of the Church, the clergy, and all good Catholic Christians.  Moreover this Church, when assembled, is guided by the Holy Spirit and therefore cannot be in error.  That is why we ask you to submit to the Church Militant... that is to say, us.
Sign this, and I will confess you myself if you want.
Please... may I have it back...
This word is -- regrettably appropriate for the situation.  In fact what we -- the Church -- wish to do is determine whether or not this girl is sent by God, as she claims.  You understand that we cannot allow just anybody to abuse God's name in this manner...
What was my mission?  To help my country?  But how could I do that? I was only a poor girl who knew nothing about riding or making war... so I decided to wait and not to speak to anyone about it.
Ah, Jeanne... come here...!  This whole coronation idea of yours is a fiasco... nothing is ready...
So how would you put it?
Does he have hair?
Is it long and hanging down?
5,000 gold crowns.
It is all his majesty can afford. He has even donated his very own personal savings.  His majesty will greatly appreciate a gesture of good will in this delicate negotiation between our two families.
Good.  Can you bring me to him?
Wait, wait...
Jeanne, that really makes no sense at all.  The Tourelles is virtually impregnable... besides, if we're on the other side of the river attacking the Tourelles, what's to stop Talbot attacking the city from the north?
Well...?  Shall we go?
My lord Dunois... I have wonderful news! -- finally -- he's sending her to us -- thanks be to God -- we're saved -- it's wonderful!
Brilliant idea... but to be really effective, why not send a whole army of virgins?
I do love her when her fire gets well and truly stoked!
This is no good!
Bravo!  What about all the other hundreds of prisoners?  Do we let them go too?
Jeanne... The men are exhausted!
Who told you to wear men's clothes?
You mean it was not of your own free will that you were on the ledge?
And you didn't jump of your free will?
So who gave the order to bring me to this side of the river??
Jeanne, let me introduce the king's half brother, the dogged Lord Dunois.
Who gave you that horse?
What have you done to me?
Who... who are you...?
Who are you to even think you can know the difference between good and evil?  Are you God?
I don't know... please... tell me I'm dead...
I... don't know... what do you want from me?
I am true -- to my Lord, the King of Heaven.  He knows how much I love him -- that's all that matters to me...
That's too easy.  One minute you want to die, the next you want to live...  Do you think that life is a toy that can be played with and then broken when you don't want it anymore?
Oh, so you don't want war anymore? You want to be at peace?  You want to be able to change your mind anytime you feel like it and expect everyone to go along with it?
Yes... that's what I pray for...!
They won't come anyway.
Why would they?
No.  That was a sword in a field.
I'm not lying, I... I can't remember... leave me alone!
Yes!  We fought and killed in His name... the King of Heaven!
I don't agree.  Why do you have to keep changing your mind all the time?
I'm trying to make my cross look more beautiful...
Because... because I don't know what else to do to please him.
Are you going to leave me too?
Yes I am.
You know what you just signed, Jeanne?  You just signed away my existence... For you I'm a lie, an illusion.  You see?  In the end, you were the one who abandoned me...
I saw a poor monk without shoes so I gave him some.
They weren't my shoes.  Mine were too small.
Good, good.  And your sister... Catherine -- she's still your best friend?
Him?
Beautiful.
I don't want to wait for his call.
Someone you know?
Dorota!
I need help.
And how's Yurek?
What did I tell you?
Must feel better this side of the wall.
The Gestapo found our weapons. They've arrested Janina and Andrzej. They're bound to find out about this place, too - you must get away at once.
wish I knew you better.
Can you help?
I've no money.
Yitzchak, they told me you had influence.
The Germans go into Jewish homes and they just take what they want, furniture, valuables, anything.
Boys, boys...
They bombed us, we're off the air.
No, no. Listen, I've been thinking --
A good place for what?  He's insane!
But...they won't get all of us... we'll...it's too small...there's four hundred thousand of us in Warsaw!
It's not funny.
It's nothing to do with you. It's me they wanted, not you. Why do you interfere in other people's business?
No one thought they'd hold out so long.
They're in shock. They didn't expect it. Nobody expected it. Jews fighting back? Who'd have thought?
There are notices going up. The city's to be cleansed of undesirables.
I thought you'd be off on tour, playing London, Paris, New York?
Fine, we're fine, thank you, and you?
Pig!
Dirty pig!
Have a favour to ask. I want to get out of here.
And what do you think you'll do while you're setting up a new line of defence? Wander round lugging your suitcases?
No, no, no, I'm staying put. If I'm going to die, I prefer to die at home.
What's happening?
I'll play the piano again. On Polish radio.
Szpilman.
Well you stopped combing your hair, which is a good thing, it was looking over done.  You see these are the slits that the heads will go through, show him Nessie ... they'll be dead, the Reverend is going to use animal blood, no doubt it will be very dramatic. Tea! 
We have just come from George Banes' and they have taken him over. It is no wonder he is leaving, he has got in too deep with the natives. They sit on his floor as proud as Kings, but without a shred of manners.
I knew she was mute, but now I'm thinking it's more than that. I'm wondering if she's not brain affected.
Oh, yes, yes of course, a concern.
He is quite altered, as if they had been trying some native witchcraft on him. Well tomorrow or the day after he will be gone.
I got the good wife for you Peini. She pray good. Clean. Read Bible. You sleep her Peini. She chief daughter.
She looks tired.
What for?
T-w~e-l-v~e.
I don't think you should have given up the piano. I will make sure you are properly taught, with music written on to sheets and...
No, words. You have never heard words?
No, but her words are in my head.  I know what you think, that it's a trick, that I'm making it up. No, the words I heard, were her words.
Please take us to the beach where we landed.
I know why Mr. Baines can't play the piano.
7 to 2.  That ain't bad.
Best we had was Cat's Eye in the second at Del Mar, and he was only 5-2.  Not many longshots comin' in today.
I dunno.  That little mug that got ya is mad enough at me already -- what if he's out there waitin' around a corner with some friends.
If that punk and his pals decide to search ya, you'll never fool 'em carryin' it there.
Listen Duke, we're setting up a wire store.  I need a twenty man boost right away.
In one goddamn night?  What are ya sprayin' money around like that for? You coulda been nailed.
No class grifter woulda' done it, that's all.
I'm gettin' too slow for this racket.  I done the best I'm gonna do.  You hang on too long, you start embarrassin' yourself.
Then why ain't he dead?
And tell Cole I wanta see him when he gets in.
I just got the count.  We'll put the take on the 4:15.
Hey, Luther told me he was carrying a wad, but I didn't figure this much.
It's important.  We had a little trouble in Chicago today.  One of our runners got hit for 12 grand.
Mottola.
I don't care.  Load me a deck.  Set it up for threes and nines.  I'll cut it in on his deal.
Turn the goddamn thing off, will ya.
I'm sorry about Luther.  He was the best street worker I ever saw.
How'd ya do?
No.
What's the problem?
I'm not sure I know it.
Yeh, that'd be real nice of ya, Mr. Lonneman.
See and raise 1,000.
She coulda killed me last night.
How do I know you're tellin' the truth.
My end was only one.
Excuse me, sir.  Treasury Dept... I'd like to ask you a few questions.
Then I'm afraid we'll have to impound your money until we're sure that it's all good.  Can I see your wallet and your ticket, please?
Look, I don't have time to fuck around.  There's somebody out there I don't need to see.  You got a fire escape or anything?
All right, do me a favor.  Go into the bathroom, open the window and wait for me there.
You sure it'll be one of these two?
What do you mean?
So could Shaw.
You should always look to the back too, kid.
Get on with it then.
You're not gonna break him with a $2,000 bet.
Lucky, hell.  I could do it every day.
No.
A week's a long time, friend. Anything can happen.  All of it bad.
You've already done time twice, and judges don't like three time losers. You wanna sit in the can for forty years, startin' tonight?
But who says you will.  I got a guy I can depend on.  He's liquidating everything he has for this.  You wouldn't even give Carver his money back.
On a 6-1 shot?  The hell with ya. We'll keep the deal we got.
We were getting 50 from our guy.
All right, Riley.  What the hell happened?
I'll need a room over there that faces this way.  How much a week?
Do ya know him or don't ya?
Don't crack wise to me, flatfoot. I spent a lotta time in dumps like this, eatin' Gondorff's dust while the bunco squad gets rich tippin' him off.  But it's not gonna happen this time.  We're not even gonna let the police know we're here.  If you keep your mouth shut and do a job, there'll be a promotion in it for ya.  And you better take it, cause I can make ya work for us without it.
Cheer up, darling.
Now don't say that -- he's just off somewhere working.
That's gone long ago.  I've got to see him.  Where is he?
Mother ....  you couldn't do that. You couldn't go to her.
Don't.  It's horrible.
How are you?  Here.  Get under this.
Did he tell you where he was going?
Not that scrawny little....? 
That's what I was going to ask you.  he's disappeared!
I don't know anything -- I've been in California for four years. What about his lawyer? Used to be a guy named Mac-- something.
How do you do?  I'm sorry we have to rush.
Come on in.
I don't know.
I hate all that fuss.  But I'll do it on one condition -- that you're there to give me away.
This is my wedding.
It's a secret.  I can't even tell you, my dear.  I've got an important idea to work on.
Yes.  And I don't want anybody to steal it from me.
Like all the rest of us.  Has this fellow...  ...has he seen the whole family?
How'd you people happen to pop in?
Ask him.  I don't know.
He's holding out on you.
Trail him!  Trail who?
Just rolled them up and threw them in.
Could this be him?
Are you kidding?
Why didn't you tell me? .... Why didn't you hold him?
Well....
I wasn't in.  My secretary took the message.  He left word for me to meet him at the Plaza.
Good morning --
She drives me nuts.  She's been ragging me all day.
That's a lie, Lieutenant...  Anybody that says that is a liar.
You'd done better to have told me that in the beginning.  Where were you the afternoon she was knocked off?
I know.
Who's that man?
The government bonds.  The ones you took from the office safe.
I'm not telling anyone.
How are you?
You don't say --
I see.  I see.
You know as much about it as I do. I haven't seen him in three months.
What are the chances of getting you to do what he wants?
It might.
Clyde Wynant's crazy... absolutely crazy to stay away at a time like this. No wonder the police think he has something to do with it.
Nick, you will help me find Clyde -- won't you?
But he knows you.  All you have to do is get in touch with him, and tell him that Mimi says everything is all right... but that I've got to see him.
Chris may be at the club -- or somewhere -- I don't see that it's important --
Oh, did he?  What did he say?
I gotta talk to you.  I want you to tell me something and I want you to give it to me straight. Get me?
How is Studsy?  I didn't know he was out of stir.
I'd tell you if I knew. But I'm not in this.  Ask the police.
Where did you get that?
What are you going to do with it?
No.
What are you going to give me?  I hope I don't like it.
Sure -- I don't even feel it.
Aren't you hot in that?
Is that another Christmas present?
What's the trouble, Asta?  Your balloon busted?  So's mine.
This may be a little rough - you'd better let us go alone.
I know but this is different. He's a crazy man. He might kill you.
Go on - go on - see if I care. But it's a dirty trick bringing me all the way to New York just to make me a widow.
Back to California
Nick!
Wynant's body?
What makes you so sure it's Wynant's body?
What things made you so sure?
But the poor kid's going crazy. She'd rather know her father was dead than that...
Why not?
Mimi!
I wish you'd tell me who.
Serve the nuts - I mean, serve the guests the nuts.
Nick Charles here?
You're forgetting the check for your suitcase.  It's at the Grand Central.
Home?
Who fired you?
Well, based on my knowledge of the region, its culture and her people I would have to say it's a box.
A casual one.
They shouldn't have been here.
This is miles from the battle lines. They were probably deserters.
What are you doing.
He's not so--
All we've got to do is make it to the top.
Where'd they go?
What about it?
We started this together, and we're staying together, so there's no point in splitting things up now.
You're the one with all the ideas.
You got no reason to do that!
Get off him.
That's what he says.  He could be a spy, or something.
You're out of your mind.
It's a combat action.
Thanks for taking care of this for me.
At-at-at-at-at.
Don't get pissed at me, just 'cause I want to be ready when this war starts.
Don't even.  You're not going to show me that tired map.
Wellllll, if you read it it must be true. Was it in the Star, or the Enquirer?
Third.  What you're going to do with your third.
Shut up!  Both of you shut the hell up!
What?
How'm I gonna relax standing on a mine!?
There's a way.
I said nobody dies.  Nobody dies.
I'm the one who can feel my leg, and it's falling asleep.
You're going to blow yourselves up.
You're not losing trust, are you?
I didn't have to stop anything, 'cause nobody was going to do nothing.  We're in this together, understand?
Well, it's Iraq.  I'm not sure, but I'm guessing that has something to do with them being here.
They're doing more than slapping.
Not enough.  We're out numbered and out gunned.  They'd cut us to shreds.
But the white dot in the middle; that's got to mean something.
Where the hell is it!?
What are we going to do?  What the hell are we going to do?
Must be a compartment.
I don't see how that plan's any better.
Wes might be right about that.
We should head Northeast.
What are we going to do?  How are we going to find our way back!?
How!?
We got to go back.  We got to go back for Wes.
We can't just leave him.
No.
What do you think our chances are?
Getting cold.
Well?
Oh, God...
Can't you--
Don't go bitch on me now!  You were going to kill me.  Kill them!
What do we do?
What do we do?
We had a deal.  No one touches the gold until we're out of here.  No one breaks the deal, no one had anything to worry about.
Why do I have to lie in the road?
Epps.
I want you to know... I don't know.  I just think you're a hell of a guy.
Epps?
Still am.  There's more gold than I thought, and since there's only two of us now...  Where should I go?
That shouldn't be too hard to read.  Iraq is the pink thing.
Ready for what?  Sight-seeing?
Some good ones.
Spanish wasn't hard enough?
Jaeger?
We...we could go home with something else.
You don't know where the Iraqis have moved to.  And our forces haven't even engaged the Republican Guard yet, we don't know--
It's not a hundred miles.  It's a hundred miles through three different kinds of terrain:  Pure desert, mountains, a river.  If the map is even real.
We're going to get court martialed, you know that.
This is too much.  You don't even have the money and you're wasting it.
Two vehicles.  They're not supposed to be here.
If all we wanted was the map out of you we could have taken it while you were standing on that mine pissing on yourself.
Maybe we should give him some water.
Think the Iraqi's killed them all?
Drug evasion with....
Now...now, I'm sorry...don't - don't....please.  It's just... I was happy.  Why get me involved? You told SEN that you weren't satisfied with me.
I was so scared...I didn't know what would happen with you...once I started.  I almost let you go on so many times.  It will be worth it, together.  When I was alone, I knew.
Three!  I'm going to be late for my shift.
What do you think you're doing? You're going to get us arrested.
I couldn't turn you in, not now. I....I know I wouldn't!
Then what?  It can't go on forever. You know it can't.
They're watching us now.
There goes another of your disciples.
What?
Who?  Who's leaving?
I can just barely see him.  I think he's leaving.
He's coming back for the rest of us.  He can't make it alone.
Wait!  I'll talk to him.
How far did you go?  Was it cold?
I'm sure it's warmer in her than outside, though.  I haven't been out yet, but it usually is...the control is fouled... 
You're in violation.
What are you doing here?  You're not cleared for this area!
What have you done, Cut your hand?
I knew him.
Remember this...?
Yes
Yes.
...rooms with her.  Our relationship is normal, conforming.  We share nothing but space.  What is she doing to...
May I help you?
And you are...?
There out on a call, perhaps I can help you-
f 2600 block of Lakefront. A limousine. But, I-
Dispatch, this is Reilly.
High-grade det cord. This girl, either she's got strange taste in jewelry or she's into serious demolition.
Sorry about that.  That's an inch of the stuff, imagine what the whole thing'd do.
Alright, let's check it out.
What was-? Why...?
What?
Now wait just a fucking-
By the way, I'm Glass. This is T.J., and Pooch.
The place has already be combed. Forensics pulled over a hundred sets of prints inside.
So what were they doing here?
There were a few guys in my class with names like John Smith, Bill Jones. I'd see them up ahead in the hall, call their name, but they wouldn't turn around. C.I.A. Funny thing, they'd always disappear after the first half of the course.
This is where the van was parked.
You guys seem pretty tight.
How long were you hooked?
It's working.
C'mon, talk to me! We can do it!
Wires... metal, cold... something soft...
More metal... sharp edge...
Yeah, another round thing.
What... ?
Assist? What the hell you know about tickers anyway?
What do you think?
Right.
Yeah, he's helping us work up a profile on this thing.
We've lost brothers too, we know what that's like.
C4, plastic explosive.
Relax, Pooch, it's just a ticker, it's not personal.
What's the matter?
Why are we stopping here?
I'm filing charges against that mother-
He is!
Nitro, dash of Semtrex, vegetable oil ...
Mike. No thanks, I'm fine.
Vice... Jesus.
Pooch, can you move it?
You outta the city... that's a fish out of water. What's with all this family talk lately, anyway?
I thought you said what's-her-name's brother was going to fix it.
Mike...
P.E.T.N ...
Captain...
Sir...
Yes, sir.
Reilly, what's happening? Reilly! Reilly! Do not engage. We're five minutes-
Yes.
Eleven o'clock! 
The representative of the police wants to know if there is anything wrong with your tonsils.
What did you talk about?
I wanted to say goodbye to you.
No.
No.
No!
Insignificant ... He's a secretary, always <u>was</u> a secretary, always <u>will</u> be.
Yes, sir?  What shall we start with, Baron?
It must be the most marvelous supper. We may not eat it, but it must be marvelous.
You're not safe anywhere nowadays.
You must be related to the Lavals of Marseilles.
Two weeks and three days.
Then why didn't you call the police? Why <u>don't</u> you call the police?  I'll tell you why--you crook, you.
Monescu.
No, no, no! I disagree with you absolutely. That's the trouble with you artillery men.
Do you <u>know</u> King Boris?
Thank you!
The pepper, too?
Thank you, Baron.
--the other half, contrary to custom, shall be delivered in cash into Madame's personal custody.  Darling, that means that on the second of June we'll have eight hundred and fifty thousand francs.
They're all right, aren't they?
Filiba ...
No--not yet--but--  Two tickets to Berlin--first class and sleeper--night train ... Right ... Right ... Leave them in the name of--Don Ignacio Fernandez ... Right ... Thank you. 
By the way, how is your German?
You <u>have</u> to get out of here!
Don't you <u>realize</u>--
And you--
Not in the least, madame. But you see, it's a very expensive bag--one has to be careful.
Well--how do you do, M'sieu Laval?
You needn't be embarrassed, madame. A lady as charming as you would, and <u>should</u>, get love letters.
But one suggestion, madame.  Not the major.  I don't  mind his grammatical mistakes. I'll overlook his bad punctuation. But the letter has no mystery--no bouquet--no ...  And one lipstick ...  Scarlet number four.
That's what you need!
Beautiful specimen.
And you made any attempt to handle your own business affairs, I would give you a good spanking--in a business way, of course.
I'll be delighted.
Well, we'll have breakfast in the garden.
Then riding together.
Beautiful.
Marvelous.
But attractive--
I want you to stay, Mariette. You've <u>got</u> to stay. You can't go now!
Instantly.
Two lumps, madame?
Right!
I think you'd better go.
Mademoiselle Gautier--or whatever your name is--I thank you for your advice, but I must ask you to go. You've got your money--
Then why did you do it?
Five compartments. She can stay afloat with the first four compartments breached. But not five. Not five. As she goes down by the head the water will spill over the tops of the bulkheads... at E Deck... from one to the next... back and back. There's no stopping it.
I saw the iceberg, Mr. Andrews. And I see it in your eyes. Please tell me the truth.
Won't you even make a try for it, Mr. Andrews?
This is Brock Lovett. What can I do for you, Mrs...?
None of the stewards have seen her.
Steerage swine. Apparently missed his annual bath.
You know I don't like that, Rose.
Those mud puddles were certainly a waste of money.
I was leaning way over, to see the... ah... propellers. And I slipped and I would have gone overboard... and Mr. Dawson here saved me and he almost went over himself.
Is that the going rate for saving the woman you love?
I had hoped you would come to me last night.
Yes. Your exertions below decks were no doubt exausting.
Something serious has happened.
Oh, Mother shut up!  Don't you understand? The water is freezing and there aren't enough boats... not enough by half. Half the people on this ship are going to die.
Yes, I lived. How awkward for you.
Is this in any way unclear?
You're a good liar.
'Cause you're goin' to America!! Full house boys!
You can smell ice, you know, when it's near.
The suction will pull us right down if we don't keep going.
Captain, the press knows the size of Titanic, let them marvel at her speed too. We must give them something new to print. And the maiden voyage of Titanic must make headlines!
Well, do you think the ship is seriously damaged?
Jack... I feel like such an idiot. It took me all morning to get up the nerve to face you.
Penguin? Oh, Cal! He is them.
You have a gift, Jack. You do. You see people.
And...?
So then what, Mr. Wandering Jack?
Jack, must you go?
That was a long one. My father used to say that whenever you saw one, it was a soul going to heaven.
Fabrizio said you might be up --
Cal insist on lugging this thing everywhere.
Pretty tough for a valet, this fella.
So... how did you find out I didn't do it?
I'm not going without you.
Look for something floating. Some debris... wood... anything.
Louis the Sixteenth wore a fabulous stone, called the Blue Diamond of the Crown, which disappeared in 1792, about the time Louis lost everything from the neck up. The theory goes that the crown diamond was chopped too... recut into a heart-like shape... and it became Le Coeur de la Mer. The Heart of the Ocean. Today it would be worth more than the Hope Diamond.
Rose, tell us more about the diamond. What did Hockley do with it after that?
Don't come any closer.
I don't understand you. It is a fine match with Hockley, and it will insure our survival.
Here's to Europe!  Couldn't try to look a little less glum, could you?
Well--shall we go into dinner?
Did you muss up her hair by accident, too?
How do you do. Would you care to finish the game? I have a slight earache.  --and it's so noisy up here.
A rare pleasure to meet you, ma'am! Where I come from --out in Montana--we have some pretty women, but I guess if you walked down Main Street they'd turn out the fire brigade.
Will you pardon me?
Did you find it?
Hmm! So am I. If you'll excuse me I have some important unfinished business. I'll see you all later.
Could I see you a minute?
In that case--you owe us exactly sixteen hundred dollars.
Don't thank me. Do you recognize me without the lipstick?
How about giving me another coat?
This is great. I'll be able to watch your act every night.
Don't stop, nurse--I think I'm going to faint.
You know, you're not a <U>bad</U>-looking girl. In fact--I think you're lovely.
When?
Fatal fascination of James Brett wins out.
What?--
Seven-fifty. Positively my last offer.
If I was smart I wouldn't be working my way over on this ship. 
You're a wise guy--Gimme back--
Yeah--but high livin's made me soft.
Maybe she's in the show--One of the troupers--did you ever think of that?
Here--drop it where they'll find it and return it to him. He's not a bad egg. I'll ship him back the fifty before we arrive.
Here's your twenty-five hundred, Mr. Brett.
Thank you, sir. 
On the drunk.
I'll bet a couple of hundred--  I wonder what's keeping that boy.
Before that. Your face is very familiar.
It'll be very interesting to see how you go about solving this, Inspector--
I wouldn't worry about it--it'll turn up--  How about a nightcap, Inspector?
You know what I'd do, if I were you--before the card game I'd go to the Purser's office.
Well, someone else besides myself may have seen you in the vicinity of Mrs. Rosson's cabin this evening--even the stewards in that corridor insisted on being searched. Get me?
It's easy to see the Purser hasn't had much practice.
This has nothing to do with me--  But always remember, Purser, when you're searching anybody, take the lining of their coat, like this--  --run your fingers all along these seams.... Then-- back of the collar--<U>here</U>--that used to be a favorite trick--and never forget to put your finger down inside of the shoe--like this.
Don't get yourself all worked up--
Mmmmmmmmmhm....  Now, Jimmy, what were you doing in that corridor before the shots were fired?
Their faces are familiar--but not to each other.
No--I'll take Sally and give you the best of it.
That's all right. I'll attend to this.
She was to meet me here--why don't you wait? She ought to be here any minute.
O.K., kid--  I'm only sorry for one thing.
"Will--be--back--in--four--weeks." You don't need the "will be." Just say "Back in four weeks."
Just a minute--I don't think we need the word "Back" --Where <U>is</U> "Back"?
Fine! Instead of saying "next month"--we'll use one word and say "June."
That's great! There's the address and message all in one word.
Yes--Me--in person!
Hello, Denby!
McKinney's the name.
Those kids seem to be getting along fine!--
Hello, Inspector--I hear your vacation's been spoiled. Somebody lost a bracelet.
Well, that's something--even if only the fish can see it.
Are you paying any attention to his jokes?--the first thing you know, you'll be taking piano lessons from Venus de Milo--  Get out of here. 
Looks like your old workshop back on 42nd Street.
Swell--You've got Times Square right here--all but the noises--
You never fail at anything, do you, Chad?
I came to tell you what a swell guy I think you are to do this--
It wasn't only that--Ned was in a jam.
Come on, now--you've forgotten all about that.
Yep--everybody's having a good time but me--What do you want, Mary?
But, Mary--everybody's having such a great time-- why spoil it?
Well, let's hear the poem--
H'mm--<U>Dear</U> Atlantic--
When it falls off the table and turns turtle--Cute?
--And he has sex appeal.
Never mind the Who's Who--Before I get on this boat I want to know What's What! How about my raise? All I get out of these ocean trips is dizzy.
You're wasting your time--she's a friend of mine.
The man that marks them is an artist--two hundred and fifty bucks for six decks--and they're worth it.
Out my way in Montana we always call a bluff. 
He's all right.
You leave the kid alone.
--you'd go with him!
Don't, Lee--that's dead.
There you are, sir.
He's certainly good-natured.
Oh, for Christ's sake!
God damn son of a...
Oh, my God...
Newcomers, eh?  Names John Behan, I'm Cochise County Sheriff.  Just Hit town?
What d'you think of the singer?
Where'd you get that horse?
I asked where you got him.
Ain't our way.  We go all on one, One on all.  Fight one of us, you Fight us all.  That's the Cowboy way.
Oh, we ride for a brand all right.  This brand.  How 'bout you?
Let me, let me, yeah!  Die, you Bastard...
That's just my game.
On three?  You call it.
Why Johnny Ringo, you look like Somebody just walked over your grave.  Oh, I wasn't quite as sick as I Made out.
That's my lovin' man.  Just can't Get enough.
We must talk, darling.  It appears We have to... redefine the nature Of our association.
Doc!  How the hell are you?
Sheriff Behan, Doc Holliday.
Maybe I ought to go out there.
I'm a man without fear, Wyatt.  I Literally don't care if I live or Die.  But even I can't fight human Instinct.  Somebody suddenly Starts shooting at me, I duck. But you... what on earth were You thinking about?
Well hell, Wyatt.  Wyatt, I want You to meet Father Feeney.  Father Feeney's just been initiating me Into the mysteries of the great And ancient Church of Rome.  You See, it appears my hypocrisy Knows no bounds.
Rather an obvious question under The circumstances, don't you Agree?  A better one might be how Do you feel?
I imagine it would, yes.  So now We can add self-pity to your list Of frailties.
First you can grab that black- Haired woman and make her your own.
You know, Stephen Foster.  "Oh, Susanna".  "Camptown Races", Stephen-stinkin'-Foster!
Told you.  I'm red hot, I'm Blazin'!  Now, red seven.  Seven Stinkin' diamonds.  Look out!  Five Thousand!  Let's go!
You tell Ringo... just tell him I'll be there.
You know, we might just pull this off.
Wyatt, listen, you can't beat Him.  You're good and God knows You got the courage, but you Ain't in Ringo's class.  Hell, He's the best that's ever been. 'Cept maybe for Wild Bill.
Doesn't suit you.
See?  You're laughing again.  But That's what I want.  Go places and Move and never look back and just Have fun.  Forever.  That's my idea Of heaven.  Need someone to share It with, though.
Oh look, I haven't got time to be Proper, I want to live.  I'm a woman, I like men.  If that's Unladylike then I guess I'm not a Lady.  At least I'm honest.
What's wrong?
I have to go.
Florentino!  He's getting away!
I know that cut.  You mean there's A waterhole near there?
There they are.  No herd though.
Dropped him, that was it.  Sorry If I made a worse mess for you.
I just got it fixed.
Go ahead.  Skin it.  Skin that Smoke wagon and see what happens.
Easy, gents. Private affair...  Wyatt! Doc! Hey!
Allie-girl...And Louisa!  You're So lovely.  I'm at your feet, Darlin'.  Just at your feet.  Guess it's only right.  Ma always Said you were the prettiest.
Look pretty rough.
Her maiden name was Sullivan.
I appreciate your assistance, M. But this is now a military operation.
Good evening. I've just spoken with the Prime Minister at the economic summit in Tokyo; he's expecting a full update within the hour.  For those of you still unaware, some forty minutes ago -
A piece of advice, Mr. Bond: Don't screw with a man who buys ink by the ton.  It's deadlier than uranium.
Still, I do miss her. I only wish she could have lived to see all this.
By the way - what is it that brings you to Kuala Lumpur, Mister Bond?
Welcome to the new world order, Mr. Bond.  Churchill had his armies; Caesar had his legions; I have my divisions:  News, sports, business, entertainment. And these are my foot soldiers:  2000 people working on 14 floors to feed 300 newspapers, 4 cable news networks, 87 magazines, and 29 different cable TV channels - in 35 languages.
Or disinformation... If you wanted to, say, beam down a signal to send a ship off course? Maybe one degree a minute?
...And what's that, my dear?
Are your guards really going to kill a helpless girl?
In the Strait of Malacca, when a boat is even five minutes late, one begins to worry, Mr. Bond.
The Kuala Lumpur ferry was 35 miles off-course that night. Captain blamed the auto-pilot; I suspected he was drunk - until the Sumatra ferry captain had same problem.
Next morning. Both boats. Nothing wrong.  My 90 year old grandfather thinks 'Ghost in the computer - Silicon Dragon.'
I'm sure she is, James. But I'm afraid you'll have to 'kiss off' the rest of your lessons this afternoon.
By the way, James: Ordinarily I would never ask, but... Weren't you and that Colonel once stranded on a raft for two weeks in the Sargasso Sea?
What - no lust for adventure?
Do I have to dial '9' to get out?
Wait a minute -
Stop it! You're hurting me! Can't you just be nice?
What about Elliot Harmsway? Or is this just another one of your stunts?
Do you feel better now?
I'm so sorry, James. I promise, I'll never leave you again.
Paris -
His newspapers?
More scurrilous, unsubstantiated gossip.
It was an authorized test. I returned the money.
I dunno, Jimbo. It can't be out here. How could they get this far off course?
They'd never sail this close to the shore.
I got you covered.
Sidney Winch, meet -
... Does this do anything?
Married?
No.
Here. I gave you my assistant's phone number. If it's urgent, she knows where to reach me.
Actually, I'm here on business. You might say it was a... Golden opportunity.
Do I have to do everything around here?
I hope you'll be gentle.
... Do you have a gun?
Blood or Dutch?
Here. You shoot. I'll drive.
Another reason??? Did I miss something???
If it's radio controlled, it'll break the code.
Sleep well?
And when might that be?
.... I hate to ask, but... Did you ever think you'd miss Communism?
The infrared satellite images. No heat, no flame, no explosion. If that boat went down where they said it did, there should have been some residual heat reading on the surface.
I know my rights. These are international waters. The British Navy abandoned that boat, and I'm claiming it. Under international law, I have the right to salvage what's on that wreck.
The American presidential candidate called to complain about that sex story -
Please, Sidney. I'd like to remember you fondly.
Take the men. I can finish alone.
- Built to withstand a nuclear blast.  Are they alive?
Oh, no.
Your mother asked me not to mention it but your mother's birthday was last week.
You want me to mortgage my house to invest in a scheme of yours? You know the last time we went into something together Daddy had to go in his savings to keep us from ending on the street.
This is not a good time to take chances. Your best friend, Robert, an accountant, lost his home and is out on the street. We see him from time to time. He comes down to church for a free meal.
Robert asks about you. When are you going to do something to help him?
That is a damn lie and you know it. Every time father asks you to do something, you either half-ass do it or run off and hide. Mama asked you to turn the dirt in her garden and you told her, with your smart ass self, that you weren't a farmer; get Junior to do it. Every time someone asks you to do something, you always say, tell Junior to do it. Boy, you ought to grow up.
I'm leaving and don't even call me when the shoe falls 'cause all he did for me was to try and run my life. I'm tired of people saying Babe Brother this, Babe Brother that. What's my name?
I'll drive her to the hospital.
Why does he always pick on me?
Linda, how come you don't see that Sunny puts his shoes on right?
It was like all those things old country people try to tell you what hell is like.
Who is it?
Harry is coming to pick me up.
Well, you just have to move further out.
Let us settle this tomorrow.
I'm not going to let him get away with murder.
He ain't nothing like me. How come a man has to have sons that are day and night apart? You ought to stop protecting him.
You're always taking his side.
Well, it's up to Suzie.
I have to feed the chickens before they wake everybody up.
I came all the way from Detroit by bus going to Oakland. The bus stopped in Los Angeles. I had to get off and take a rest. I'll catch the last bus leaving at midnight. I'm just too tired to go on.
What could have caused this? I just changed this damn thing.
That smells like fresh coffee.
Good afternoon, ladies.
Hocker's death almost caused a race riot. A lot of innocent people could have been hurt behind that.
I think if anybody had a hand in killing Hocker, you ought to ask or you should have asked Emory and Chick.
I couldn't believe it when Suzie called and said you were staying here. How have you been?
You don't act like the rest of Gideon's friends. They believe if you are not hard at work, you are hard at sin.
Some folks take that natural stuff too far.
I asked Harry about it. He didn't own up to it. He said he didn't know what got into Okra.
What must I do?
You shouldn't talk about the boy's father in front of him. This is family business and we have to pull together.
Where is Skip?
I'm sorry he got those birds.
How are you?
Yeah!
I looked everywhere, honey, but all I could find was your hat.
Aach! -- Oh, hi, Bo.
We're almost there.
Yes, it is a mistake, because, you see, the bed, here, is my spot.
Yes, I can.
And another thing.  Stop with this spaceman thing.  It's getting on my nerves.
You actually think you're THE "Buzz Lightyear?" Oh, all this time I thought it was an act!  Hey, guys!  Look!  It's the REAL Buzz Lightyear!
Oh, no, no, no...  Buzz, look!  An alien!
Oh.  Oh, that's good.
My fault?!  If you hadn't pushed me out of the window in the first place --
Don't talk to me about importance. Because of YOU the security of this entire universe is in jeopardy.
Buzz!  Buzz, come back!
No, no, no, wait, Buzz, Buzz, let's get in the back.  No one will see us there.
C'mon, c'mon, that's it...
Spaceship.
What happened to you?
Come on, this way!
Oh, come on, Buzz.  I...Buzz, I can't do this without you.  I need your help.
Oh, Buzz, you've had a big fall. You must not be thinking clearly.
Buzz!!  What are you doing?  I thought you were --
Woody!  It's the moving van.
Woody?!  What are you doing?
It doesn't matter how much we're played with.  What matters is that we're here for Andy when he needs us.  That's what we're made for. Right? Everyone is now looking down, sheepish.
It's not a laser!  It's a little lightbulb that blinks!
Let's string him up by his pull- string!
Hey!!
No she's NOT --
Where's my ear?  Who's seen my ear? Did you see my ear?
Oh, really?  I'm from Playskool.
Aa-a-a-a-ah! 
Who is it this time?
Good going, Slink!  Now, just, just tie it on to something!
Were you scared?  Tell me honestly.
C'mon, guys!  Every Christmas and birthday we go through this.
Hi ya, fellas.  To infinity and beyond!
Sargent.  Establish a recon post downstairs.  Code red.  You know what to do.
Come in, Mother Bird, this is Alpha Bravo.
Mission accomplished.  Well done, men.  Pack it up, we're going home.
Bad news?!
Woody?!
Woody!  Speed up!
He's a pyjama case, really.
I want to go home.
You're only a young thing.
The swan was so ridiculous. All the same, it did scare me.
Somebody couldn't wait until dark.
How long has -
I already lost everything once.
You're well built; how old are you?
I am on the board of my son's school. I had a fundraiser for A.L.V. in my front yard.  I have a right to know if my husband is a legitimate businessman.
Helena, please.  This is out of your hands.
Did you get it?
And you didn't feel like you could trust my wife with this news?
You had it all figured out.  You move into my house.  You raise my kids.  You sleep with my wife.  It was a good plan, Arnie.
Arnie, do think there's a difference between a reason and an excuse, because I don't think there is.
Like a Grateful Dead Concert.
Because I'm at the edge of my capabilities, Robert.
If you start in on the war metaphors I'm going to drive this car into a fucking telephone pole.
What is wrong with you?  What?  You're going away.  You're getting help somewhere.
Live with your parents?
Private?
What are you doing?
Yes, mom --
Did Courtney Love play Nancy in Syd and Nancy?
Move 'em to Texas, fry 'em up.
They're whispering.  I can't hear them, but I know it.  I smell conspiracy.  I feel the lie vibrating out of the home.
Are you getting this on tape?
What do we do?
What would a law firm want from the new drug Czar?
Arizona.
David --
You were followed by the police, but they won't hear us over the children. I want to use a bomb.
You planning on going somewhere, Eduardo?  You don't like it here? This is the best situation you're going to have for a long, long time.
Listen you motherfucker, you tried to kill me with a fucking cannon.
This is ridiculous.  Why is there no elevator?
You expect me to be grateful for spending the rest of my life looking over my shoulder.
Can't you for a second imagine none of this had happened?  That my drugs had gone through.  What would have been the harm?  A few people get high who are getting high anyway. Your partner is still alive.  We avoid having breakfast together. Don't you see this means nothing? That your whole life is pointless?
The worst thing about you, Monty, is you realize the futility of what you're doing and you do it anyway. I wish you could see how transparent you are.  This food tastes like shit.
My husband is the victim of an informer in your organization, not ours.
I don't think you're going to do that.
We have the ability to change the color, odor, and physical property of cocaine.
Take this back with you.  Deliver it safely to Tigrillo in San Diego and we have a deal.
Guzman, Tomas, Esteban --
Yeah.  It should be fun.  You wanna come?
So... maybe you tell me about your informants in our operations.
What's your name?
One question.  How did you find about this?
What is the name of your informant?
We ask questions and measure the answers.  When something doesn't ring true, a fact that doesn't make sense, a slight hesitation, then it's off to secondary for a closer look.  Before NAFTA we had about 1.9 million trucks a year.  Now it's almost double.  Pretty soon there'll be Mexican truck companies that will have as much freedom in crossing the border as American truck companies.
Who the fuck do you think you are? Where the fuck do you think you are? Why the fuck do you think I shouldn't just put you in a dumpster?
I got money.
I don't give a fuck about your parents --
You've been making very good progress against the Tijuana cartel.
I just want to be clear about one thing.  I used to work for him, but now I work for you.  I'm not a partisan person, I'm an issue person. In the next few weeks, if you allow me, we'll get you well-versed on an incredible array of issues.  The most important of which, in my opinion, being Mexico.  I know everybody that you're gonna meet. It's important that they like you. It's not important that they like me.  That's why I can help protect you.
Who are these guys?
He died in a liposuction surgery, right?
Who do we interface with on their side?
He's a research doctor.  You're dad's a doctor, too --
Well, why didn't you bring them?
Twenty thousand.
For fuck's sake.
It's a scandal, Franco.
I'm no a fucking buftie and that's the end of it.
What's your name?
Great.
You're too young.
It's so simple. We buy it at four grand, we punt it at twenty to this guy that Sick Boy knows, and he punts it at sixty. Everyone's happy, everyone's in profit. I put up two. I come away with six.
Happy birthday.
What happened?
Tommy knew he had the virus, like, but never knew he'd gone full-blown.
I bet Lizzy told him where to put it.
Strive, hope, believe and conquer.
Morning, Spud. Sit down and have some breakfast.
There's no need.
Are you getting out much?
Have you got any gear on you?
It's a tightrope, Spud, a fucking tightrope.
A little too well, if anything, a little too well, that's my only fear, compadre.
I chose not to choose life: I chose something else. And the reasons? There are no reasons. Who need reasons when you've got heroin?
Screenwriter?
It's certainly a phenomenon in all walks of life.
Eughh. Sounds horrible.
Did he -- you know?
Fuck you. OK, so Tommy's got the virus. Bad news, big deal. The gig goes on, or hadn't you noticed? Swanney fucks his leg up. Well, tough shit, but it could have been worse.
I can't believe you did that.
The Sick Boy method.
Excellent.
No, thank you. I'll proceed directly to the intravenous injection of hard drugs, please.
Sounds great, Swanney.
If I'm giving up a whole day and the price of a ticket, I'm just saying it had better be good. There's plenty of other things I could be doing.
There.
Six weeks!
Where did she come up with that?
Six weeks and no sex?
A walk.
Well, what are you waiting for?
Homeless people?
Qual se tu?
Why? Why have you done this to my friend?
The ship....
Bad news, gentlemen. Shore leave's been cancelled.
Don't tell them you're lost. You'll never live it down.
My visual says sunny skies and seventy degrees.
Um... yes. We've been caught in a blizzard!
Sulu, what are you doing?
In firing position. Torpedo armed.
What's Emergency Landing Plan B?
This is Captain Pavel Chekov speaking. You are in violation of Neutral Zone Treaty. I advise you to release your hostages at once or suffer the consequences.
You caught me on my way to the shower.
You told me you could have the ship operational  in two weeks. I gave you three. What Happened?
Spock - What are you doing in this neck of the woods?
"Pack Up Your Troubles."
Jim.
Spock, what is it? Do you know this Vulcan?
But he does seem familiar?
I do not often think of the past.
Spock.
You stay out of this!  Why, Spock? Why? I.. All you had to do was pull the trigger.
There is an emergency sending apparatus in the forward observation room.
I believe I have found a faster way.
Spock... the booster rockets.
Spock.
Spock?
Maybe he's not out there, Bones. Maybe he's right here... in the human heart  Spock?
Borgus Frat.
They can't be serious. The ship's in pieces and we've less than a skeleton aboard.
I am a Starfleet Officer.
Spock?
Sybok.
Sybok, we must find a way...
Dillinger?
Hi, Alan.
How's it going upstairs?
Beautiful!
That all you can say?
only yes and no...  You're a bit.
where's your program? Won't it miss you?
I think we'd better shut off all access till we can find that file. Just to be safe.
I've gotten 2,415 times smarter since then.
Ed, all I'm saying is - if our own people can't get access to their programs ... you know how frustrating it is, when you're working on a piece of research -
Oh, I know all that. Sometimes I wish I was back in that garage...
That was uncalled-for.
Well I want to communicate --
Who is your User, program?
Dumont!
How about over there...that empty memory?
Flynn!!
No big deal. I ought to know my way around that Light Cycles routine... I mean, I did write the program for it.
Then...
Hey... you guys OK?
Flynn, we've got to help him!
Hey, Ram ... what were you ... you know, before?
Yeah, yeah -- that's great.
Flynn! Look, Tron, he survived!
Don't even say that. You've got to find that file before he does..
Hey, you know anybody who wants to get hold of some video games... cheap?
Thank. you, Master Control.
You've got it. I've been hopin' you'd send me somebody with a little moxie ... what kind of program is he?
Well, I -- it's just -- I don't know, a User, I mean... Users wrote us. A User even wrote you...
But-what if I can't...?
You think we can make it there?
I can't believe how bad it's gotten around here since the MCP started taking over... all the good functions have shut down... everybody looks so dead... I'm afraid to even go out during down-time...
How?
Yes...it can take us across the Sea of Simulation... all the way out of the Game Grid...to the MCP.
We have to get off this beam!
Are you kidding?  Harry had to go out of town.
No you're not.  You're going to stay here until your father gets home and have cake!
Dinner's in the warmer.  Tell your father I may be late.
You seem fine now.
You'd tell me if there was something wrong, wouldn't you, pumpkin?
I seem to remember something about a history project that's due tomorrow.
Immediate roll.  Acquire subject at K Street and Key Bridge.					* Vehicle is red-and-white						* convertible.  You have six minutes.
They call him "The Sand Spider".				*
Harry?  HARRY?!
You better watch it.  She might file on you for sexual harassment.
It doesn't mean anything.  She buys antiquities for Khaled.
She's importing stuff from all over the mid-east.
So, you wanna play huh?  You little--
Ha!  The little prick ditched you!  That is so goddamn funny.
Nobody believes it can happen to them.
What're you talking about?  We have that.
Give me the page.
Goddamnit, Harry.  This is our butts.  So your life is in the toilet.  So your wife is banging a used car salesman.  Sure it's humiliating.  But be a man here--
I can get 3 Marine Corps Harriers here in about 12 minutes. They're on maneuvers out of Boca Chica.
Any minute now.
He's got it.
Is this a common thing for you? Cheating?
This is Persian, if I'm not mistaken.
Especially in this light.  This is the only light they had then,				* so I like to study it this way. I love this place.  I love all ruins.
You think I care about their					* cause?  Or yours?  Not at all.					* See, America is on top now .  .				* .  but so was Rome, once.  All					* civilizations crumble.  One nation succeeding over another. What does it mean in the long run?  The only important thing is to live well.  And...  living					* well takes money.							*
Hi, honey.  How was the flight?
I'm sorry.  Thank you for the party.
Come on to bed, you don't have to brush your teeth.
They said you had to run out.
How long have you been a member of his faction?
You weren't attracted to him at all?
Tell me about your husband, Mrs Tasker.
Would you say he was boring, then?
That's none of your goddamn business!  What kind of questions are these?
What do you think?  Of course yes!  What's involved?
Natasha?
Allison is sick in bed.  I have to go over there, honey.
Now slide the nylons off one by one.
What did he give you?
Is it working yet?
... you should have seen your father, standing there all covered with spaghetti sauce.  He looked like such a dope.
It's killer.  Look at me-- I'm not that much to look at.  No really.  I can be honest.  But I got 'em lining up, and not just skanks, either.  Some are.
What does she do?
To our assignment.
Helen, there's a double agent in my outfit... I don't know who. There's no one I can trust. Except you.  Can you get away? Just for two days.
Let me speak to Clarence.
You got that playing basketball?
Has he looked through it yet?
Thanks a lot.
Nothing. It's just you're a girl after my own heart.
I love to get pie after a movie.
Turn-offs?
Apparently, I was hit on the head with something really heavy, giving me a form of amnesia. When I came to, I didn't know who I was, where I was, or where I came from. Luckily, I had my driver's license or I wouldn't even know my name. I hoped it would tell me where I lived but it had a Tallahassee address on it, and I stopped somebody on the street and they told me I was in Detroit. So that was no help. But I did have some money on me, so I hopped in a cab until I saw somethin' that looked familiar. For some reason, and don't ask me why, that theater looked familiar. So I told him to stop and I got out.
What's that?
You mean she got a bad batch?
You're a whore?
You have a pimp?
Is he black?
Is he nice?
What did he do to Arlene?
Yes.
No no no no no no no no no...
So I can go over there and pick up your things.
I think what you did...
It's been fun thinking about the money but I can walk away from it, honey.
Nigger, get real. You touch Jayne Kennedy she'll have you ass in Wayne County so fast -
Ain't no man have to eat pussy!
What?
Look, Elvis, he is hauntin' me. He doesn't deserve to live. And I do want to kill him. But I don't wanna go to jail for the rest of my life.
All anybody saw was Clint Eastwood drinkin' coffee.
How do you think I'm doin' with Lee?
I'm not lyin' to him. I mean it. I loved "Coming Home in a Body Bag".
I'm a married man.
Alabama, could you tell Clar -
... formica. I did real well. I think she liked me.
This is Drexl's coke?
But you're an actor. I hear these Hollywood guys have it delivered to the set.
Shut up! First you come waltzing into my life after two years. You're married. You killed a guy.
I got the part on "T.J. Hooker".
Do you really mean it?
No. But thanks.
I grow it on my window-sill. The lights really great there and I'm up high enough so you can't see it from the street.
He wants to talk ya.
Apparently I'm not as dumb as you thought I am.
It tried to pin down what the attraction is after all these years. It covers the whole spectrum of fans, the people who love his music, the people who grew up with him, the artists he inspired - Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, and the fanatics, like these guys. I don't know about you, but they give me the creeps.
I don't know, Clarence, "Doctor Zhivago" is a pretty big movie.
Well, I have to admit, walkin' through the door and seein' these "Soldier of Fortune" poster boys made me a bit nervous. But, Lee, I'm fairly confident that you came here to do business, not to be a wise-guy. So, if you want, I'll put the gun on the table.
Now, that's practically uncut. You could, if you so desire, cut it a helluva lot more.
Why does he trust you?
Wanna count your money?
I can, but I don't.
I'm really not very -
Isn't she the sweetest goddamned girl you ever saw in your whole life? Is she a four alarm fire, or what?
Daddy. Nice isn't the word. Nice is an insult. She's a peach. That's the only word for it, she's a peach. She even tastes like a peach. You can tell I'm in love with her. You can tell by my face, can't ya? It's a dead giveaway. It's written all over it. Ya know what? She loves me back. Take a seat, Pop, we gotta talk -
Stop acting like an infant. You're here because you want me to help you in some way. What do you need from me? You need money?
Yes, I still have friends on the force.
If you don't hang around in this circle, no reason it should.
I've seen him.
I don't believe you.
You and Robin moved?
I'm me... I mean, that's me.
Well, the part you're reading for is one of the bad guys. There's Brian and Marty. Peter Breck's already been cast as Brian. And you're reading for the part of Marty. Now in this scene you're both in a car and Bill Shatner's hanging on the hood.  And what you're trying to do is get him off.  Whenever you're ready.
You got caught. It's all fun and fuckin' games till you get caught. But now we gotcha. OK, Mr. Elliot actor, you've just made the big time -
You're a fuckin' star! And you're gonna be playin' your little one-man show nightly for the next two fuckin' years for a captive audience -
Nigger, get outta my face with that bullshit.
Fuck! I knew it! I fucking knew it! I should have my head examined, driving like this!  Kandi, you gotta help me.
Just put it in your purse.
Please, they'll be here any minute. Just put it in your bra.
Yes.
We want you to tell us about last night.
Well?
Him?  You saw that man?
To be determined by the proper authorities.
They forced me to take drugs.
Let's consider again our current information -- if the symptoms were first detected in Philadelphia on June 28, 1995, that makes us know that...?
San Francisco, New Orleans, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, Kinshasa, Karachi, Bangkok, then Peking.
Mr. Cole?  My name is Doctor Railly. I'm a psychiatrist.  I work for the County -- I don't work for the police. My only concern is your well being -- do you understand that?
What kind of information?
Do you know why you're here, James.
Why not?  Most people have some ID.
A jail?  Prison?
Hiding?
What year do you think it is?
You think it's July of 1995?  That's the future, James.  Do you think you're living in the future?
Cole!  James Cole!  You escaped from a locked room six years ago.
I can't believe this is a coincidence, Mr. Cole.  Have you been...following me?
"Never cry wolf!"
You were very upset.  You're always very upset in the dream, but I never knew it was you before.
Look, I'm warning you.  You do anything, I'm going to go crazy -- hurt people!
See -- you can drive after all!
What made you think that?
It would be great if I'm crazy.  If I'm wrong about everything...the world will be okay.  I'll never have to live underground.
You were in my dream just now.  I didn't recognize you.
They may be looking for us, James.  Use this.  You can fix it in the Men's Room.
Who would you call, Mr. Cole, who would straighten everything out?
Germs?!
Of course not, I never thought you were. You want to escape, right?  That's very sane.  I can help you.  You want me to, don't you?  Get you out?
They hurt you!
Jo...Jose????
Uh, that message...me?
You "develop" viruses and you're calling me insane?  Typical.  What does this virus attack?  Don't tell me, you sick fuck, it doesn't matter.  Have I ever "developed" a virus?  Do I put helpless animals in cages and measure their reactions to electrical stimuli? Do I inject radioactive substances into living creatures and examine their bowel movements?  Wow!  And I'm crazy!
WHO CARES WHAT PSYCHIATRISTS WRITE ON WALLS?  You think I told her about the Army of the 12 Monkeys?  Impossible!  Know why, you pathetically ineffectual and pusillanimous "pretend-friend-to- animals"?!  I'll tell you why:  because when I had anything to do with her six years ago, there was no such thing -- I hadn't even thought of it yet!
You have him in restraints.
What?  What did you say?
That a fact?
Maybe one day I'll get to sit on a corner and spout wise.
Not this twig, friend.  I got plans.
I'll take a piece of that bet. I say it doesn't come up five times each side.
Nothing.
And what are you?  A rocket scientist?
We have a bus to Mexico.  Arrives in two hours.  Have to make a couple of connections, but it will get you across the border.
Twenty-seven, fifty.  That's all I got.
Then why do you call it Harlin's?
Well, you know so much why don't you just fix it yourself?
Somewhere else?  Mister somewhere else is fifty miles from here.  How you planning on getting it there? You gonna push this heap yourself?
Nothing.
To replace a God damn radiator hose!?
What's that got to do with the radiator hose?
No charge.
Yeah, but it was shot.
Well, now, you just know all there is about bein' a mechanic, don't you?  I can't do unauthorized work. I suppose I can just let you ride out of here with a bad gasket.  Then you get in an accident and get killed.  Or worse.  Who they gonna blame then?  They gonna blame me, and there goes my reputation.
No!
I don't want no dirty money.  I run an honest business.
That yours, Mrs. McKenna?
I put up new drapes, Jake.
You never said anything.  About the drapes.
They look nice.
What's the matter?
I don't hear anything.  You were dreaming.  Or maybe the wind blew something over.
Oh my God, Jake, no.  If it is someone they'll go away.  Or call the police.  Don't go out there.
Maybe I don't want you to.
No, I've got it.
Accident.
You just travel around, no direction, no steady work.  You must like taking chances.
What happens if you lose?
Nice place you got here.
You can let go of me now.  I'm safe.  How do they look.
I like them.  I was sick of looking at this room.  I think they add a little life.
You flirt with me, then you run cold.  You lead me on, then slap me down.  I don't go for being jerked around.
I don't know how.
It's not that easy.  Maybe you can take chances; maybe you can wander around like some stray wherever you please.  I can't.  I don't want to be alone.  I need to know I'm going to be taken care of.
Is it pretty?
He doesn't give it to us.  We take it.
What are you talking about?
I could if I had Jake's money.
If it isn't here, why would he wear that stupid key?
If you want.
You got a suitcase?
To get my car.
It doesn't matter.  He was there and he let it happen.  He can't take us in.
No.  I swear it.
Someone will find me.
I . . I was helping your wife.  I met her in town.  She needed a hand with her drapes.  That's all.
You've got to be--
I guess we've never been introduced proper.  Jake McKenna.
What brings you to Sierra?
Live there?
Hey!
I bet she led you on good, didn't she?  Taking you up to the house with that smile of hers.  Bet she wiggled her ass in your face more than once.  Then me busting in like some wild bear.  Bet you had a fire going under you.
I'm not a murderer, Mr. McKenna.
I'm surprised to see you.  I thought you'd be halfway to Vegas by now.
Nice office you've got.
You said you had an insurance policy out on your wife.  Fifty-thousand dollars.
I put it at fifty-thousand dollars, minus your cut, of course.  Which is?
Twenty-thousand?  I don't have that kind of money.  I won't get the insurance until months after she's dead.  I don't imagine you'll want to be around after poor Grace's demise.  Twenty-thousand; that's more money than I could ever get my hands on.
Don't say that.  I had a marriage of convenience with Grace, and look where that's lead.  Well, looks like we got ourselves a pact.
This is what you do:  Go to the house to see her.
I went to your place.  We talked, just like you told me.  We drove out into the desert . . .
You know what I mean.
You love her, but you hate her?
Shut up.
Maybe not this time, but somebody's going to get dead around you.
It's not like that.
Jake--
That's not the reason I'm here.  I swear it.
I'm curious about something.  I'm wondering just how it is you happen to know where the bedroom's at.
Is that what happened?  Did you even make it out to the desert, or did you just ply the afternoon between my sheets?
What are you babbling about?
You'd tell me anything to save your pathetic life.
I want to stay.
Hey, Mister.  You gotta quarter?
Got any requests?
You like Patsy Cline?  I just love her.  How come, I wonder, she don't put out no more new records.
Gee, that's sad.  Don't that make you sad?
That's what I thought until you came riding in.  I saw your car over at the gas station.  It's cool.  Want to take me for a ride?  Desert's kind of lonely this time of day.
Toby Tyler, it don't matter to me if you beat him all up and knock out all his teeth and he's just drooling and bleeding all over hisself, 'cause we love each other and we gonna run off, and I'm gonna have his love child.
I don't care what you believe as long as you leave me alone.
You're fucked.
Now, what's this?
Let me guess.  This robber; he gets your money.
Fucking kid.  And look at you; breaking fucking pencils.  You're a Neanderthal.
Kids.
Saw you at the truck stop this morning.  You're not from around here.
Just curious.  That's a nasty cut you've got.
You bitch!  You were in on it froom the start!
Got any cold soda?
Don't call me old man.  Ain't you got no respect, boy?
Hell no, I can't do that myself.  I'm blind.  Can't you see that?
What'd you think I was doing out here with these glasses on?  Sunnin' myself?
I think you'd better give your pooch a sip. He looks sick.
What the hell are you keeping a dead dog around for?
I think I've heard that before.
I thought you said you lost your eyes in the war?
Musta been some bad ass nuclear tests here in the 50's. This town's all inbreeding.
...But ain't you got a little something for the infirm?
Nothing makes the Great Spirit laugh harder than a man's plans. We all got plans. I planned on seeing all my life. I know you didn't plan on straying into town.
I don't care what you believe as long as you leave me alone.
Fine.  I was making time with your girl. Now I'm scared to death and I learned my lesson. Now can you go away?
Now who the hell are you, and it better be good, or God help me I'll break you in half.
A lot that means.
After you huffed off, Grace lied so bad, I got so pissed off, I pulled down her pants to paddle her ass raw and finger-fucked it instead. Sorry I lost my cool like that. It's a funny thing, women.
Say, what happened to your hand?
I guess we've never been introduced proper. Jake McKenna.
I'm a solid man.
I hope so.  Listen, McKenna about your wife:  If I had known she was married--
Wait a second--
She does at that.  I knew when I married her she was a free spirit.  A woman with her looks and a man my age; what was I to expect?  But you see a woman like that in a town like this and you don't think, you do. So, I married her.  What are you to do, eh? Women.
Sweet Grace?  What about her?
Don't play simple with me, Jake. You're a betting man. You want me to spell it out for you? I'll kill Grace if you cut me in on the money.
Well then, I guess that qualifies me for citizenship in this town. You're the one brought it up. This morning. In your car.
Bullshit.  You wanted me to kill her.
How much could you get?
That's my gun... That fucking Darrell!
I guess this is what they call "ironee"? Hunh?
You'd tell me anything to save your pathetic life.
Hey mister. Mister, I just... I just wanted to thank you.
Will he be back soon?
You own this place?
How much time?
Twenty-after-ten.
Accident.
Nothing.
A goddamn radiator hose in a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang.  You know how long it took me to find that hose?
It's going to cost you two-hundred dollars.
The goddamn sign on the wall. I can't do unauthorized work?  What am I suppose to do? Just let you ride out of here with a bad gasket.  Then you get in an accident and get killed.  Or worse.  Who they gonna blame then?  They gonna blame me, and there goes my reputation.
No! Okay! Okay!
Look, Harlin.
What you want?
What the hell ... oh, it's you.  Might've figgered. Listen I got a waitress coming over.  What do you want?
I call the sheriff.
Can I give you a hand, beautiful?
That's right on my way.
You don't have that dead look in your eyes like the only thing you live for is to get through the day.
You've been around.
Nice place.
My face tell you all that?
There.  All done.  Lift me down.
That's not an answer.  What is it you want?
Are there snakes out here?
Did you ever?
What's the matter?...Grace?
You mean the Shaman?
In <u>cash</u>?
I wanted to talk.
Except I can't get you out of my head, Grace. 
Why?  Am I making you hot, or does the truth scare you?
You know I thought you'd left me back there.
So, aren't you going to ask me?
I busted my leg!
Morning, officer.
The old lady?
Out of here.
Heineken?
You know how that Toby is.  Thinks every man he sees is after his Jenny.
Son of a bitch!
You fuck this guy -- get him to do your dirty work and you think you can take the money and dump me?
I put up new drapes, Jake.
You never said anything.  About the drapes.
Ya little bitch, you like it don't you! You like it this way -- rough and hard. Gotta go fuck around on me, like your Mama, but you always gotta come home to Daddy, don't you, cause you know Daddy's the best.
You been a bad girl, Grace. You took my heart from your Mama, didn't ya? You betrayed her! Like you did me. There ain't no forgivin' ya, girl!
Get out of the car, spread them. You can jawbone all you want or you have the right to <u>shut the fuck up</u>! You commie motherfucker. Either way you're goin' to the can.
I don't know. It's been a while.
Okay.
...I can't remember.
Is that what you wanted to ask me?
I'm not sure.
What's he talking about?
You forgot the "Now I'm going to tell you what the hell is going on" step. See usually that comes before the, "It's over" Step. And it always, always comes before the "You can go" Step.  What is over?
I don't know what you're asking?
Okay, I don't want to play this game anymore.
The guy might not have been carrying anything.
Stop messing with my life Elijah. My son almost shot me last night. He wanted to prove you were right.
Yeah?
I'm going to go in.
I'm going to work out.
You think you could beat up Mike Tyson? I mean before he started wiggin out and eating people's ears?
How many did you put on that time?
I'm not scared.
I'll just shoot him once.
He doesn't look very threatening.
Did you get up from your seat?
We're going to prevent any substantial atrophy of your good leg with this.  It works the quadriceps.
There have been three major disasters in this city over the last four years. I've followed each one of them... A Seven-three-seven crashes on take off. One hundred and seventy-two die. No survivors... A hotel fire downtown. Two hundred and eleven die. No survivors... And am Amtrak train derails seven and half miles outside of the city. One hundred and thirty one die. One survivor. He is unharmed.  I've spoken with your husband about his survival. I suggested a rather unbelievable explanation. Since then, I've come to believe, that my explanation, however unbelievable, is in fact, true.
He didn't say nothin', huh?
Free ones?
You're a beautiful woman an'... if I was to want a free one, I guess I'd want you more than them others. It ain't... See... I can't have no free one on account of my wife...
Charley, see what kind of "books" Mister Beauchamp is packing... but watch you don't get wet.
You leave me at the mercy of my enemies.
Damaged property. Like if I was to hamstring one of their cow ponies.
Hit your finger, huh?
You work for the railroads too, Mister Beauchamp?
Uh... I can assure you, Mister Daggett... the events described within are based... on the accounts of eye witnesses and...
Duke.
Them's the keys. All you gotta do is shoot me an' you an' English Bob can ride out free as birds.
I do not like assassins an' men of low character like your friend English Bob... but Bob ain't no coward who will cry to your face an' then...
What?
They... they killed him. I... thought you know that. I thought you knew because...
You're Pete Sothow's nephew, huh? Hell, I thought maybe you was someone come to kill me...  ...for somethin' I done in the old days.
Maybe I ain't.
She's passed on, Kid.
Don't tell nobody about the reward an' all. Don't need no other gunmen tryin' to collect.
Well, now Kid, there's two of these cowboys, ain't that so? Better there's three of us... maybe them cowboys got friends. Maybe...
An' how there was two deputies up close pointin' rifles at you... had you dead to rights... an' how you pulled out a pistol an' blew them both away to hell... an' only took a scratch yourself.  Uncle Pete told me he never seen nothin' like it, shootin' your way out of a scrape like that.
He ain't killed.
When we gonna double back?
Did... you... get... him?
Yeah, I guess so.
Say, Bill...
I trust you, Bill.
Wh-wh-who did you kill first?
You suppose maybe we're in somebody's field?
IS THAT YOU, KID?
Shit.
God damn it, Bill, it's rainin'.
No.
I seen him.
Who, Bill? Who got snake eyes?
I'm goin' on down to Kansas.
I'll bet anything he won't go to town nor he won't ride out on the range. Right off he'll hole up at the ranch.
Who's he?
Did you... did you... ?
I was only checkin' it for you. Thought maybe somethin' was bent.
Fuck you.
Say, Ned... ?
We're gonna need more food... at least three days worth...
Depends what he told you.  About Bill, you mean?
Keyser Soze
I'd say you've gotten on his main and central nerve, McManus.
Forget him. It's not important. I was trying to make a point.
Why don't you just calm down'
It's a logistical nightmare. Close quarters, no advance layout, ten men, maybe twenty.
I know you. You don't think I know you're on the take. This whole fucking precinct is dirty. You don't have a fucking leg to stand on.
What are we gonna do?
Me too.
Don't hurt me.
We'll make it.
Keaton, I can't just -
Ready?
Let's say for example -
What about Redfoot?
Listen to me, cocksucker. There is no Keyser Sate. If you say his name again, I'11 kill you right here.
I am sorry, Mr. McManus.  f implore you to believe me, Mr. Keaton. Mr. Soze is very real and very                             + determined.
We're on vacation.
When does he post bail?
I know what I wanted to know about Keaton.
I'11 find him.
A rumor is not a rumor that doesn't die.
I know you liked Keaton I know you think he was a good man.
Sure. Fifteen years ago, but he was a good thief Anyway, the cops wouldn't let him go legit.
You trying to get a rise out of me, Agent Kujan?
Oh come on, Verbal. Who do you think you're talking to? You really expect me to believe he retired? For a woman? Bullshit. He was using her.
I don't know about that.
You think I don't know you held out on the D.A.? What did you leave out of that testimony? I can be on the phone to Ruby Deemer in ten minutes.
I came clean. I told it like it happened on the boat. So what if I left out how I got there? It's got so many holes in it, the D.A. would've told me to blow amnesty out my ass. So you got what you wanted out of me. Big fucking deal.
Why did he want you to live? A one-time dirty cop without a loyalty in the world finds it in his heart to save a worthless rat-cripple? No, sir. Why'
If he's dead, Verbal - if what you say is true, then it won't matter. It was his idea to hit the Taxi Service in New York, wasn't it? Tell me the truth.
Where are you going to go, Verbal? You gonna run? Turn states evidence. You might never see trial. If somebody wants to get you, you know They'll get you out there.
Counselor, I will prosecute your client.
I'11 take my chances then. I'11 feel safer without a job if a man like Mr. Kint is behind bars.
You're joking.
Mr. Abraham...
Good.    You ever been inside a hospital?
Why did he go to see Mary Rooney?
He was accused of jury tampering.
So what I want to do is stop it here.  I'm going to make him an offer.  I want to do it myself.  I want it to come from me.
Nothing that we can do can make that woman well.
... he wants to testify ...?
You know what that would mean?  To get somebody from a Boston hospital to say he'll testify?
They want to settle.    It means a lot of money.
No, actually, she was referred to me.  She was Dr. Hagman's patient...
You were the anesthesiologist at her delivery May twelfth, nineteen seventy...
You were there to help Dr. Marx deliver her baby.  Were you not?
Anything special about the case?
We went to Code Blue...
Well, many reasons, actually...
And what did your team do...
Just now...
...the Archdiocese called up, they said who was our attorney, 'cause the case is coming to trial...
It's all right, Mickey.
I swear to you I wouldn't have turned the offer down unless I thought that I could win the case...
I am seventy-four years old.
I have some errands to run, and then I thought we'd spend the evening...
If she had eaten, say one hour prior to admission, the inducement of a general anaesthetic...the type you gave her... would have been negligent...?
They called, they're going to settle, what I want to do is build up as much ...
Yes.
Yes.
I can subpoena you, you know.  I can get you up there on the stand.
Who are you protecting, then?
That's it...?    Come on, guys...life is too short...  You tell me if you're playing 'chicken,' or you mean it.    Frank:  I don't think I'm talking out of school, but I just heard someone offer you two hundred grand...and that's a lot of money...and if I may say, you haven't got the best of records.
I had a witness disappear on me.
Do we have time this morning to... All right.  Mr. Galvin, you want to continue now, or we can resume with Dr. Thompson this afternoon.
I object, your Honor...
I'm sorry, Sir, we're not allowed...
I can't guarantee that...
Mr. Galvin's...
Hello, I'm calling from...
We find that your subscription lapsed...
D'you find an apartment?
Why?
Really.  How wonderful for you.
Maybe I can do something right.
That's not the question.  It's over.  Do you think that it's my fault?  If I'd...if I'd...I never should have taken it.  There was no way that I was going to win.
Thank you.
No, no, no.  I have to talk to him.  If I can only call him..
You need my help...?  You need a goddamn keeper...are you telling me that you turned down two-hundred- ten grand?    Huh...?  Are you nuts?  Eh?  Are you nuts. What are you going to do, bring her back to life?
To do what...?  To do what, for chrissake...?   To help her to do what?  She's dead...
You -- Listen:  you said to me, `if not now, when...'
We've got her sister.  Testifies she had a meal one hour before she was admitted to the hospital. This is the point.
Jimmy?  Bushmills.   Lookit, do me a favor.  I'll buy you a drink tomorrow.
What I'm saying, they're getting some help.
How are you holding up?
Okay.  What do you do when you don't have a witness?
That's right.
Are you with me...are you awake...?
Who?  They're all testifying. Everybody who was in the O.R.'s going to take the stand.
Uh...the admitting nurse...
She didn't do anything.  She took the patient's history and signed the charts.  'K.C.'  'Kathy Costello...'
What are you doing in New York...?
... I'm sure you do ...
... I understand ...
He saw her at the Northern Care...
We just can't do it anymore.   This is our chance to get away.
She told me.
Who told you that?
D'you ask the patient when did she last eat?
What did she say?
It's a long road that has no turning.
What happened in those three minutes...?
Franky can't make it.  He had an appointment he forgot, he's going to see you later.  I'm Mickey Morrissey, we're supposed to get to know each other.
...and he's making a billion dollars every minute working for Stearns, Harrington, and he bought a dog, and everything is rosy.   Then Mr. Stearns, he tried to fix a case.
How'd you get into the shipbuilding business, Gavin?
How long have you been back?
And you like it.
Like all this.
Would you like a drink now?
I'm afraid some harm may come to her.
Scottie, do you believe that someone out of the past, someone dead, can enter and take possession of a living being?
I want you.
You've done well, Scottie. You're good at your job.
Great-grandmother. The child who was taken from her whose loss drove Carlotta mad and to her death - was Madeleine's grandmother.
But she doesn't know, about her background.  She never heard of Carlotta Valdes.
How do you know all these things she doesn't know?
Why did she never tell her daughter?
Could I ask you a couple of questions?
My name is John Ferguson, and --
You.
I've heard that one before, too. I remind you of someone you used to be madly in love with, but she ditched you for another guy, and you've been carrying the torch ever since, and then you saw me and something clicked.  Huh!
Judy Barton.
About three years.
Listen, what is this? What do you want?
Will you have dinner with me?
Okay. Now we're going to buy you some clothes.
You don't even want to touch me.
The color of your hair...
Well?
We're going awfully far.
And I couldn't follow her.  God knows I tried.  One doesn't often get a second chance. I want to stop being haunted. You're my second chances, Judy.
You look like Madeleine, now. Go up the stairs.
Dead. He'd broken her neck.
Do you remember where you were?
When?
Please drink your coffee.
When you...  There were pins in my hair...
That's a good, strong name. Do your friends call you John? Or Jack.
I shall call you Mr. Ferguson.
I prefer John. There, that's done.  And what do you do, John?
One shouldn't live alone.
No, never before. I've fallen into lakes, out of rowboats, when I was a little girl. And I fell into a river, once, trying to leap from one stone to another. But I've never fallen into San Francisco Bay. Have you? Ever before?
Oh! Yes. Hello.
I don't know.
No, I Just thought I'd wander.
Don't you think it's sort of a waste for the two of us to...
Do you know where you're going?
When you jumped in the bay, you didn't know where you were. You guessed but you didn't know.
What do you remember?
What else?
What else?
I'm not mad. I'm not mad. And I don't want to die, but there's someone inside me, there's a somebody else, and she says I must die... Scottie, don't let me go!
Don't leave me... stay with me...
Where's your husband?
Go on.
You've been there before. You've seen it.
Yes.
My love... because I love you.
There are things I have to tell you, about how we met, and why we are together. But they can wait. The only important thing now is that I love you and I'm going to keep you safe.
Why?
Madeleine --
Yes, that's it. Sweet name, isn't it?  Foreign. But sweet.
Oh, it must be two weeks. Yes, the rent's due tomorrow.
It's this darned corset. It binds. He retrieves the stick.
You sound so disapproving, Midge.
I had to quit, Midge.
And sit behind a desk?  Chairborne?
It's brand new. Revolutionary uplift. No shoulder straps, no back straps, but does everything a brassiere should do. It works on the principle of the cantilever bridge.
Ah, sweet college days. But you're the one who blew it. I'm still available. Available Ferguson. Say, Midge, do you remember a guy at college named Gavin Elster?
Midge, what did you mean, there's no losing it?
Step number two.
Now, that's the kind of greeting a girl likes.  None of this "hello you look wonderful" stuff. Just a good straight "who do you know" --
Oh!  You mean Gay Old Bohemian Days of Gay Old San Francisco!  The juicy stories? Like who shot who in the Embarcadero August, 1879?
Pop Leibel.
For bringing you here. Come on, tell!
Here you are.
I did. Since when do you go about slipping notes under men's doors?
By her own hand.  There are many such stories.
Well, if it's absolutely necessary...
The stripper's here.
I'm not going to ruin my life over a dead whore.
I said how's it going?
No first of all. I'm not in a game mood.
You're an asshole Adam.
I was just playing...we were playing just playing around.
This is pathetic.
The hell I don't.
Go home!
Don't even start.
She's got no fucking pulse.
Just stop.
You don't just casually walk out of a Vegas Casino with a dead woman.
Have you completely lost your mind? So you get her out of here. So you get her out into the desert somehow, without anybody seeing, so what, you don't think at some point somebody might notice that she's gone?
Wait. Wait a minute.
So that's what we're doing.
She's Asian. They don't have Jews in Asia.
Don't talk to me about character.
I didn't do anything! I'll turn your pathetic ass in!
I'm talking about DNA samples, fiber optics, search parties, they got infrared scanners, FBI scientists. They figure this shit out. They always figure it out.
Honey, go in there and get some Starbursts.
Real times.
I tell mine that they're little men. I tell them they're strong. They make me feel joy. I let 'em know. So they really know that I need them just as much. You know. Just as much man. And you know, you're their godfather...
Either side you idiot. I'm calling 911.
So. When is the wedding.
What is it?
Yup.
That's right.
Is everything okay?
She's in there!
He's right.
I got her arm.
Tony? This is Keith Fisher. You're doing my wedding and I'm calling about the chair situation. Yeah, I'll hold.
Call 911.
All right people. New plan. Not even a new plan so much as a modification of the old plan.
That is a load of shit. Personal power has nothing to do with any of this. Tony Robbins has helped me to unlock energy and see my options more clearly, yes, but to give him credit for this, for all of this...Well that's just more than the man deserves.
What kind of words?
The problem was our quarterback had trouble remembering his right from left...
What?
After you drop the kids off, take Micheal home. Put a few drinks in him so he'll sleep.
This is a situation that defies judgement. We have acted and showed courage that is not of a kind known by most.
Blood money. Insurance dollars that you have thus fucking far decided not to tell me about at all. In no way have you mentioned that money. And I find that to be very very offensive.
The hell I did!
Take Mexico.
The need to know is clear. What did Adam tell Lois? That's the name of the game. What did Adam tell Lois? What does Lois know?
We're goosed.
Stop.
Come on tough guy. Listen to me.  You are going to tell Lois that it was all an accident. Okay cowboy? You got me?
Yea...It's great...seems like...I don't know you've got all the important stuff in there.
These rings represent the commitment Fisher and Liz make to each other on the day. Fisher do you take Liz to be your beloved wife, to respect, honor and cherish till death do you part?
Why can't we do it through the mail?
Photographer?
I'm working my ass off here. I've taken care of absolutely everything Keith.
I wouldn't know.
He's weird.
He just doesn't talk a lot.
You expect more what?
You go down there.
Do you love me?
Will you please call the chair people?
Yeah. Nesting.
This is our honeymoon.
Lois is a mess and Micheal's really upset. Everyone's upset.
Don't we already have someone to do that for us?
It's okay...It's okay baby. Cry for Mama. Cry for Mama.
What are you talking about?
Who's dead?
He kept saying he was protected.
But...
That's just insecurity.
No...No.
I have no idea.
Where's Boyd?
There.
That's a good one.
I think you'd make an excellent Big Brother.
Liz do you take Fisher to be your beloved husband, to respect, honor and cherish him till death do you part?
...regression of Modern Man to his most primitive, ape-like state...
Good times.
I'll come to you tonight.
Keep quiet. These miserable brats only get in the way.
Enedina and Paco ...
Which couch?
How did you know about that?
Never.
His mother wanted to keep him. She came from a poor family. I was in love with your aunt. I would like to have acknowledged him but I was afraid of losing her. That's why I didn't say anything.
I should like you to do something for me. It's an innocent sort of thing but I'm very set on it.
Uncle, you mustn't think that I won't be sad to leave you.
You're lying.
Sit down, I'm going to need your help.
Yes, yes, but there's no need to bring that up. How far are you prepared to help me?
It's for wheat. We've always grown maize in the strip above the vegetables.
What's the matter with you?
If you wake first, wake me up.
What are you thinking about?
Kill him.
I don't know; I can't remember. But I'm sure he loved you.
Miss Viridiana ...
I don't understand how you can like being alone so much.
What are you doing here? Get out.
Don't forget the meeting with the lawyer. The car will pick you up tomorrow morning.
They're varicose veins. It isn't leprosy.
You cannot leave ...
Don't invent stories; go to bed.
It's a very big one.
He came in through the cupboard.
I'll box your ears if you don't show some respect for the dead! You mustn't play under this tree.
But why does he want to see me? He has never bothered about me.
I have no desire to see the world again, but if you order me to...
She looks like a sick marrow!
Hello.
Good morning, Rita. How are we today?
I'm sorry, I thought you were somebody else.
This is the newest technology approved for general implementation. It's called a locater implant. Every parolee gets one.  We're going to know where you are every second for the rest of your life.
There's already a task force out looking for Lindenmeyer. Every other officer in the city will be hunting Sid right along with you.
What are they doing in Los Feliz?
Jesus Christ.  Can you kill it?
She's going to help you understand what makes Sid 6.7 tick.
This is the personnel file on the programmer, Lindenmeyer. There might be something in it you can use.
Officers in Toluca Lake just found an affluent couple...completely gutted.  So were the first two cops to arrive on scene.
Sid 6.7 is now armed.
She saved your life, Parker. She didn't have to, but she did.
None. He could be hiding, he could be helping Sid, or could be in little pieces on Santa Monica beach.  Any idea what Sid's going to do next?
Not if you're with him every step of the way.
Enough to level an entire city block.
You know how much man power you're talking about?
You've had a year-and-a-half to make all the adjustments you want, Lindenmeyer.  ) Elizabeth Deane does not give second chances. Neither do I. You're fired.
I haven't been working on anything.
Watching your VR people Auto Reset gave me the idea.
How should I know?
Should I have?
All they want to produce around here is mediocrity!
I am beautiful, aren't I?
A little less than yesterday.
Whoever did this wanted to do Charlie one better -- to improve upon what was already done.
Learn anything from Lindenmeyer's file?
I am impressed.
Lindenmeyer put increasingly complex combinations of criminal psychological profiles together to develop the ultimate villain.
This is getting you pumped up, isn't it? This is like the World Series to you.
She's beautiful, you know?
What did you do to those people?
Which way?
Parker -- stop! STOP! Don't make me shoot you--
More or less.
You and me have nothing in common.
I wouldn't pull the trigger if I were you--
You can't die until you tell me where the C-4 is. Where is it?!
Now, is that any way to talk to an old friend?
It's the White House.
No, this is great.
Ames here.  <u>Yessir</u>... 
NY Times, Washington Post, War, War, War.  Times got the girlscout page twelve, Post in Section Two.... Horses in Mid-Stream...?
Hey, hey, I'm just the Producer, I'm just the <u>Stationmaster</u>, Johnny Green wrote that song, and...
...where?
We are virtually certain it isn't...
We're going to have to explain away the...
It won't hold.
Twenty thousand dollars.
Tell, tell, tell me again.
We can't <u>afford</u> a war.
<u>Who</u>?
We'll be back tonight.
New York Times, Wash Post, Detroit Register, San Diego BEE, all in emission.  <u>No</u> mention of the Girlscout. None.
Speaking of thanks... we puttem back in, what does your fellow Moss want?
...I just missed my plane.
He thinks it's too...
Ronnie says we don't need'em for another four days.  ...s'there a problem?
How's your wife?
Pride of a job-well-done...
"...where's my pill..."
OVER A SLEEPING BREAN, STRETCHED OUT ON A POOLCHAIR, GRACE, THE SECRETARY, COMES OUT ON TO THE POOL AREA, HOLDING THE SHOT OF A SMALL, FOREIGN LOOKING CHILD, IN FRONT OF A PILE OF RUBBLE. SHE SHOWS IT TO MOSS.
Would somebody wake me in five minutes?
Well, c'n we get him back home?
My name is Ronald Brean.
What's on your mind?
Why do people go to war?
It can be documented that he displayed the...
But there isn't a B-2 bomber.
And you're here <u>why</u>...?
What one has to do, Mr. Moss.  Is to fight a holding action.
What do you want the kid to say?
I'm a Jew in Show Business.  Why come to me?
Who?
"They Got To Know?"  <u>Stan</u>...?  Get with it.  Who Killed Kennedy...?  I read the first draft of the Warren Report, said he was killed by a Drunk <u>Driver</u>.  You watched the Gulf War.  What did you see?  Day after day, the one "Smart Bomb" falling into a building. The <u>truth</u>, I was in the building when they <u>shot</u> that shot, they shot it in a studio, Falls Church Virginia, 1/10th scale model of a building.
How the fuck do <u>we</u> know.  You take my point?
You know, you're a <u>writer</u>, that's your script.  You're a <u>director</u>...  But if you're the <u>producer</u> ... what did you do?  What did you do?  All you've got is the <u>credit</u>...  Some plaque on the wall...
Hell, I'd just do it for the <u>hell</u> of having <u>done</u> it, for a story to tell...
...Yoha, Yoha... Yoha.  <i>Why</i> Albania?
...this the Guy.
Where is he now?
What's the thing with Morse Code...
My prop guy, had a guy out here.
What?
Hey, our job ends at the Finish Line.
If they can give Kissenger the Peace Prize, I wouldn't be surprised to wake up and find I'd won the Preakness.
Inaugural Speech, press corp's gonna be jealous of giving up that one...
Yeah, we'll gettem in their cars.  I'm slowing down...  No, no.  Look, lookit:  I think it's a mistake, well, I'll <u>tell</u> you why:  you got'em by the balls, <u>Squeeze</u>.  Because Schumann's the Shark.  He's ...<u>Jaws</u>.  You have to <u>tease</u>'em... You don't puttem in the first reel of the movie...  Bring'em back <u>slow</u>, the President...  No, no, put him on.  Put him on.  President wants to reveal Scbumann before the election.
I thought they weren't meeting him at the airport...
He's fine, as long as he gets his medication.
Just....do what I ...look:  get me a ...hello...? Hel...?  I'm going to need an <u>ambulance</u>, we take him, the last moment, right from the Pl...no, <u>we</u> land, we puttem <u>in</u> the ambulance.  Air force jet lands, we take somebody <u>else</u> off <u>that</u> jet...what the fuck do <u>I</u> care? Somebody in a Hospital gown.  And we need a ......hello?  Hello...?
He's going to be fine, aren't you boy...?
An anti-psychotic...
Wake up.
We have no home.  We're vagrants.  N'each man's hand's against us.  We killed Old Shoe...  We killed the Schuster...spend our life in a packingcrate...Where are you <u>going</u>...?
William Schuman.  Old Shoe.  U.S. Army.  Serial number, 21-31-2841-262.
Hold it a minute, Benny, willya?
Bunny:  I had an idea:  a Slinky, that falls <u>Up</u>...  Naa, we can figure that <u>out</u>.  What I'm wondering:  what do we <u>call</u> it...  You got my number... 
...what do you got?
All part of the Service we Render.
What would be true, then.
...as of today, 89% favorable.
...by you?
And one of them is in love with the <u>sister</u> of...
...mmm.
Oh, hell...
Lemme talk to him.  Will?  Shoe?
a "pond," or
Look Harold, they're vulnerable, alright, but we don't want 'em to think they're under accumulation. Go slow. Call Geneva and the Bahamas for me, will ya? We feint towards it but we wait...
Gordon, the insurance people are balking on the logging trucks...
Who the hell's out there? What are the arbs saying? It's gotta be a big hitter.
... That's what you told us to say.
Nice piece of work, Fox. Why don't you join me and the partners for lunch tomorrow in the dining room?
I gotta feeling we're going to make a killing today, Marv.
... looks like you grown another inch... but you don't look so hot, getting bags under your eyes, starting to look old like me.
I told you not to go into that racket. You could've been a doctor or a lawyer,
I don't get it, you get a scholarship to NYU, you get 35,000 the first year, and 50 last year, where the hell is it?
It's yourself you've got to be proud of, Huckleberry, how much ya need?
...Got a 100 on me, you...
... it adds up Buddy, 300 here, 200 there. Your brother never...  ...well, I always said money is something you need in case you don't die tomorrow...
That's great Dad.
What brings you out here...
Problem with money is you never have enough or you got too much -- and when you got it you're never happy 'cause somebody's always trying to take it away from you. Money's one giant pain in the ass y'ask me... thanks.
Yeah, you do that huckleberry. I'll still be here.
Dad, I'm going to jail and you know it.
...thanks Natalie.
I told him I was in the bathroom and I'd call him right back. What the hell was I supposed to say Buddy, you got me into...
I don't know anything!
Come on Buddy, you wouldn't want to got me disbarred now would you?
More money than you ever dreamed, Roger. And the thing is no one gets hurt...how bout a beer?
So what's the problem?
...A cosmetics company by any chance? What are you, the 12th man on the deal team? The last to know?
How do you know?
...for my kid Rudy -- 3 years old, electronics freak, got a liquid crystal display 'stead of an electronic beam. We're going into a new age pal. So how's business today.
Mr. Gekko -- thank you for the chance. You won't regret this, you're with a winner.
...come on sport, you gotta try harder, I need some exercise for chrissake...
I guess your father's not a union representative on that company.
Sir Larry Wildman. Like all Brits he thinks he was born with a better pot to piss in... bribed an old secretary of mine to open bar mouth and stole RDL Pharmaceuticals right out from under me. Wildman the white knight.
Money never sleeps pal. When I came in in '69, they traded six hours a day, now the clock don't stop, London's deregulated, the Orient is hungrier than us. Just let the money circle the world, sport, buying and selling, and if you're smart it comes back paying. I just made $800,000 in Hong Kong gold. It's been wired to you -- play with it. You done good, but you gotta keep doing good. I showed you how the game works, now school's out.
You don't understand. I want to be surprised...astonish me, sport, new info, don't care where or how you get it, just get it... My wife tells me you put a move on Darien. Here's some inside info for you. That Euroflash GQ guy she's going with's got big bucks but he's putting her feet to sleep. Exit visas are imminent. So don't lose your place in line.  Oh, jeez, I wish you could see this. The lights coming up over the water. I've never seen a painting that captures the beauty of the ocean at this moment.  ...an old Russian proverb - "a fisherman always sees another fisherman from afar." I like you sport, I ever tell you that... Gordon, call me Gordon from now on.
The art of which is deception. Spread the buy orders through different accounts and you won't get burned...
Mixed emotions, Buddy: like Larry Wildman going off a cliff in my new Maserati. Men as smart as myself have got their asses handed to them on a sling with the airlines, fuel could go up, unions are killers...
Gordon what I want--and I never asked you for anything--is to be your co-pilot on this. I want to take this airline, turn it around, and make it work. It's gonna make us a fortune!
Gordon, I worked at Bluestar, I know my way around, I have friends there...inside.
Now, wait a minute, Dad...
Gordon, it's two minutes to close. What do you want to do?! Decide.
Destiny took us apart, but I knew it would bring us back together.
I don't.
Let's get things straight, Bud. I'm not going to take a cut. I worked hard and you can't decorate a room in New York for less than $100,000. Curtains alone...
Sure, why not, money's the sex of the 80's. I never had it like you when I was growing up, baby, it wasn't the upper east side.
You may not believe this Bud but I really do care for you. I think we could've made a good team...but that's how it goes...
Morning Buddy, you look happy.
You got a look in your eye, Mr. Mannheim... You got something for the small fry...
Sleep with me and the secrets of the West are yours.
Mr. Mannheim, got a sure thing.  Anacott Steel.
You're on a roll kiddo. Enjoy it while it lasts -- 'cause it never does.
I thought this was an informal meeting. What's he doing here?
Frankly, Carl, I can't see giving much more. If you have any suggestions I'll be glad to listen.
I want to ask you a big favor, Gordon. Please drop the Bluestar deal.
I can't...and I won't.
You must be wearing a mask you're laughing so hard behind it Larry. Let's cut the "sir" crap. Correct me if I'm wrong, but when you took CNX Electronics, you laid off 8,000 workers, Jessmon Fruit about 6,000, that airline...
He did?
Anybody want another drink?
Us is over.  You had your chance you blew it.
Oh Mark.  It's ok.  It's ok.
Would you like a closer look?
Your books Master Loftmore
Will you be wanting your wheels today sir?
Jenkins.  Can I get you some help?
No Mark. MARK Why not?
Ok, so maybe I was a little over emotional.
You aren't sick! We've got to get back.  What are you doing!
You bet.  We all can't be such modern people 
Do you have a scarf?
I know that.
That was very good.
Besides, Dad would have freaked.
I miss you.
Did you?
I didn't want to come.
What's happening to me?
No.
I felt...pain.  That she'd been hurt by someone.  This is great.  I'm trying to intuit the emotions of a figment of my--
How're you holding up?
Toward the end.  You remember?
Well, I'm glad.  Pardon my intrusiveness, but we do have to stick together you know.
When...when will she be back?
Tell me.  Please.
Oh God.  He's back.  I'm sorry.  Please forget that I...I don't know what I'm saying.  Please...
Would you like some iced tea?
Love.
Have you ever felt so completely consumed by a feeling for someone that you couldn't breathe?  That the time together is so passionate and consuming that you felt physical pain when they would leave?
Mrs. Frank?
Full scholarships.  Princeton too.  She wanted to stay close.
Absolutely.
In the window.  Norman's at work.
I'm sorry for leaving, but I mean, Jesus, Claire...
Then what was it?
I started to walk over...but he wasn't alone.  A blond.  I only caught a glimpse. She was young.  I should have said something right away. But I didn't.
Partly because I didn't want to hurt you...but partly...partly because I was relieved.
I'm a terrible friend.
I don't know.
Jody, she tried to kill him.
Alight, alright.  Stay calm.  You opened this door.  There's got to be a way that you can close it.
But he acted like he'd never heard of it.
I guess not.
Christ, that's twice in...When did they move in?
When's she out of here?
It's today?
To tell you the truth...I'm excited.
It's just us now.
Wanna fool around?
Maybe we should just...
Claire...
Claire?
What are you doing here?
Did you call the police?
It was there.  This angry music all by itself.  And I heard whispering.
I've got the conference next week.  I want you to feel safe.
Yep.
"...of Perpetual Distances."  Everybody's checking their shoelaces. Pins drop.  "I'm afraid you've mistaken me,"  I say...
Didn't know he was dead, every stinking paper on the globe.
Sorry.  You understand.
Get down!  He'll see.
He did.  She's in the picture.  I went over to look and she's gone.  The table was set for one.
See?
When?
When you do this, I swear...
I never said...
Sabotage?
The accident...?
Keep your voice down.
Do I have everything?
What?
You were lost in the music...eyes closed...your chest heaving...
You dropped a glass.
A cheap wine glass from the caterers.  You started crying.  I tried to comfort you...
It was maybe a week after the accident. We were moving.  It was a hard time.
I may have seen her on campus.
I thought it was Mrs. Feur, but it's not...
I never asked you to quit!
She was damaged and unstable.  The more I tried to distance myself, the more desperate she became.  Finally, she showed up at the new house...
Do you know it?
What's that for?
I know.
I don't believe you.
Thank you for this honor, my dear.
With his hands!
Jesus I've got - to get to the ho--
How do you know about Rowan ...?  I didn't --- Cemetery...?
I'll probably be back in a week...but I can't spend Christmas in that house.   you'll check on her - every day...?
My...mother...?
-Ellie said she died when I was BORN!  She's been alive...? ALL THIS TIME...? Why have I been lied to when -
What's the matter with you...?! What kind of person are you...?!
You came.    I'm your Aunt Carlotta, my dear.
Eighty million doll --- ?
You kept her in this filth in restraints...?.
Lasher touched you and you loved it.
Did you like it...? Looking down at Graham and knowing what you could do...?
Mum...  Oh Mum, God will surely strike us -
Michael...  Do what you can.
YOU VIOLATED ME!!!  ON MY WEDDING NIGHT!
What is wrong...?
No!
The portraits, Lasher.  Why are the witches always before a door...? Tell me, Lasher.  Now!
Oh god...
I'll destroy you.  I swear it!  If you don't kill me, I'll find a -
Harder...
I was born, in New Orleans, too-
Doctor's orders- - -?
Stop it.
Rowan...?
Go to LAX and get on a flight to New Orleans.  Go to the Ponchartrain Hotel and wait for me.  I'll call you there.
It could've been a tornado - or a - a hurricane.  Maybe -
Ro - you can't really believe that. Nobody can murder someone with their feelings.  I mean --- that's CRAZY.
Stop looking at me like that! I'm not some siren chanting to the moon.  And my life is not a cosmic whim!  I am in charge of my life -  - and I want to stay.  Everything that was taken from me is here, Michael. All these years, she was there without me.  Helpless. I should have been here.
It'd take mounths... and cost a fortune.
I'll bet she had a wonderful smile.
Everyone - this is Michael curry.
Either do I.    I love you, Ro.  You know that. You're a total mystery to me - but I love YOU. 
You're just afraid I'll drop dead before I finish the damn house.
I took off my gloves today - with Aaron -  - and it was okay.
Aren't we supposed to love somebody for their moral rectitude or their courage or their beneficence -
Wanna snack...?
Hey - you're bleeding.
I - I...  I can't, Michael.  There's stuff --- at the clinic -
You've gone away from me, Ro...  Someplace I don't know how to get to.
sooner Or later you're gonna run out of things to change.  You always do.
On which planet...?
You okay...?
A few hours and I'll be wasting away in Margaritaville.  Oh, sweet decadance.
We'd better get to work on the papers.
I've got a tenant coming over later - can I take the afternoon off?
That's not technically accurate - SIMPSONS murders weren't sexually motivated.
Sounds good - thank you
That's very kind of you MR GRIFFITHS...?
Tell me BRIAN, what would happen if the client lost the key?
All the time?
What's with all the locks - and hammering
If you want any - there's some left in the kitchen
Oh anywhere - whenever I needed to - Do you know how easy it is to take them? You just pick up a hiker, or someone off the streets - they believe so easily you know, 'Look, I have something to show you' I would say - and that would be it. One girl, I think her name is Debbie - she had broken down on the motorway, and I offered to take her to a service station to call for a tow truck - She just got in and I drove away. When I pulled into the layby and took out my knife - she just froze, and said - what do you want? - I said, You know what I want. - But she didn't. Getting rid of the bodies is just as easy - the first I cut up, put in bags with bricks in, and tossed them off Eldridge Bridge in broad daylight.  The real problem with my work is the blood - there is so much of it - and it all spurts out so fast - like a fountain. It made such a mess of
The press think that the WHITE ANGEL is a woman - why is that? Do you dress up LESLIE?
What didn't you like about her?
No...I didn't do it...I wish I had but I didn't. I was beaten to it. STEPHANIE became my mother.
What?
Psychiatrists would say that you are confronting your demons
Where are you going?
I thought we had a relationship built on trust - and you just slap me in the face...
LESLIE?  Is that good enough?
ELLEN, would you like a cup - there's plenty in the pot
Why did you let him in?
whats wrong...what have I done wrong?
I don't want either of us to come to any harm - please...
Don't you want me now LESLIE
Yes - but you live here too - If it were your house?
You don't own him you know - you can't tell me not to see him!
It's been what, three years?
Her husband left her
Sugar?
See? Did you see that?
Seriously, it's like we're being reborn. We really could reinvent ourselves here, just like you said. Nobody knows about your massive humiliation.
I can't believe that's your mother. We're talking babe-a-licious chub fest, right here in the 501's.
Oh. Well. Maybe not yet.
So far away? In Xenia?
Our plane crashed. In the Grand Canyon. A big fiery explosion. We never made it to L.A. They needed dental records to identify us. And this place. This. Actually. Is. Heaven.
You're late, bro!
I feel like I've just been hit by a Mack truck.
Holy stinkers, what were you thinking?
You got everything you ever wanted.
We don't generally feature blow-up dolls in our magazine. But hey, if you think there's a market for it.
Wouldn't it be awesome if we were about to say the exact same thing?
I have to admit, I am so totally turned on. We should do it. Now.
We think you should give up the magazine. Sell it. Let someone else run it. Whatever it takes.
You're way ahead of me again?
Ted, it's your dad.  I have a question for you.  I don't know how to put it tactfully. You know I'm lousy with words.
I paid off the mortgage! I ordered that Winnebago you always wanted! Now you're ashamed of me?
You do know how to drive?
The first time can be awkward. You just have to get on and try again.
I'm Ted, by the way. I think I forgot to say that.
Who exactly ARE you?
After graduation...maybe we could go away together?
Ted! Do something!
This is humiliating. We're being ejected from a prom!
Well?
But don't worry...we'll be in heaven. The REAL heaven, I mean. Not that heaven is an actual place, but more like a state of being. Or not being. Who knows. Maybe we know now.
But we did want you. It's just that you don't always get to keep what you want. We knew you needed a real mom and dad.
I'm no stranger to the notion of philanthropy. Andrew Carnegie has long been one of my idols.
Matter of fact, Jay, my uncle and I are planning to rethink the magazine. To expand the traditional western notions of "beauty."
Sheryl Petersen is, what, nine years old, what does she know?
They say money can't buy happiness but this is a reasonably good facsimile.
I came to ask permission to take custody of your room.
If you could just sign right there.
Are they okay?
A few billion bucks and suddenly he's Cro-Magnon Man of the Year.
What do you want from me? I'm trying to be fair. But I can't keep you on staff if you turn every PTA meeting into an Agent Orange cover up.
I have to admit, I always felt... different.
See? You're impertinent, rude, sarcastic.
That's probably my office.
I don't know. This place seems pretty tame.
That has more to do with your proximity to me.
Shoes, if you want to know the truth. Shoes are my thing.
Tell me more.
You think you're working with chimps here?
Planet Ted. Five years from now. What's happening?
I know where you can find an excellent editor-in-chief.
What is this? Does everybody know everything I'm about to say or do every freakin' minute of the day?
That's part of growing up, honey.
What about Charlie?  You boys could make it a little adventure.
Well? Surprised?
You promise you'll finish school?
You don't have to work another day in your lives.
What kind of sick question is that? I'll be watching you, young man. Your money and power mean nothing here. Nothing.
I'm warning you.
You kicked us off your turf, Merk. Don't rain on our parade.
You're the Sultan of Semen. The Monarch of Masturbation. The Merchant Prince of Lust. You. Ted. Are the King of Coitus.
I never finished school myself. Never had to. My brother built this empire from nothing but his wife's perky tits and a whole lot of gumption. He gave me a cushy job on a silver platter. I never struggled for a second.
At our press conference tomorrow, I think we should announce our plans to explore the world. Not just a few leggy 36D's, with blond hair upstairs and down.
Don't forget to tell them all your qualifications.
I never saw anybody turn so many shades of red.
Yes?
What are you doing?
Bad news.
My parents? What do you mean?
How quaint.
Are you familiar with "Heaven?"
Talk to me Artie.
Could be hers.  Types match.  Could be a lot of other people's too...
The next thing... his hand was in my shorts... you know, from behind.  His fingers... his fingers...
He said something like, "Do you want it dirty7" or something.  I tried to turn away, but he pushed me to the floor.
No.  I've done it a couple of times, I mean with guys I dated.  But this hurt... like, he was built... you know...
Did you try to fight him?
Then what?
Try, Kelly.
If old pictures interest you, come back some time, there's quite a collection down in the pagoda.  I'll see you get a proper tour.
And when you turned her toward the door, where did you expect her to go, without a car?
Isn't that against the law, peeking into windows?
It's our job, Gloria.
That's what they called it when I was in Juvenile.  It's a pretty dismal place.
We all have...
He's leaving the country.  And I don't give a shit.
You didn't tell me you were gonna put me on the fucking news.
Yeah.
I want a full-scale investigation.
Oh, Ray... no...
She bit you?
You know, I want to thank you for getting me into this class...  No way was my old man going to spring for the fees...
It's those rocks, up there.
Yeah, sometimes.  Lots of the kids hang out here.  You really think something bad happened to Suzie?
I say something funny?
You are.
What are you looking at?
Is there some reason why you're here?
Excuse me?
Get off my property.
Which one of your "bodyguards" is that?
Okay, try me on Sunday.  I'm going out to the Everglades on Saturday.  You guys can wash the mud off.
From now on, if we're seen together, it's got to be accidental.  I thought that was understood...
We have to stick with the plan.
Kelly.  Is Suzie there?
Shit.  I was afraid of that.  She left this garbled message on my machine.  Can you calm her down?
No!  Christ.  Listen, Kelly, I'm counting on you.  You calm her down. I mean do whatever you have to, whatever it takes...
I don't know... I think it was something else... Suzie says the bust was bullshit...
That never seemed to worry you at the Glades.
Nellie Gail Ranch...
I'm placing your daughter under arrest.
It doesn't look like it.
You, Kelly, Sam.
Like I said, I hadn't really expected to use it.  Anyway, I'm going through a drawer.  I hear a car.  I look out the window.  I see Nicole driving away.  I leave my room, and there's Kelly.
Yes.
You mean this thing?
I thought this was supposed to be a vacation.  Why didn't you buy a nice big power boat?
I was worried about you, Suzie.  I decided we should all get together, one more time, before we split up.
That was about as grim as it gets.
What?
I've seen you out there in your old air boat, thinking about what might have been, old man Van Ryan hadn't fucked you out of it.  What if I told you I had a way we could get a big piece of it back?
How...
Sorry, Sandy.  I've got plans.
Congratulations.  Unfortunately, my train is about to leave, and I really must insist you disembark.
Attractive buttons, yes?  But yank one off, toss it, and poof!  It emits a cloud of sleeping gas.
That should put us ahead of the criminals.
Aha!
Doyle, once around the park.  I need a moment to prepare.
Doctor V. L. Pemberton.  I knew it.  He's a scientist all right. Inventor of the Pemberton Condensed Steam Engine.  I'm telling you, Artemus, Loveless is our man.
All right.  How about this?  We put a watch on this Pemberton, somebody tries to grab him...
At least I tried something.
Well... that, too.
Willard...
So the idea is if a guy punches me, he really hurts his hand?
Excellent detective work, sir.  You should have the honor of going first.
We've got to stop him right here, now!  With that armored steam engine of his it'll be a slaughter.
Time for you to get off, Ma'am.
A new friend?
Anyone?
Well, where I come from it kind of goes with the territory.  Texas.
Well, sir, you are proving to be one of my more interesting guests.
Oh, don't worry.  I've already overlooked the fact your name's not actually on our guest list.
You must excuse the Doctor.  No one has ever beaten him at his little game.
Look, I'm Captain James West...
... well, of course you can.  Mr. President, what a surprise.  What brings you here?
Why don't we just cut this routine short?  Whatever you do to us, we're not going to talk.
You got that right.  Now get up. We're walking out of here.
I only met him once, but that was enough.  For such a little man he had quite an oversized opinion of himself.  He offered me the "rare and unparalleled opportunity" to develop a new steam engine for him.  He claims to have some sort of factory in Texas, I believe. Said I could have the run of the place.  He had all sorts of specifications.  But when I questioned him closely, it became obvious he was just another mercenary businessman.  Both he and his partner had no real love of steam.  It's sad.  So few men do.
This is something.
I beg your pardon?
Well?
Hey...!
Madmartigan!  What did you do this time?
I always knew you'd end up in a crow's cage.
You left me to die, friend.
It's you they're after, Madmarti- gan.  What did you do this time?
You mean, you know who this baby belongs to?
No, Willow.  Your journey has just begun.  It has been foretold that this child shall bring about the downfall of Queen Bavmorda, whose evil powers have darkened our world.  Upon you depends this princess's life.
You are the guardian, Willow.  You must take her to Tir Asleen.
Why can't you do it?  You have mag- ical powers.
You!  Are you the mother of that child?
Mmmm, I love the smell of a woman.
Sorsha.
Do any other daikinis ever come by here?
You all right?
I'll be around long after you're dead, Airk!  You slime!  When I get outa here I'll cut your head off and stick it on a pig-pole!
Fresh goat's milk.
Here are her diaper rags.  And this is her milk bladder.  And when she cries--she's either hungry or she's tired--rock her on your left shoulder.  She likes that.
So you're on your way to Tir Asleen, huh?  I hate to tell you this, Willow, but Tir Asleen dosn't exist.
Willow...this may be a bad time to ask this question but...what if Raziel's wrong?
It's not a Nelwyn baby.
Dada, what's a daikini?
I could be you rguard!  I could carry your spear!
Your will!  Your will!  What else could it be?
Oooh, this smells terrible.
I just wanted to test it first.
Watch this.  Right between the eyes.
I'm not going in there.
We gotta follow them.
She's hungry.
She requests the presence of your- self and the young princess.
Talk!  Say something!
Hey, careful there!
Didn't you hear me, Book? Pull! You never had your hands on a teat before?
How could you do this to me tonight? I told you I had company
You've got a man here and the kids are upstairs?
Put my car in the garage and close the door.
Eli says you're a carpenter, Book.
Your hole is healed, then?
Nail it!
Everything is all right, John.
Who'd you see, Sam? The man on the floor?
That's Luke. He doesn't like strangers.
Is it them?
What have you got?
So one of them got to him.
That's the problem. We need results. The press is driving us crazy over this P2P thing. Calling us the 'speed capitol of the country'. You know the sort of thing. It's getting political. The Commissioner's getting very uneasy.
When word gets out that Zenovitch was a cop, all hell will break lose. You've got 24 hours. That's all I can give you. 24 hours on your own. After that the case and the witness go back to the Homicide Department.
What's-her-name moved to Buffalo.
Last guy I would have figured. But he's part of it.
What's your first move?
You made a mistake, Paul. You shouldn't have taken Elton out.
I'm fine. I'm going to live a long time. That's what I called to tell you.
You might want to pass it along to Mac.
Look, I'm genuinely sorry...
Why don't you arrest that man? Are you protecting him because policeman?
But why would they murder...
What else can you do?
Whacking is not of much use on a farm.
Won him over just like that.
You should not bother with that birdhouse.  If you're leaving tomorrow.
You're so sure of that?
There is always a way! But you are such a... a Glotzkopp you cannot see! You'd rather go back to that city! To nothing! No woman! No children! No land!
I got there late, John.
Yeah... I can put it all together when I get back, 'Til then, you know nothing, understand? Business as usual...
You hear me?
Where I'm at is maybe 1890.
You'd lie to protect him.
You're the first one he'll contact.
Elaine, I've come to apologize for Lt. McElroy. He overstated the department's position.
God, Fred...
Didn't you hear Stoltzfus? What if he dies? Then the sheriff will come. They'll say we broke their laws -
Rachel, this is a man's life, we hold it in our hands.
Eli, John is a carpenter.  As well as being a fine policeman.
He's not in this building.
To see?
From now on you'll be history
...have you come back?
What are you going to do with my dog?  Give him back to me!
Toto's my dog.
Yes, I'm ready now.
Yes --
Oh --
Aw, come, come, come --
...room --
...bed.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, are you all right?
Oh! They're - they're gone now.
I - I guess they tried to, but they bent their stingers.
Oh - I'll get it!
And him a brain.
No.  Why only --  Oh --
...yes.
Oh, my!
A home --
Oh -- unusual weather we're having, ain't it?
Oh, but -- but please. It's very important.
Your Majesty, if you were king You wouldn't be afraid of anything?
I'd be too scared to ask him for it.
Because I'm still scared!
Well, why don't you use them?  When you come home, don't go by Miss Gulch's place.  Then Toto won't get in her garden, and you won't get in no trouble.  See?
Um-hmm.
But maybe you'd better not.  I've got a witch mad at me, and you might get into trouble.
The other side....
...just that the Witch is so wicked. I don't think you two ought to come with me because you'll get into trouble.
I don't like this forest!  It's -- it's dark and creepy!
...along.
-- A hot water bottle would be good if we had one.
No -- No -- No -- No!
Real courage. That's what we want.
What if it were a brontosaurus?
What happened?
Oh, you did it yourself!
They sure knocked the stuffings out of you, didn't they?
Not even a rhinoceros?
It's a whatzis.
There. Now, that's the best we can do without any pins.
...the door! Open the door! Open the door! Open the door! Open the door!
Quiet!
That's right.
Animals that -- that eat straw?
Then I'm sure to get a brain --
Come on -- come on --
Oh - oh, poor Dorothy!
Oh, this is terrible -- can't budge her an inch!  This is a spell, this is!
Oh, did - did you see that?
It's a whozis.
They tore my legs off, and they threw them over there! Then they took my chest out, and they threw it over there!
Whew! That wasn't my plan - but something happened, didn't it?
-- And the courage that you promised Cowardly Lion?
You new?
Who's she?
The King pipeline.
What kind of bikes did you ride?
We've got to get out.
Dislocated collar bone.  If any more tendons snap...  It won't just be two weeks out of action.
007. What do you know of the Caspian Sea?
Claude Serrault.  A.K.A...
Now Robert is dead. He got his revenge.
They're getting their weapons from the Russians, but where are they getting the money to buy the weapons?  I can't help thinking...the person close to King, the one who switched that pin...
Your last chance. Take the money.
I met you at my father's funeral.
I haven't been able to recall a single moment of that day...until now.
The killer doesn't want to see this pipeline continue, doesn't want to see you take over...
James...
If this little show is for my benefit, I'll take you home right now.
I understand it's normally good practice to get the feel of the cards before going off the deep end.
How did you survive?
One... last... screw?
That is 5,000 dollars of Beluga ruined!
This is too big for even you.  Where is it?
What?
The parcel's in the post.
Any word from him?
Walter --
And what -- split -- the dog's skull open?
Walter.  This compulsion of yours -- to punish transgressors.  In your mind . . . what gives you the right to judge?
Rorschach's on the case.  He's got Dreiberg in a lather.  He seems to think that someone is "stalking" the Watchmen.
What's your theory?
I guess you'll be dismantling Russian tanks soon.
I'm not here.  I'm still on Mars.  I've come to collect you.
The atmosphere.  I'm sorry.  These things slip my mind.
I can't stand any more of this.  I want to go back.  If I'm going to die I want to be with -- other people.
Then do me a favor.  If the world's going to end, it shouldn't matter a bit.  I want you to cure me.
Jon -- for God's sake, what do you see?
The Comedian.  He's dead.  Murdered.  That's all I know.
He's bound to get caught.  I don't want my name coming out.  Not at this late date.
Who?
Yeah.  See, I've been working on a little project.  Top secret, of course . . .
Psychotic pig.  He had it coming.  Mr. CTU . . .
Of course, we looked like idiots in those bondage outfits.
They're not following me, Dan.  I mean -- Jon's gone, we're right on the brink of World War III.  Nobody cares about the Watchmen.
Oh.  No.  Sorry.  I'll be right down the hall if you want me . . . I mean, if you need some aspirin, or --
His what?
Eight cops?  Oh, great.  A jury's gonna love that.
-- What is it.
You're full of yourself.  What are you doing?
Dan -- what do we do now?
So do I.  So do you.
. . . And they call me a fucking nut.
I'll say.  If we ever get off this looney-tune project, I'm gonna head straight for civilization and buy me a big thick steak.
Nothing.  What were you going to say?
No.  No.  Cut.  -- Justine, we agreed.  No questions about the Watchmen.
You're not "protecting" anyone.  These people's lives may depend on the answers you give.  These are all former associates of Dr. Manhattan --
Sit down, Miss Juspeczyk.  As I mentioned, the people in this file are all close associates of Dr. Manhattan.  They have something else in common as well.  They've all developed a fairly . . . exotic form of lymphatic cancer.
Six to eight months.  That's with treatment.  -- Perhaps now you can see why it's so vital that we locate your . . . friends.
Adrian!  Don't leave so soon.  I --
Laurie -- he's the most powerful man who's ever lived.  He's changed the world.
What about you?
Gila Flats -- place where Jon turned into . . .
Who the hell are you?
Whether you thought this was for real or not, you jumped in and helped the waitress on instinct. That tells me something about your character.
It's your lucky day. You just might get the chance to pay back our wonderful country for all the freedom you enjoy.
Congratulations, you've just graduated at the head of your class.
You're perceptive too. I forgot to add that to the list of surprises. I'm with the National Security Agency. And unlikely as it may sound, I need your help.
Now I'm the one who's nauseous. So what's the deal? What do you need me for?
I expect you to call in regularly with progress reports.
Up yours.
Is that all?
I guess you got my E-mail. I set up a purchase. Ten cars.
This is good work, X, damn fine work. You need to press on at all costs, find out what they have planned with this "Ahab".
